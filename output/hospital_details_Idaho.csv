Idaho,Idaho State Hospital North,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Idaho_State_Hospital_North,1905,,1905,Active,Cottage Plan,,Northern Idaho Sanitarium & Insane Asylum | State Hospital North,"Authorized by state legislature in 1905, the hospital accepted it's first patients by the fall of that year. The first superintendent was Dr. John Weeks Givens.  Initially there were only twenty patients and five staff.  At first the patients were kept in a ""tent city"" until the main building was finished. Due to it's location, most patients had to be brought in by train.  The hospital had a strict military routine including inspections and marching daily.
By 1931 the name of the hospital was changed to State Hospital North.  The military routine had been replaced by other activities as a form of treatment.  1949 came with overcrowding for the one building, almost 600 patients in a building meant for only 450.  That same year the state passed reform for the over crowding and several smaller cottages were built.  In 1954 the population had been reduced to 488.  Two years later the patient work week was greatly reduced.
After a further drop in patient numbers, the hospital reported only 80 beds in 1971.  The following year the hospital started the Alcohol Treatment Unit followed by a juvenile diagnostic unit in 1978.  Today the hospital handles mainly court-committed patients.

Idaho,Idaho State Hospital South,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Idaho_State_Hospital_South,1885,,1886,Active,Single Building (Original),,Idaho Insane Asylum | South Idaho Sanitarium,"On July 2, 1886, four years before Idaho was granted statehood, the Idaho Insane Asylum opened its doors.  At that time, patients with mental illness were referred to as “inmates” and were committed for life with the possibility of parole.  The psychiatric treatment of the inmates was primarily custodial care while working on the farm, in the garden, barns, orchards, shops and laundry.
Many of those who were sent to the hospital remained there for years, if not the rest of their lives. A Biennial Report of the Board of the Directors of the Idaho Insane Asylum for the years 1903-1904, illustrates the situation:
“The patients remaining in the asylum are coming to be more and more of the feeble-minded and helpless class of the old who require increased care. There are a number of patients here who have been insane for more than 20 years and a still greater number who have been insane for 10 or 15 years. All hope of recovery has passed in these cases and whatever of the joy and comfort of living remain for them must be had in the asylum.”
Today State Hospital South in Blackfoot provides psychiatric inpatient treatment and skilled nursing care for Idaho’s adult and adolescent citizens with the most serious and persistent mental illnesses. The hospital works in partnership with families and communities to enable clients to return to community living. The facility is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, and is certified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. State Hospital South includes 90 psychiatric adult beds, 29 skilled nursing beds, and 16 beds for adolescents. It also maintains a statewide program to restore competency of criminal justice patients.",,"Blackfoot, ID",,

Idaho,Nampa State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Nampa_State_School,,,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Idaho Sanitarium for the Feeble-minded and Epileptic  | Idaho State School and Hospital | Southwest Idaho Treatment Center,"Idaho State School and Hospital was built in Nampa in 1910, for the state's Developmental developmentally challenged population. It opened in 1918. The institution was largely self sufficient. It had a large farm which was worked by the residents. The higher functioning residents also cared for residents who couldn't do anything for themselves. Much has changed in the care of persons with developmental disabilities from the time of the state school's opening. The old farm has been sold as a golf course, and residents no longer give primary care to other residents. The institution is much more modern and remains in operation, though a few of the old buildings are now used to house juvenile offenders",,"Nampa, ID",,

The college served students pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree until 1938. Because the Methodist Church had provided substantial funds to keep the school going, the buildings were donated to the church when the school closed.
In 1941 the Methodist Church gave the building to the state of Idaho for the development of a tuberculosis hospital, however, shortages of equipment and personnel during World War II delayed the opening of the hospital until May 1947. The hospital was in operation until 1976. After the building was abandoned, Idaho State legislators have wondered what to do with the building and there have been unsuccessful attempts to have the building demolished. Recently the building was purchased by Gary Hannon, who refurbished a small section of the historic building to house guests at the ""Get Inn"". He offers eight guestrooms, which had previously served as the nurses' dorms when the Idaho State Tuberculosis Hospital was in operation.
