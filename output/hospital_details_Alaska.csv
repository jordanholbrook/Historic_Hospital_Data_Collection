Alaska,Alaska State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Alaska_State_Hospital,1956,,1962,Active,Single Building,,Alaska Psychiatric Institute,"Prior to statehood in 1959, there were few mental health services available in the territory of Alaska for individuals who experienced mental illness or developmental disabilities. At the time, mental illness was considered a crime. People with any sort of mental disability who were unable to care for themselves or who could not be cared for by a family member or guardian were charged and convicted as “an insane person at large.” Those convicted of this crime were sent by the federal government to live in Morningside Hospital, a private institution in Oregon. By 1942, more than 2,000 people from Alaska, including very young children, were residing there.
During Alaska’s transition to a state, Congress passed the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956 to bring these individuals home. This act transferred the responsibility for providing mental health services from the federal government to the territory of Alaska and ultimately the state, by creating the Alaska Mental Health Trust. To fund it, the state selected one million prime acres of land that would be managed to generate income to help pay for a comprehensive and integrated mental health program in Alaska.",,Anchorage,,
Alaska,Harbor View Nursing Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Harbor_View_Nursing_Home,1960,,1961,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"1960 marked the beginning of a change in the way the State of Alaska provided care for its mentally disabled residents. Prior to this, mentally disabled individuals had been sent to institutions out of state. After much work and many hours of debate, the Legislature began a process that would bring these residents back to their home state for care.
In January 1960 Governor Bill Egan, a former grocer from Valdez, announced that the new state would purchase the former Brady Apartment Buildings in Valdez for $98,000. Six of the twelve one-story concrete block buildings were re-modeled into a residential center for 50 developmentally disabled people. This facility was named the “Harborview Nursing Home”. In 1961, as soon as the buildings were ready, 50 new residents were transferred from Portland to Valdez on a chartered flight.
There were many more developmentally disabled Alaskans, however, who needed to return to Alaska. In 1963 – just two years after opening – remodeling began to convert the last of the Brady Apartments.
The 1964 Earthquake devastated Valdez. The Harborview buildings were destroyed and the residents had to be evacuated to Anchorage until the community could recover. Finally, on May 4, 1967, the State of Alaska’s new 4-million dollar “Harborview Memorial Hospital” was opened in New Valdez. There was a section for a community hospital and a section for the care and education of developmentally disabled residents.
This new facility housed 125 residents and had 128 staff members, including 65 on the nursing staff. The staff took pride in the work they did during the tumultuous years surrounding the Earthquake. In a newsletter from that period of time, a staff member stated that they had tried to encourage privacy, warmth, and homelike atmosphere with partitions, bright colors, carpets, lamps, clocks, mirrors, and pets. A gymnasium and classrooms were added on in 1971.
At Harborview in the 1970s, programs and services for the developmentally disabled included residential living; a school; opportunities for residents to interact with the community; training in independent living and job skills; and social services. Harborview operated in its New Town location near the duck flats until it closed permanently in October 1997. [1]",1997,Valdez,,
Alaska,Jesse Lee Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jesse_Lee_Home,Moved to Seward in 1925,,,Closed,Cottage Plan,"John Holm (Jewel Guard Hall, Goode Hall), 
A.S. Hanson (Balto Building)",,"The Jesse Lee Home, begun by the Methodist Church, had its beginnings as an orphanage in Alaska in 1890. In 1925, the home was moved to Seward, where it eventually grew to several buildings on a 100-acre site. The home offered housing, education, and health care to resident children until 1964 when it sustained severe damage in the Good Friday Earthquake. Goode Hall, one of the original dormitories, was demolished after the earthquake due to extensive damage.
Many Alaska Native children lived in the home, often sent there as a result of the ravages of epidemics of influenza and tuberculosis that hit villages for years throughout Alaska. Among its more famous residents were Benny Benson, designer of Alaska’s flag; Peter Gordon Gould, founder of Alaska Methodist University; and Simeon Oliver, pianist, composer, and writer. Another former resident, James Lewis Simpson, said he arrived at the home in 1929 when he was four years old. He remained there until he graduated from high school at age 17.
Simpson, who is Ahtna Athabascan, spent his earliest years in Chickaloon, his mother’s home. When his family ran into difficulties and was not able to care for him, he was put on the train in Anchorage and sent to the home in Seward. He doesn’t recall being frightened when he arrived late in the day, but rather very amazed and curious about his new surroundings. He said he amazed his caregivers to nearly the same degree when he told them he needed to say his prayers before getting into bed.
Simpson declines to analyze the type of care he got at the home, but simply suggests that his service in World War II, followed by the attainment of a bachelor’s degree and teaching certificate and eventually master’s and doctorate degrees speak for themselves. After a successful teaching career in Alaska, he and his wife retired to Oregon.
