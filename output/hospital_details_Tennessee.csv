Tennessee,Bolivar State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bolivar_State_Hospital,1885,,1889,Active,Kirkbride Plan,Harry P. MacDonald/Adolphus Heiman,Western Hospital For the Insane | Western State Mental Hospital | Western Mental Health Institute,"Opened to receive patients on November 22, 1889, the then denoted ""West Tennessee Hospital for the Insane"" was designed by architect Harry P. MacDonald of Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis, Tennessee. The MacDonald firm was responsible for many fine, large public buildings in the South, such as the Sevier County Courthouse in Sevierville, Tennessee
(1896). The institution was intended not only to meet the mental health needs of the Western Section of the State, but also to complete Tennessee's first efforts at implementing a social policy initiated before the Civil War. Tennessee initiated its public policy regarding the institutionalization of the mentally-ill in the 1840s. The ""lunatic asylum"" in Nashville soon proved inadequate and architect Adolphus Heiman produced a Gothic Revival design following the advice of Thomas S. Kirkbride.
By 1892, 319 patients were living in the mental hospital. Entertainment, work, diet, and discipline were still considered the main types of therapy. In 1900 the hospital was overcrowded with 594 patients. It was continually being modernized and around 1910 a new wing was built. When weather allowed, the unfinished wing was used as sleeping quarters for several patients. Other additions to the facility were constructed in the 1920s. These included a tubercular hospital or ward and a congregate dining room. In 1927 the two story brick Doctors' Apartment Building was constructed, while an adjacent frame cottage was built by the family of a former patient. These structures emphasize the growth of professional medical staff as well as changes in therapies in treating the mentally ill.
Therapy in the 1920s and 1930s ""tended to be highly eclectic."" This was true at Western as well, under the administration of Dr. Edwin W. Cocke. ""He was author of the 1919 Tennessee State Law which dealt with the legal aspects of psychiatric patients' treatment, and he was co-producer of the first diathermy to produce artificial fever in the treatment of syphilis of the brain and allied diseases."" These new treatments included fever therapy, prefrontal lobotomy, metrazol and insulin shock, while occupational therapy was also still relied upon. Dr.Cocke was likewise a pioneer in the use of the then novel insulin shock therapy devised by Viennese physician Manfred Sakel. Sakel had observed mental changes in diabetic drug addicts who were treated with insulin. ""The injection of a sufficiently large dose of insulin drastically lowered the sugar content of the blood and ... induced a hypoglycemic state. In this state of 'shock,' the patient went into a deep coma which could be relieved by. ..sugar. After the process was over the patient's mental condition appeared to improve."" Dr. Sakel's visits to the United States in the 1930s helped popularize this therapy, although it was abandoned by most American mental institutions in the 1950s. Along with insulin shock therapy, metrazol therapy swept across the country from 1937 to 1940.
The institution's patient population grew from a few hundred in the 1890s to over 2,000 in the 1960s as patients remained hospitalized for decades. Many were crowded into large dormitories and had little privacy. With a limited number of doctors and attendants and a large patient population, many were simply ""warehoused."" Patients at Western received the treatments available in their period of institutionalization. These treatments ranged from hydrotherapy and insulin shock therapy to lobotomies and electric shock therapy. With the severe staff limitations, however, patients were fortunate to receive ten minutes per week with a psychiatrist.
The system for securing financing for patient care limited the operating budget. In Tennessee, there were three classes of patients: the state-pay patients, the county-pay patients, and the private-pay patients. State agencies agreed to pay for one patient out of a population of one thousand. Once this portion of the payment had been satisfied, the county was responsible for additional costs. The county payments consistently lagged behind, and superintendents had to engage in deficit spending to keep the hospital operating. The two most influential superintendents, Dr. Edwin Cocke and Dr. Edwin Levy, often faced political pressure from state officials, but both managed to make some improvements in the care offered at Western.
In modern times, ""deinstitutionalization"" produced a marked decrease in the patient population as mental health experts called for treatment of the mentally ill in local mental health clinics. Although there have been indications that this treatment has not been successful, it continues to the present time, and the indigent mentally ill continue to pose a major problem for society.

There are two cemetery sites; the earlier one on the west side of the hospital grounds and the more recent one .22 miles north on Stevens Road, which runs off of Hwy 64 about 1/2 mile east of the hospital. These cemeteries contain hundreds of interments of patients whose remains were not claimed by family members. The graves were originally marked with small white numbered markers, most of which are now missing or damaged and unreadable. A few of the graves are marked with larger tombstones, placed there by family members.

William Lyon, after more than a dozen years of funding stops and starts and political infighting. The East Tennessee Hospital for the Insane opened in 1886 with 99 patients transferred from the older Tennessee Lunatic Asylum in Nashville. In 1920, the facility's name was changed to Eastern State Hospital as part of a program to rename all of the asylums in the state.
In 1956, Gov. Frank Clement tours Eastern State, calls what he saw — including 984 patients sleeping on floor pallets because of lack of beds — sad but not surprising. Following the 1955 invention of the tranquilizer, the hospital adopted a new form of treatment. In 1960, they introduced the $2 million Therapeutic Village, which included cottages, a store, a clinic, a coffee bar, a chapel and a pool. Gov. Winfield Dunn appointed a committee to investigate conditions after Rep. Richard Krieg leads unannounced post-midnight visit to overcrowded wards in 1971. The Committee found too little staff, too little training, and unsanitary and inhumane conditions in aging buildings.
By 1977, the hospital's name was changed to Lakeshore Mental Institute. Shortly thereafter, in 1980, the state began their plan to shift the patients at Lakeshore to community. State revenue shortfall in 1990 forced reduction of staff, beds; long-term patients released into community. More than half of new admissions denied. State ""census"" of mentally ill among homeless suggests figure jumped from 12 percent in 1986 to 47 percent.  On June 30, 2012 after 126 years of operation, Lakeshore Mental Health Institute officially closed as part of a $25 million budget reduction measure. Not much later, in the spring of 2013, a former employee found patients' records laying in one the buildings, which contained case numbers, dates of birth and Social Security numbers. All buildings have been demolished, except for the administration building of the Kirkbride. The property is now a city park.

The cemetery is located on Lyons View Drive in West Knoxville.  The cemetery at present lies adjacent to Tennessee State Veterans Cemetery at the intersection of Lyons View Drive and Northshore Drive.  It is located behind the Episcopal Church of the Ascension.  The cemetery, which was first used in the late 1880's, has over 4,000 interments with most being unmarked.  Number markers were erected by the Hospital at one time, but these records have long since been destroyed as a result of the privacy act.  A few graves have markers that were erected by family members.  It later became the custom after the 1960's to send unclaimed bodies to the Memphis State Medical Facility for use in classroom studies.

Opened in 1961, the facility now serves a 23 county area in Upper Cumberland and southeast regions of Tennessee, with an estimated population of over 750,000 people.
MBMHI was built on land donated by Hamilton County and the City of Chattanooga. The grounds, nestled at the foot of scenic Lookout Mountain and next to the Tennessee River, provide a private, rural setting close to a metropolitan area.
The land on which the complex is located is of historical importance, having once been part of the Cherokee Nation, and the site of a Civil War battle. The remains of an ancient Native American village were recently discovered and portions of the Moccasin Bend area are now part of the Chattanooga/Chickamauga National Park.
MBMHI currently offers 100 adult acute care and 50 adult sub-acute care beds. All emergency involuntary admissions are prescreened by a mandatory pre-screening agent from one of the four regional private, non-profit community mental health centers (or by a physician or psychologist, if a mandatory pre-screening agent is not available within 2 hours), and are referred to the institute if inpatient treatment is necessary.

Tennessee,Tennessee State Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tennessee_State_Training_School,,,1911,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,State Training School for Boys at Jordonia | Spencer Youth Center,"From the time of its founding in 1911 to its closing in 1971, ""Jordonia"" — once a quiet little community in northwestern Davidson County now considered part of Bordeaux — became a word well known to school kids across Tennessee. Thanks to the institution for boys, it meant ""reform school,"" incarceration and chilling punishment for bad behavior. White students were threatened with that word. African-American ones heard ""Pikeville"" — in Bledsoe County where a similar facility for black youths was located. Much like today's facilities for troubled youths, their reputations were sometimes unfair and other times deserved. Also like today, recurring escapes, staffing and funding proved to be constant problems.
Lacy Elrod, named superintendent of the Jordonia facility in 1939, came from an education background and wanted to replace the facility's penal aspects with those of learning. Just four years earlier, guards had been indicted for mistreating inmates.By the early 1940s, conditions had already degenerated. A series of stories by later Pulitzer Prize winner Nat Caldwell in The Tennessean included such 1942 headlines as:
""Last Illegally Used on Boys, State Official Admits Whippings by Guards at School Forbidden"" and ""Jordonia Guards on Probation … "" with a state official saying ""He'll Fire Drunks and Inefficient Workers.""
In 1948, new Superintendent Fain C. Potter was determined to upgrade the overcrowding and conditions. He found 68 of the children housed there, those between age 8 and 12, were sharing a single room with cracked plaster in a 30-year-old building.
The 260 older kids were crowded into bunk beds in three buildings, none of which was ""fireproof."" Expansion was Potter's push. His dream was not fully realized until 1956 when the 1918 and 1942 buildings were finally replaced with a 200-bed modern dormitory and an administration building, for a total of $547,000 in state funds, plus another $310,000 96-bed dorm. By 1953, Jordonia was limited to boys ages 12-17, but the school still had three under 12 among its 275 population.
The story of Jordonia's counterpart for blacks in Pikeville on the Cumberland Plateau was even worse. Attention was not focused on its conditions until a violent series of events in 1944 that included two murders and a ""lynching."" Both the wife and 19-year-old daughter of H.E. Scott, superintendent of the State Training and Agricultural School for Negro Boys, were fatally assaulted with a variety of axes and knives. A student at the school was accused and arrested. Before James T. Scales, 17, the trusty charged, could go to court, he was forcibly removed by a group of men from the Bledsoe County Jail, returned to the school site and shot to death by a single mob participant there. The vigilante killing went unsolved, despite rewards offered at the time by Nashville ministers and Vito Marcantonio's International Labor Defense fund.
A state probe of the Pikeville facility that was prompted by the violence revealed the ""school"" had no instruction ""of any sort,"" and that its buildings ""were not habitable for human beings."" Boys were forced in some cases to sleep two to three per bed because of overcrowding. One room had only 43 beds for 93 youths. Sometimes filthy mattresses on the floor were the only choice. The young inmates had to prepare their own food, served on unsterilized metal plates in a dining room described as ""cold, with broken windows and doors, gloomy, dirty and bad-smelling."" But by December of 1945, Pikeville also had been turned around, according to news accounts. Modern, fire-resistant concrete-block dorms replaced the old ones. Food was much improved.
Much of the credit was given to a new superintendent, Lake Russell. During the first month of his tenure, escapes were reported to have dropped from 15 monthly to none. Nashville's Jordonia the same year was still experiencing them. Three youthful escapees were arrested in Memphis after a ""wild 10-mile chase"" that ended with their car crashing into a storefront window. In 1948, the bodies of two 15-year-old Jordonia escapees were found in the Cumberland River. Another that year turned himself in, ""tired and hungry after three days."" By 1965, the state's youth centers were integrated. In 1971, Jordonia became the Spencer Youth Center and Pikeville had been replaced by the James M. Taft Youth Center.
In 1977, 14- to 18-year-old property offenders were being sent to Spencer and repeat offenders, or those who had committed crimes against people, were sent to Taft. The next year, corporal punishment was banished at juvenile institutions. Today, Spencer Youth Center has been replaced by Woodland Hills Youth Development Center at 3965 Stewarts Lane. Opened in 1990, it once served up to 120 male students from Middle Tennessee and 24 females from across the state.",1971,"Jordonia, TN",,
Tennessee,Tennessee Vocational School for Colored Girls,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tennessee_Vocational_School_for_Colored_Girls,,,1923,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,State Vocational School | Tennessee Guidance and Reception Center for Children,"The Tennessee Vocational School for Colored Girls opened in Nashville on October 9, 1923. Prior to its opening, the state confined African American girls who needed correctional services in institutions with convicted adults. In opposition to this practice, Frankie Pierce, an African American activist, initiated a campaign for the establishment of a correctional school for girls.
In April 1921 the Tennessee General Assembly authorized the establishment of the Tennessee Vocational School for Colored Girls and appropriated fifty thousand dollars to purchase a site and construct a building. The state selected a sixty-six-acre site on Heiman Street near the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal School (now Tennessee State University). When the school opened, it served African American girls aged twelve through fifteen from across the state, whom the courts judged to be delinquent. Frankie Pierce, the school's first superintendent (1923-39), planned and implemented a personal development program that emphasized health, recreation, physical needs, moral training, and religion. She instilled an appreciation for the dignity of labor and encouraged the girls to become self-supporting. Nearby Hubbard Hospital at Meharry Medical College provided medical and dental care for the girls. In addition, the school employed a part-time physician to meet student health needs.
During the first year of operation, the school served thirty-five girls from eight Tennessee counties. These juveniles had been convicted of offenses ranging from ""incorrigibility and bad conduct"" to intent to murder. A fire on December 12, 1923, destroyed the contents of the school, but donations from across the state quickly replaced the loss.
During the years 1928-30, the school served as many as sixty-seven girls from sixteen counties. Program directors rationalized that most girls would enter domestic service after leaving the program and emphasized sewing, cooking, house cleaning, and laundering. During this same period, the school expanded its educational offerings to include grades one through twelve. Of the girls who completed their sentences during this period, thirty-four returned to their homes, and thirteen entered domestic service.
During the 1940s the school offered military training and created a cadet corps of two battalions. Increasingly, the school utilized city and county services for the girls. During the week the girls attended Haynes High School (a county school) for their high school coursework. On Sundays, the school transported them to city churches for religious services. In 1948 the school's cosmetology department, established in 1943, received accreditation.
By 1956-57 the physical plant had grown from the original building to include five brick structures. That year, the State Department of Education accredited the elementary and junior high school programs of the institution, the staff of five certified instructors expanded to include a psychologist, and child care and commercial training (typing) were added to the curriculum.
The Department of Correction desegregated all Tennessee juvenile correctional institutions during the 1966-67 academic year and prepared to close the Tennessee Vocational School for Colored Girls, changing its name to the State Vocational School. The school initiated a prerelease cottage program, upgraded the remedial reading program, and emphasized academic subjects. During the period 1968-70, the program added counseling and psychiatric services and expanded recreational activities. The population increased to 103 girls, and the school encouraged parental visitation.
In 1970-71 the school became the Tennessee Guidance and Reception Center for Children. The staff of sixty-nine expanded to include a full-time licensed practical nurse and a full-time chaplain. The institution closed in 1979.

It was located near Tullahoma, at 35°20'22.6""N 86°11'32.6""W.
The school was founded in 1915 by the Tennessee Federation of Women's Clubs. It was called the State Reformatory for Girls. It received its first girls in 1918; the cost to house an inmate for one year was approximately $230.57 (.63/day).
Instructors originally taught only cooking and sewing. They began to train girls to type, take shorthand, do dressmaking and work as nurses aides when the market for women employees expanded. In the 1950's, the girls also learned “the science of cosmetics.”
According to Nell Farrar, superintendent from 1934-1958, the girls got “spiritual help, but [it wasn't] rammed down their throats.""
There were an average of 160 girls at TVS at a time. The girls stayed about 18 months. During that time Miss Farrar tried ""to make worthwhile citizens out of wayward youth.""
On March 10, 1954, an 18-year-old inmate, Avanell Dye Anderson, died of an apparent suicide from ingesting laundry bleach.
On February 15, 1955, three girls escaped TVS; one was caught, but two (Leddie Jane Chapman and Dolores) managed to make it to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and caused a considerable stir there before being caught by the local authorities.
In 1972 it was renamed Highland Rim School for Girls. In 1975 the bars were removed from its windows. In 1978 it became the sole receiving facility for female juvenile offenders in Tennessee. Highland Rim closed in 1983 and in 1984 the Tennessee Correction Academy became operational at the site.",,"Tullahoma, TN",,
Tennessee,Kennedy General Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kennedy_General_Hospital,1942,,1943,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Gen. James M. Kennedy Hospital | Kennedy Veterans Affairs Hospital,"Kennedy General Hospital opened at the intersection of Park and Getwell on January 26, 1943 and was named for the late Brigadier General James M. Kennedy, distinguished Army surgeon and veteran of both the Spanish-American War and World War I. Over the next three years, the hospital grew to be the largest Army general hospital in the nation. Kennedy had an emergency capacity of 5,300 beds and a peak of 6,000 patients in June and July, 1945.
During the three-year period of time, the hospital cared for more than 44,000 patients and received the Meritorious Service Unit Plaque for “superior performance of duty in the performance of exceptionally difficult tasks during the period of January 1, 1943 to January 1, 1946.”
The height of World War II in 1944 was filling Army hospitals around the nation with thousands of seriously wounded soldiers. In the first year of operation over 10,000 soldiers had been treated at Kennedy, all transported by train from the Normal Depot at the Memphis State Collage campus. In January, 1944, Kennedy received the first convoys of soldiers transported by air from coastal hospitals, and in July of that year, it received the casualties from the Battle of France. More than 50 percent of the patients in 1944 were combat-wounded veterans, returned from overseas. Duty personnel at Kennedy in 1944 included 200 officers, 400 nurses and over 1,200 enlisted men and women in service.
One of the greatest services to be initiated at Kennedy this year was the Reconditioning Program through which convalescing patients were retrained and reconditioned for return to duty through planned exercises and athletics and by the constructive use of leisure time in educational pursuits.[1] Kennedy treated all types of casualties but specialized in surgery, with an average of 30 operations a day. It had a large center for the treatment of spinal cord injuries and paraplegia and the second largest neuropsychiatry service in the nation.
The hospital closed in 1967 and was turned over to the University of Memphis. Out of the 116 buildings that once made up Kennedy Hospital, 21 remain, according to Tony Poteet, assistant vice president of campus planning and design. Of those 21, all but one remains in use.",1967,"Memphis, TN",,
Tennessee,Mountain Home VA Medical Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mountain_Home_VA_Medical_Center,1901,,1903,Active,Cottage Plan,Joseph H. Freedlander,Mountain Branch National Sanatorium,"Established in 1901 and commonly referred to as Mountain Home, the Mountain Branch (now the Mountain Home VA Medical Center) is in Johnson City, Tennessee, close to the border between Virginia and North Carolina. Set in the Smoky Mountains, the campus, by design, commands views of the beautiful mountain peaks and valleys.  The formal Beaux Arts campus contrasts with the wildness of the surrounding natural setting.  The landscape, most of the historic buildings, and the National Cemetery remain intact, with modern hospital facilities concentrated predominately in the eastern portion of the campus.  The medical center is associated with the James H. Quillen College of Medicine at East Tennessee State University (ETSU), and the medical school has rehabilitated a number of the historic buildings to use as classrooms.
Congressman Walter Preston Brownlow was instrumental in establishing another National Home branch in the South.  To convince the Board of Managers, he cited the high number of Southerners who fought for the Union in the Civil War and the fact that the Board had recently built a National Home in Virginia.  He felt the mountains of Tennessee provided a good climate for veterans, especially those suffering from respiratory conditions.  The new branch opened for its first patient in 1903.  Brownlow became the local manager of the branch and worked hard to provide the best amenities he could for the veterans there.  He obtained funds from Andrew Carnegie and others to establish a library and started a streetcar line to transport veterans and visitors from the branch to Johnson City.
Mountain Branch became a tuberculosis facility, because the Board of Managers determined that mountain air was good for the patients.  Mountain Branch and Battle Mountain Sanitarium (in South Dakota) treated tuberculosis. Patients from other branches who could travel came to one of these two branches. In 1911, the campus was modified to serve new veterans’ needs by building a tuberculosis cottage and reserving a ward in the hospital for very ill tuberculosis patients.  This was done to keep the highly contagious patients separate from the non-tubercular patients on the campus.  These tubercular patients were even prohibited from going to any social activities for fear of contagion.  In 1921, Mountain Home officially became a tuberculosis sanitarium in response to great concern about the spread of the disease, especially after the outbreaks during World War I.  The facility added a tuberculosis ward for African Americans at this time and medical staff was increased to handle the increased number of patients.
Mountain Branch is characterized by its hilly terrain and intermittently wooded slopes.  Joseph H. Freedlander designed the original plan and buildings for the branch.  Freedlander laid out the Beaux Arts brick veneer buildings in formal symmetry facing southeast so patients could view the Great Smoky Mountains in the distance.  The branch is typical of the Beaux Arts style with its wide streets and open landscape spaces.  This uniformity is different from other National Home branches, which generally used a variety of architectural styles and had grounds designed in a picturesque or romantic manner.  The few new buildings on campus are in a style sympathetic to the Beaux Arts buildings that Freedlander designed, which gives the campus a cohesive appearance. Carl Andersen may have been responsible for the landscape design; after his death a local newspaper noted that he was the chief landscape architect for the branch.
The main boulevard on the campus, Dogwood Avenue, runs east to west.  The Administration Building (Building 52) anchors the west end of Dogwood Avenue.  Facing east down Dogwood Avenue, the two-story red brick building’s central projecting bay highlights the main entryway with two single and two double brick columns.  The building is currently leased by the ETSU Medical School to house the Department of Psychiatry.  The original, historic hospital (Building 69), which dates from 1905, stands at the eastern end of Dogwood Avenue.  Also in the Beaux Arts style, this building no longer serves as a hospital but now houses administrative and clinical offices for the VA.  Behind the historic hospital building is a complex of new buildings that are now the hospital and outpatient clinic.
At the center of Dogwood Avenue stands the most notable building on campus, the Mess Hall (Building 34), with its prominent clock tower and elaborate Beaux Arts detailing.  The clock tower projects out from the T-plan building.  It is currently used by the VA for engineering shops and research facilities and houses the Mountain Home Medical Center museum.
On each side of the Mess Hall are nearly identical barracks (Buildings 1 and 2) arranged in an east-west manner, facing south toward the Smoky Mountains.  The barracks have central entrances with semi-octagonal wings at either end.  The barracks currently house various departments of the ETSU Medical School.  Behind these two barracks are five more barracks (Buildings 3-7) in a less ornate, simplified Colonial Revival design. They still have the defining brick veneer.  The main entrances have projecting bays supported at the corners with large brick pillars and thinner pillars inside. Two of these barracks are vacant. The other barracks are used by the ETSU Medical School.
Behind the barracks are the recreational facilities of the campus. The Beaux Arts Chapel (Building 13) with its Catholic and Protestant sanctuaries was inspired by the Mission style. The chapel's tower houses a shared vestibule at the southeast corner that conceals two entrances: one leading to the Catholic sanctuary, the other to the Protestant sanctuary. The chapel is currently not open to the public because of structural issues. Memorial Hall (Building 35) is just to the east of the chapel. It functioned as a theater and still has much of its interior grandeur and orchestra pit intact.  The ETSU Theater Department leases the building.  South of the Memorial Hall is the Carnegie Library (Building 17)-- one of two known to exist at National Home branches. The VA and ETSU Medical School use the library as a lecture hall. To the northwest of the hospital complex are medical staff duplexes (Buildings 39-43) built in the 1920s in response to the increase in membership after the facility’s transition to a tuberculosis sanitarium. These Colonial Revival duplexes are vacant, except for one that the VA uses for engineering offices.
The western portion of campus also has a 1920s duplex. This section is the location of most of the single quarters (Buildings 44-47). They are also Colonial Revivals built in the 1920s to house additional staff. The majority of these are vacant. [1]
At the northern end of the campus is the National Cemetery, which has a visitor’s center.  The Brownlow Monument is an obelisk that marks the graves of Congressman Walter Preston Brownlow and his wife. The monument is a reminder that Congressman Brownlow was responsible for the creation of the Mountain Branch. Most of the pre-1930 burials are located near the monument.",,"Johnson City, TN",Beaux Arts,

Hayden and Brown, for the treatment of alcohol and drug additions and diseases of the nervous system. Circa 1907 the sanitarium moved to 1400 Broadway. n 1909, Dr. M. R. Farrar, of North Carolina, purchased the interest of Dr. Hayden and the sanitarium was renamed Farrar and Brown Sanitarium. In 1910, still located at 1400 Broadway, Farrar and Brown dissolved the partnership. It was stated that Dr. Brown would take over the entire business and continue as before.  A notice in the Tennessean announced a name change to  Cumberland Sanitarium, with Dr. Brown named as medical director.  There did not seem to be any connection to Cumberland Sanitarium in Lebanon, Tennessee.  After 1911, Cumberland Sanitarium and Dr. Daniel Brown, disappear from Nashville.

This private outpatient hospital was dedicated to the treatment of alcoholism, drug addiction, and “nervous diseases and exhaustion from overwork”, as quoted from a 1940 advertisement. Drs. Walter Wallace and George Pettey, originally in practice as the De Narcotina Sanitarium downtown, moved their facility to a 116-acre campus just off Southern Avenue and opened their doors on July 14, 1924. At the time, it was a small railroad stop miles outside the city known as Cherry Station. Cherry Road is all that remains as evidence of this period. Wallace Sanitarium continued operation while The Village and other subdivisions slowly expanded around it. By the 1950's, the renamed Wallace Hospital was a teaching facility for Methodist Hospital medical students.

Tennessee,Middle Tennessee Tuberculosis Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Middle_Tennessee_Tuberculosis_Hospital,1942,,1954,Preserved,Single Building,,,"Tuberculosis was the No. 3 cause of death in Tennessee by 1943. As that year approached, Nashville was on the verge of getting approval for a much-needed state TB hospital to serve the whole Midstate area. A 65-bed hospital in the former home was dedicated in December 1942, but a bigger one came later.
Primarily because of the interruption of World War II, it wasn't until 1949 that a larger hospital was authorized, and it didn't open until March 1954. By then, tuberculosis was beginning to decline. It was the No. 9 killer in the country in 1953 and poised to drop to 13th place by 1955. A push for early detection and the use of antibiotics were working. In the early 20th century, the average hospital stay had been three years.
The narrow, seven-story, brick-fronted 1954 structure — still standing in a much-renovated fashion in 2006 — reflected institutional architecture of the day. Only the top floor with its four operating rooms, labs and morgue was air-conditioned. Such cooling remained a luxury in the early 1950s. But along with 224 beds, patients had ""pillow phones,"" bedside radios and steel awnings to help shield the cross-ventilation windows from solar heat.
With a steadily dwindling number of patients in later years, the state hospital closed its doors June 30, 1976. Its three patients were transferred to the state-operated chest disease hospital in Knoxville, and other jobs were found for most of the 213 employees. By then, drug treatments had made long periods of bed rest and isolation unnecessary. In 1984-86, the hospital building was stripped to its structural frame and rebuilt in a more modern style to house the Tennessee Department of Health's Laboratory Services section, its current use.",1976,"Nashville, TN",,

Tennessee,Benton County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Benton_County_Poor_Farm,1857,,1858,Demolished,,,,"In April of 1857, the court found it necessary to establish a poorhouse in Benton County. A commission was formed to find a location for the county poorhouse. A sum of $1200 was set aside for the purchase of the property when a suitable location was found. In January of 1958, the commission reported that a 45 acre site had been found just north of Bentonville. The property had a spring, a log cabin (without floor), 10 cultivated acres, and 4 acres in wheat. This land was purchased for $300 from William Clements and a survey of the property was done. The county then built the other necessary buildings on the property and moved the paupers of the county to the farm, placing them under the care of a superintendent.
When the new courthouse was completed in 1875, the temporary courthouse building was removed and resituated on the poor farm. The building was disassembled and reassembled on the the property by William Stewart and J, V. Lee at a cost of $330. An additional $120.50 was given to James Haney to be used for fitting the building out.  The poor farm housed an average of about 8 to 10 people at a time. It went by several other names, including the poorhouse, or the pauper's farm. In 1907, a special act of the general assembly changed the name to the Benton County Home. The people who lived at the poor farm were called inmates or paupers, which were common terms for the poor at the time.
In November of 1905, the Benton County Home was moved to a new location about where the Benton County Services building is located on Highway 102 West. The inmates were taken care of by a contract that provided a set amount day per inmate. In 1906, W. R. Ford was awarded a contract for 30 cents a day, which was intended to also provide board, clothing, and medical treatment. The lowest bid, which wasn't accepted, had been 15 cents. The contract system left the inmates at the mercy of the contractor, so the system was later abandoned, and a superintendent was hired for the county home. The County Home was open until the 1940s or 1950s when other facilities took its place.",1951,"Bentonville, AR",,

Tennessee,Davidson County Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Davidson_County_Asylum,1864,,,Active,,,Davidson County Poor Farm & Insane Asylum | Davidson County Hospital,"The first Davidson County institution for the aged, infirm and mentally ill operated from 1864 to 1879 on another site, the farm of 
Thomas Harris who served as its ""keeper.""  In April 1874, the county bought two tracts east of Gallatin Pike for 
$13,000 to serve as a farm residence for those in need, both the indigent and the mentally ill. The farms had previously belonged to 
the estate of Thomas L. Bransford (1804-1865), a merchant and railroad official, and to Charlotte P. Ramsey.
The area was then about 3½ miles outside the city of Nashville. The facility cost roughly $14,000 annually to operate, but those of 
its residents able to do farm work on the property helped offset ""a large portion"" of that through the county's sale of farm products, 
Clayton wrote. Three two-story buildings were built adjacent to each other, and a fourth was later added for a superintendent's residence, enclosing a 
sort of yard.
A three-member commission saw to its operation. By 1880, Isaac W. Lanier was the appointed superintendent, with his wife overseeing its 
""female department."" The facility housed about 150-190 people - roughly half of them African-American. The 1880 Census listed all of them with the term ""pauper."" The county 
physician saw to their medical needs. ""This is not known as a poorhouse, and it stands so high in the estimation of the citizens that it is considered no dishonor to be 
permitted to hire keeping there when disabled by age or infirmity,"" 
Clayton's history said.
Bordeaux Long-Term Care, Metro Nashville's current 420-bed nursing 
home on 121 acres northwest of downtown, began in 1893 as the 
successor to the poor farm. It provided various medical services to 
residents as Bordeaux Hospital until 1967 when its focus became
