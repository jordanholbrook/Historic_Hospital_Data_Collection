Washington,Eastern Washington State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Eastern_Washington_State_Hospital,,1890,May 1891,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),,Eastern State Hospital for the Insane | Eastern State Hospital,"The great distance in transporting patients to the Western Hospital for the Insane at Fort Steilacoom, which is situated in the extreme western part of the state, led to the erection of the Eastern State Hospital.
The first buildings were erected in 1890 and consisted of a central administration building, with a wing on each side and a rear wing for the kitchen, engine room and laundry. The entire plant was made of brick, with a granite foundation, lathed and plastered inside. Each wing was three stories high and accommodated 150 patients. The buildings were of the old Kirkbride plan. The building commissioners were D. M. Drumheller, B. B. Glasscock and Stanley Hallett. The first Board of Trustees, consisting of D. F. Percival, Dr. Wilson Lockhart and Charles McDouall, were appointed in 1890. In 1892 W. J. Dwyer was appointed in place of Dr. Wilson Lockhart, whose term had expired. This local board continued in office until 1897, when it was abolished and the State Board of Audit and Control assumed power.
In May, 1891, 20 patients were received from the Western Washington Hospital and in July, the same year, 102 more. These patients had been committed from counties east of the Cascade Mountains, the territory which thereafter was designated as the district especially belonging to this hospital. As the patient population quickly rose additional room became necessary. A second wing was erected for men in 1894. It was, like the two original wings, three stories high and accommodated 150 patients. While not fireproof, it was an improvement over the older wings, having all partitions made of brick and tile, with hard plaster finish. It had no rooms or dormitories in the front of the building, so the wards were exceedingly well lighted. The flooring was of maple and each ward had two fireplaces—one at each end.
Further growth of the hospital population made it necessary to erect additional wards for women. In 1903 a three-story wing, accommodating 105 patients, was built for women. It was somewhat similar in construction to Wing Two South, but the wards were not so well lighted, as there were four rooms in the front of the building on each ward. The floors were of fir instead of maple. Wing Three South was built in 1907 and accommodates 150 men patients. It is as nearly fireproof as can be made.
Wings Four South and Three North were completed about July, 1912. They are, like Wing Three South, practically fireproof, with many modern conveniences. Wing Four South was erected especially in view of caring for the convict insane. The number of convict insane is steadily increasing with the increase of the general population and they are too dangerous to keep in ordinary wards This wing is as light, airy and cheerful as any of the others, but specially prepared window guards and doors are installed.
Other additional improvements consisted of large dairy and stock barns, separate buildings for the carpenter and blacksmith shop, laundry, paint shop and bakery. A new farm house, with accommodations for the farmer, cook and 15 patients, has been erected on a detached farm. Improvements made and in course of construction consist of additions built to enlarge the congregate dining rooms, water closets, lavatories, bath rooms remodeled, floors and walls covered with white vitrified tiling, and modern sanitary plumbing installed in nine of the older wards.
Hydrotherapeutic apparatus was installed in 1912; and a modern equipped surgery centrally located, with dressing rooms on the wards. Six of the older wards were re-floored with white maple. A cold storage plant, with five large cooling boxes, each 8 feet by 20 feet by 8 feet, and granite and concrete root cellar, 120 feet by 36 feet, have been built, as well as a hay and straw barn. A modern dairy barn to accommodate 61 cows with milking machines; an aseptic milk-cooling room, and a cutting room, with electric-driven machinery. An entirely new poultry plant has been rebuilt to accommodate 1000 laying hens and the piggery remodeled on modern lines to accommodate 500 pigs There is also a fruit house 20 feet by 40 feet by 10 feet. A granite addition was made to the boiler room, doubling its capacity; also a new concrete coal bunker, with a capacity of 2000 tons.
At the end of 1914 The hospital owns 833 acres of land, about 400 of which are in cultivation. The population in 1914 consisted of 719 men and 337 women, a total of 1056.[1]
The Custodial Care phase represents the first five decades of the hospital’s operations. The main emphasis of this phase was the isolation or “asylum” of patients, separating them physically from the world to simplify patient lives and to protect those in the community. It also protected them from the community, as mental illness was heavily ostracized and stigmatized in those days; though there is still a significant stigma today, it is much less than at the turn of the century. At this point in history there was little to no understanding of the nature of mental illness; considered causes of illness at the time were “age, tobacco, constipation, whiskey, and morphia[sic],” and any person seen as problematic (alcoholics, the mentally retarded, those suffering depression, criminals) were placed in the hospital.
This disrespect and lack of understanding of patients can even be seen in the original name of the hospital, which from its 1891 opening until 1918 was called “Eastern State Hospital for the Insane.” Treatments were targeted at symptoms, and many of those treatments were completely ineffective. Such treatments included religious actions (prayer, exorcisms, forced religious study, etc.), physical restraint, and other punishments. The hospital suffered severe overcrowding and was very understaffed in this period, with a single attendant being responsible for 40-50 patients, working in 12 hour shifts, with a total of 800 patients in the original building. Over time, 22 new buildings would be added to the hospital complex and the population peaked at 2,274 in 1954. Many of these new buildings were the result of Works Project Administration spending during the Depression, which sought to both create jobs and to ease the overcrowding.
A significant development in therapy came in the 1930s. Daisy Lewis, an attendant, gave an insulin shot to a woman who didn’t recognize her husband nor daughter and was “completely oblivious to reality.” The effects wore off shortly and treatment was repeated, but it gave hope that there was something that could be done for patients. Despite the positive results such treatments had for some, they had numerous negative effects on patient health. Different kinds of convulsive therapies, or “shock therapies” (insulin shock, metrazol shock, electroshock), were used for all manner of patients, as these were the only treatments with any consistent efficacy yet discovered (though they were only truly effective on a small number). The overuse is clear in the hospital’s statement: “During a two year period in the early 1950s, over 1,100 patients received one of the convulsive therapies; altogether, about 15,000 treatments were administered.”
In World War II, treatments turned into “work therapy” for all those not residing in locked wards, or roughly 80% of the total patient population. Patients worked between two and eight hours a day on a variety of tasks, including baking, farming, sewing, gardening, cobbling, landscaping, housekeeping, cooking, and many others. After a day’s work, patients received either group or individual counseling; this counseling focused on correcting perceived moral or religious deficiencies, which were seen as the cause of a “demented” condition.
This period of hospital history (as in many other mental health facilities) is regarded as a low point, and even hospital officials have stated that it “must have been a frightening place through [those] decades.” Through the first five decades of the hospital’s history, the number of patients rose steadily, and most of them never left the hospital. Concerns were raised when so many patients were being admitted, and so few were being reintegrated into the community; the effectiveness of any treatment was cast into severe doubt.
Such concerns over the hospital’s retention rates of patients led to the next phase of treatment styles at the hospital, the “patient-is-problem” phase, from 1941 to 1954. Treatment began to incorporate Freudian theory of the causes of mental illness, and focused on an individual patient’s thought processes, formative experiences, and genetic factors. A significant factor in this approach came from returning WWII soldiers and medics, who had front line experience of mental trauma caused by war. On the front lines, these groups developed methods for first-response, short-term crisis therapy for those in distress to allow them to return to the battlefield. This interest in understanding mental illnesses increased as group therapies were found to be effective, and research by military medical personnel and social workers increased through both WWII and the Korean War (1951–1954).
The third reworking of hospital treatment policies began in the mid-1950s, ushered in by the new availability of psychotropic drugs. While some saw the new use of pills to treat mental illness as little more than “chemical strait jackets,” they allowed a large number of patients to be released and being their reintegration into the community. As the hospital’s 12th superintendent Dr. G. Lee Sandritter stated, “as long as we hang on to a patient, he won’t get well.” Thus, the new policy was for patients to be kept in the hospital only as long as medically necessary before being released and reintegrated. Sandritter was fired in his 2nd year amidst much controversy. The Spokesman Review had run a number of articles alleging misconduct at the hospital under his supervision, including runaways and sexual misconduct between staff and patients. It is unclear how much of these allegations were based in fact, and how many were generated by the hysteria over Sandritter’s loosening of hospital policies confining patients; the primary sources of the accusations were “disgruntled employees,” according to official hospital literature.
These liberalizing policies were continued by Sandritter’s successor, Dr. Harris Bunnell. A volunteer program was started to help integrate the hospital with the public, and in 1965 over 2400 visitors came to the hospital, helping to lessen the “asylum” stigma that had plagued it for so long. The patient population was also falling dramatically; by 1970, the hospital was at a quarter of its peak 1950s numbers at around 500 patients, a number not seen by the hospital since 1907. Treatment responsibilities for released patients were delegated to Community Mental Health centers, which were established locally under guidelines established by federal legislation.
This phase, which continues today, was catalyzed by new legislation in Congress. The Mental Health Study Act, passed by Congress in 1955, established the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Mental Health to evaluate mental health treatment in the United States. The commission’s recommendations for reforms were incorporated, in large part into the 1963 Community Mental Health Act. This act provided federal grants to state and municipal governments to establish community mental health centers to deal with outpatient treatment of the mentally ill.
Many were not accepting of the newly released mentally ill in their communities, and discrimination was fairly common and institutional: released patients could not vote nor hold driver’s licenses, despite having been declared “sane.” This changed in 1974, when the Washington State Legislature passed laws guaranteeing equal constitutional rights for patients. Treatment of the mentally ill today is increasingly done on an outpatient basis, and ESH focuses predominantly on more severe cases, as well as providing a space for group therapy and workshops. The hospital today has room for 312 patients, and has roughly 700 staff; nearly 100 patients are admitted on a monthly basis.[2]

Washington,Northern State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Northern_State_Hospital,1909,1911,"April 1, 1911",Closed,Cottage Plan,,Northern State Hospital for the Insane | Northern State Hospital for the Criminally Insane,"The institution was established in 1909 on a tract of land at Sedro-Woolley and was originally a farm for harmless patients under the direction of the superintendent of the Western Hospital at Fort Steilacoom. In 1911 the hospital was separated from the Western Hospital and quickly became the largest in the state. The new hospital opened April 1, 1911. Dr. A. H. McLeish was the first superintendent. He served until August 5, 1913 when he resigned and was succeeded by Dr. W. E. Cass. On February 1, 1914, Dr. Cass was succeeded by superintendent, Dr. J. W. Doughty, who was promoted from the position of first assistant physician at the Western Hospital for the Insane.
The hospital consisted of four cottages or ward buildings. They are two stories in height, with basement, of concrete construction, with tile roofs; strictly fireproof and arranged in accordance with the most modern and approved plans for hospital buildings of the time. Special attention was given to heating, lighting and ventilation, in order to afford the greatest degree of comfort to the patients. The kitchen building was of comprises several departments, including attendants' dining room, bakery, kitchen, refrigerating and store rooms.
A reinforced concrete tunnel, 5 feet 6 inches inside measurement, carried steam and electric lines from the power house to the patient buildings. A large amount of work was put into cleaning and cultivating additional land, building roads, grading, laying drains and sewers, cutting wood and repairing barns. Much of the construction work done up to 1914 was done with the assistance of patient labor. 
The population of the hospital on September 31, 1914, was 287, of which 94 were housed in temporary buildings.
The Legislature of 1913 appropriated $463,000 for additional buildings and land. Some of the new construction included an auditorium, commissary building, farm building, laundry, refrigeration plant, reservoir, sewage system, pathological laboratory, library, and construction of roads.[1]
Dr. James Winfield Doughty took charge on Jan. 13, 1914. At age 40 he had an impeccable medical record along with a reputation as a champion archer and a musician. While at Northern State, Doughty succeeded in implementing new ideas that were changing the often misguided and exploitative care of mental patients nationwide. During World War I he was chosen to serve on Governor Lister's state Medical Advisory Board along with legendary Dr. H.E. Cleveland of Burlington. Security became a concern during his term when the first murder of one patient by another occurred in February 1922.
During the '20s Doughty became a local fixture and, after the death of his wife in 1924, he became very active in Rotary, the Masonic lodge, the Odd Fellows lodge and the American Medical Association. He had grand plans for the hospital but they came to a screeching halt after the Crash of 1929. After Republican governor Roland Hartley was reelected in 1928 he decided to clean house at state institutions. Dr. Doughty finally got the ax in 1930 and he moved to King County where he set up private practice again.
Democrat Clarence D. Martin took office as governor in 1933 and in September of the next year Doughty was re-appointed at Northern State. He oversaw construction that had started and stopped in 1933 after building new wards, the last housing construction for 20 years. In 1936, as Washington began recovering from the Great Depression, he successfully pushed a program whereby voters authorized $200,000 in bonds for a clinical center. He maintained Northern State as the most modern of the three state institutions and instituted student nurse training on campus.
In a series of articles in 1953, the Courier-Times newspaper described the hospital in detail. At that time there were 2,200 patients; 415 employees, including 200 attendants; and 12 graduate nurses. The patients were housed in 33 wards and Jones was already telling the legislature that the buildings were filled to capacity. There were 13 other buildings in all. Patients were sent there from the eight northwestern counties: Skagit, Whatcom, Snohomish, King, Jefferson, San Juan, Clallam and Island.
Hospital closed in 1973 and now parts of the facility are used for Job Corps & also a Drug Rehab. The active buildings at Northern State are off-limits to members of the public, but much of the former property is now a part of Northern State Recreation Area.

Approximately 1,500 people are buried in the Northern State Cemetery while there is only one tombstone. Since the hospital closed, the grounds fell in to disrepair and many of the grave markers that identified the deceased patients by initials and number were removed or stolen. In recent years the grounds were funded for maintenance and some restoration, and around 100 of the original grave markers can be viewed at the site, including some of the oldest ones. A memorial plaque for those who died at Northern State Hospital was erected. Most records pertaining to burials were lost when the hospital closed. Cremated remains were buried at the cemetery, but they were not given grave markers.
A Mortuary / Crematorium was constructed in 1925 and was in use until about 1950, after which the hospital contracted with a local crematorium. The Mortuary / Crematorium at the hospital was left unused until is was demolished in the early 1990s.[2]
When NSH was closed, there were 204 containers of cremated remains stored in the attic of the Mortuary / Crematorium.  The unclaimed ashes were buried at Hawthorne cemetery in Mount Vernon.",1973,"Sedro-Woolley, WA",,
Washington,Tacoma State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tacoma_State_Hospital,1869,1870,1871,Active,Cottage Plan,,Western State Hospital | Fort Steilacoom Asylum | Tacoma State Insane Asylum | Insane Asylum of Washington Territory,"Western State Hospital is a psychiatric hospital located in Lakewood, Washington, which is a suburb of Tacoma. Administered by the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS), it is the largest mental facility west of the Mississippi River, with 806 beds, and the second oldest state-owned enterprise, after the University of Washington. One of two currently active, state-owned adult psychiatric hospitals, the other being Eastern State Hospital in Medical Lake. The hospital currently treats patients using psychiatric medications, mental health counseling, group therapy, drug and alcohol education, psychiatric rehabilitation and behavior modification therapies. It provides evaluation and inpatient treatment for individuals with serious or long-term mental illness that have been referred to the hospital through the Regional Support Network system and serves the needs of Western Washington for people who have been committed as a result of criminal proceedings.[1]
In accordance with an act of the Territorial Legislature, entitled ""An Act to Authorize the Purchase of the Government Buildings at Fort Steilacoom for an Insane Asylum,"" approved December 2. 1869, a Board of Commissioners, consisting of the Governor, Territorial Secretary and Territorial Auditor, purchased the buildings from the federal government on the 15th of January, 1870, for the sum of $850. Section 4 of this act provided that the buildings should be turned over to the commissioners for the care and custody of insane and idiotic persons, to be prepared and used by them as an insane asylum, at the expiration of the contract with Huntington & Sons on July 15, 1871.
In the meantime a contract was made by the territorial authorities with Hill Harmon, of Olympia, to clothe and to keep the insane for a period of five years, dating from August 19, 1871, at 91 cents per diem. After the necessary alterations of the buildings to adapt them to the purpose intended had been made 21 patients were transferred from Monticello on August 19, 1871, and Fort Steilacoom was formally opened as an insane asylum. Dr. Stacy Hemenway was appointed by the commissioners as resident physician.
From a report of the contractor to the Governor of Washington Territory, dated September 30, 1871, it was learned that the asylum building was 152 feet long and 54 feet wide, and was divided into two wards, one for males and one for females. The male ward was 96 feet long and 44 feet wide, containing a central hall and 20 rooms, 10 on each side. Under the same roof was a bathroom supplied with hot and cold water, a water closet and wardrobe. The central hall was 96 feet long and 14 feet wide, having one large window at each end and two skylights. On each side of this hall were 10 rooms, each 18 feet in length by 9 feet in width. These rooms, together with the central hall, accommodated about 40 patients.
The female ward was 56 feet long and 44 feet wide, with a central hall and 10 rooms, five on each side. Attached to it was a bathroom similar to that on the male ward. The central hall was 56 feet long and 14 feet wide, having five rooms on each side, 18 feet in length by 9 feet in width. These rooms, together with the central hall, accommodated about 20 patients.
All windows in the building were secured by iron rods. On the north side was a porch 128 feet long and 10 feet wide, enclosed by lattice-work. At the east end of the building was an airing court, containing about two-thirds of an acre and enclosed by a board fence 14 feet high. The building was heated by two large box stoves, with sheet-iron drums attached, one in the male ward and one in the female ward. The building containing the kitchen and dining room was 60 feet long and 32 feet wide, and was joined to the central building, forming a south wing. There were separate dining rooms for male and female patients, respectively, and a small room for the superintendent and employees. The water supply was obtained from a spring 2000 feet distant from the asylum, being forced by a ram to a brick tank with a capacity of 6000 gallons. The total number of patients on October 1, 1871, was 23.
According to the terms of his contract the contractor was required simply to clothe and keep the insane, and the physician was supposed to have full supervision and control over the medical, moral and sanitary management of the establishment. This dual system soon led to trouble during Dr. Hemenway's term of service, and his successor, Dr. H. C. Willison, was compelled to resign in turn by reason of the deplorable conditions he found prevailing, and which, under the terms of his contract, he was powerless to remedy. He was succeeded by Dr. Ballard, of Oregon.
Conditions finally became such that the members of the Medical Society of Washington Territory undertook, in 1875, to remedy affairs and appointed an investigating committee to look into the charges of ill treatment and report their findings. The committee's report was published in pamphlet form in Olympia in 1875.
Dr. Ballard was succeeded as superintendent by Dr. F. S. Sparling, who served until June 1, 1877, when he was succeeded by Dr. Rufus Willard. From Dr. Willard's report, dated October 1, 1877, it seems that the old system of awarding the contract for the keeping of the insane of the territory had at last been done away with, and that the medical superintendent was in complete charge of the institution, with territorial appropriations for its maintenance. At that time there were 93 patients under treatment.
The report for 1883 of Dr. John W. Waughop, superintendent, shows 129 patients in the asylum, at a per capita cost per week of $4-34. Various improvements are noted, among them being an assembly room and chapel, 30 feet by 40 feet; a turbine wheel and two force pumps to increase the water supply; new drainage; a number of trees planted, and a flower garden for the female ward. The farm consisted of 600 acres, and the institution was supplied with milk by its own herd of cows. A number of hogs and chickens were raised each year. Patients assisted in the farm and garden work, in the wards, laundry, kitchen, bakery, carpenter shop, tin shop, blacksmith's shop, etc.
On April 1, 1897, Dr. F. L. Goddard was appointed superintendent, succeeding Dr. J. W. Waughop. In 1900 the number of patients had risen to 694, and the hospital had become, by successive additions, a large and progressive institution. The old buildings had been replaced by brick buildings of an up-to-date character, with the necessary appurtenances of a modern hospital for the insane. An additional wing, with accommodations for about 100 male patients, was erected, and occupied on March 1, 1900, at a cost of $40,000. A new ice machine was installed, and the boiler plant and bathing apparatus remodeled.
In March, 1902, Dr. F. L. Goddard was succeeded as superintendent by Dr. C. M. Parks. He in turn was succeeded in 1904 by Dr. A. H. McLeish. In 1904 the Legislature appropriated $101,000 for two separate ward buildings, with a capacity of 140 patients each. They are of brick, fireproof, well ventilated and sanitary in every respect. In 1905 the board purchased 93 acres of land adjoining the hospital grounds on the west to be used as additional pasture land.
In 1907 Dr. A. P. Calhoun was superintendent in place of Dr. A. H. McLeish. In 1913 the average daily population was 1440 patients, and the cost of their maintenance was 45 cents per day per capita. The state appropriation for the ensuing biennial period amounted to $577,690.
The hospital has a complete hydrotherapeutic plant and separate cottages for tubercular patients. Patients are employed as much as possible and amusements are many and varied, such as baseball, dancing, amateur theatricals, band music, walks, drives and indoor games. The main buildings are on the congregate plan, with extended wings: are built of brick, and are pleasing in appearance.[2]
In 2009 the patient population was 809.[3]

Prior to 1906 the only facility for the ""feeble minded"" was the School for Defective Youth in Vancouver, established in 1892.
Female residents moved to the new site in February 1917. The Population increased to 620 by 1918 and reached an all-time high of 1654 in 1938. The farm operation produced all vegetables, grain and ensilage used by the institution, 60% of the eggs, all pork, all  milk and cream.
In 1939 Western State Custodial School was built on the west side of Washington. The state was then divided geographically and Lakeland was renamed Eastern State Custodial School. The change in name to Lakeland Village occurred in 1947.
The facility has undergone many changes both physically and philosophically through the years.  Old dormitory style buildings were remodeled several times and then finally replaced with smaller cottage style homes. The population has decreased to 259 (February 2001). The purpose of the facility has changed from care and custody for the ""the happiness of children"" to providing active treatment for habilitation to an adult population.",,"Medical Lake, WA",,

The campus is situated in a peaceful country setting with a unique and prominent view of Mount Rainier.
In 1939, Washington State opened the Western State Custodial School in the small town of Buckley. The site provided 1,265 acres, ample land for the housing and self-sufficient dairy farm to come. Promise of spacious grounds drew many needy families to the new facility. The public image of the institution was a departure from large-scale hospital ward life, promising outdoor activities, exercises and classes. Rainier School's first residents arrived in October 1939 from what is now known as Lakeland Village. Then named Western State Custodial School, Rainier School was the only such facility in Western Washington. The facility was renamed Rainier State School in 1947 and then Rainier School in 1956. Resident population peaked in 1958 at 1,918.
Today, Rainier School's population is about 370 adults with a wide variety of abilities and needs. 24-hour residential care and specialized care or teaching is provided in the areas of work or vocational training, leisure activities, social relationships, and everyday life tasks. Programs and services are individualized and designed to enhance self-determination and maximize independence.

Washington,Veterans Hospital American Lake,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Veterans_Hospital_American_Lake,1923,,1924,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"The American Lake campus began in 1923 as the 94th Veterans Hospital to be built by the War Department for the provision of care to World War I Veterans. The Secretary of the Army authorized, under a revocable license, the Veteran Bureau's use of 377 acres of the 87,000 acre Fort Lewis property. The Hurley-Mason Company was awarded contracts for the construction of the facility and work was soon started on Veterans Hospital Number 94.
A site chosen on the western shores of American Lake soon became home for the new buildings of Spanish American architecture. Many of the stucco and terra cotta buildings are listed on the National Register of Historical Buildings, and are still enjoyed by both patients and staff for their esthetic beauty.
The medical center was dedicated in 1924 and chartered with a single mission - neuro-psychiatric treatment. On March 15, 1924, the first 50 patients were admitted to the hospital, by transfer, from Western State Hospital at Fort Steilacoom.
Over the years, American Lake grew from its original mission of a neuro-psychiatric facility, to a multi-care facility. In the 1960's and 1970's Ambulatory Surgical Services, a 76-bed Nursing Home Unit, Blind Rehabilitation Services, a Substance Abuse Treatment Program, and a 60-bed homeless Domiciliary were added to expand the scope of care to Veterans.
In the 1980's and 1990's, additional special programs such as Vocational Rehabilitation, a Residential Care Program, and a Post Traumatic Stress Treatment Program were added. In 1998, Building 81 was renovated and an addition added that allowed for relocation and expansion of Primary Care Services and a Women's Health Clinic.",,"Tacoma, WA",,

At that time, the facility was renamed Yakima Valley School (YVS). In 1978 the facility was accredited as an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and programming was expanded to include education and pre-employment vocational training programs.
Yakima Valley School was designated a Nursing Facility in 1994. Currently, about 260 direct care and support staff provide 24-hour nursing care, a full spectrum of clinical and therapeutic programs, and recreation/activities to about 108 individuals who reside in 15 separate homes on campus.",,"Selah, WA",,

Washington,Firland Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Firland_Sanatorium,1908,,1911,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Henry Sanatorium,"Firland Sanatorium, Seattle’s municipal tuberculosis hospital, opened on May 2, 1911, to help combat what was at the time Seattle’s leading cause of death. Firland was located on 34 acres in the Richmond Highlands area, 12 miles north of the then-border of Seattle (in 1995 this first Firland site became part of the newly incorporated City of Shoreline). The hospital served there until its move to a former Naval hospital (at 15th Avenue NE and 150th Street) in 1947, and continued to treat TB patients until its dissolution in 1973. A leading founder of Firland Sanatorium was the railroad magnate Horace C. Henry (1844-1928), whose son Walter had died of TB.
In 1908, the U.S. Office of Public Health had declared Seattle’s record of fighting tuberculosis to be the worst in the country. In 1909, a group of leading citizens, including Horace Henry, formed the Anti-Tuberculosis League of King County to combat it. A member of the League, J. V. Smith, declared that the city of Seattle was a tuberculosis camp. The League engaged a team of visiting nurses to bring TB sufferers to its attention, and uncovered at least 1,000 cases. In Seattle, the first attempt to set up a sanatorium on Queen Anne Hill met with neighborhood outrage, expressed by threats and waving broomsticks, at the idea of a resident ""pesthouse."" League president Horace Henry stepped forward with a donation of 34 acres of land 12 miles north of the (then) Seattle city limits in the Richmond Highlands area, along with $25,000 seed money. Firland was established on land bordered (2002) by Fremont Avenue N on the east, Palatine Avenue on the west, 195th Street on the north and 190th Street on the south. Seattle voters passed a $10,000 bond issue in the spring of 1910 to aid in construction costs. Dr. Robert M. Stith (1874-1943), whose mother had died of tuberculosis, was appointed Medical Director, a position he would hold until his death.
On May 2, 1911, the Henry Sanatorium accepted its first patients. They were housed in open-air cottages. Nursing staff was initially forced to sleep on the floor, since the only non-patient areas of the facility had no beds. Since no paved road connected Seattle and the hospital compound, supplies were sent via the Interurban trolley. From the trolley station at Richmond Highlands, they were transported by wheelbarrow to the Sanatorium. By 1913 the North Trunk Road, now Aurora Avenue N, was paved with bricks at the insistence of physicians so that they and patients’ families could have more ready access. Eventually, buses served Firland on the half-hour.
On July 13, 1913, ground was broken for the English Tudor-style Administration Building, also known as the Walter H. Henry Memorial Building. The Hospital Building, known as the Detweiler Building, and Jenner Hall were also built in 1913. Jenner Hall housed patients with non-tubercular infectious diseases. Although it was outside Firland’s scope, city health officials felt that having this municipal isolation hospital share Firland’s administrative staff would save money.
In 1920 the Koch and Nightingale buildings were completed and housed ambulant patients. A temporary structure built in 1913 to house children with TB (or with infected family members) was replaced in 1925 with a permanent facility, Josef House, named in honor of a deceased patient whose small financial legacy to Firland was used to furnish the facility. All buildings featured gentle ramps between levels rather than stairs, in order that ambulant patients not over-exert themselves, and were connected by underground tunnels. Large vegetable gardens and orchards served the facility. A power generating plant and a well rendered the sanatorium self-sufficient, although Firland was eventually served by the municipal water supply. Over the years more buildings were erected, among them a laboratory and a recreational/occupational therapy facility.
The tools with which Firland’s medical staff could forge a tubercular patient’s cure were extremely limited. “Rest -- more rest -- and still more rest. Rest is the keynote. Rest for the body, rest for the mind. Rest from involuntary as well as voluntary activity forms the basis on which the cure is built” (Firland, 31). (Rest is no longer seen as particularly curative for TB.)  Fresh air was considered essential in the cure of TB, and screened windows were kept wide open year-round. Nourishing food was plentiful, and patients were expected to eat well to build their strength. Visiting hours were Thursdays and Sundays from 2-4. Patients were allowed three (adult) visitors only. Some patients were treated surgically, by injecting air into the space surrounding each lung (artificial pneumothorax) or by removing ribs so the chest wall sank in on the underlying lung (thoracoplasty). Both techniques were designed to keep the lungs more still. Because tubercular lungs could not be subjected to general anesthesia, this thoracic surgery was performed under local anesthesia using Novocain or sodium pentothal.
The rooms in the Detweiler Building, where patients were the sickest, were divided by partitions that ended about a foot off the floor rather than by walls. The patients’ sense of each other was immediate and intense, since a bed against one side of a partition was only inches from the bed on the other side. Patients were housed two or four to a room. In the stillness of the resting ward, patients could hear each other cough, turn over, and even breathe. Pulmonary hemorrhages and nurses’ response to them could be heard throughout the ward. Patients in the final stages of the disease were moved into a single room close to the nurses’ station. Everyone knew that tuberculosis was often fatal. Death seemed to stalk among them: “Up and down the halls he went, never hurrying, knowing that we’d wait for him” (MacDonald, 161).
Tuberculosis in children was usually an infection of the lymph nodes rather than the lungs, and was considered easier to cure under the proper conditions. Josef House, the juvenile tuberculosis facility at Firland, took patients from birth to age 15. Some patients had tuberculosis, while some were treated prophylactically as they came from homes (often low-income) where a family member had TB. Some of the children’s mothers were undergoing treatment at Firland and were therefore unable to care for their children. For these women, Josef House was a godsend. Children underwent a period of complete bed rest similar to that of adult patients, although usually of a shorter duration. The children wore minimal clothing year-round, indoors and out: light cotton shorts/trunks, hat, socks, and shoes. Older girls wore blouses. Josef House had a schoolroom, where the children were tutored and instructed in health and hygiene. When necessary, children were tutored at bedside. Birthdays were always celebrated with cake and candles. Supervised play, handwork, seasonal celebrations, picnics, and a large wading pool offered diversions from the business of resting, child-style. Josef House had beds for 40-50 children.
Patients who successfully demonstrated that their tuberculosis was arrested and their strength regained were ready for discharge, again at the discretion of Medical Director Stith. Departing patients were cautioned to continue getting as much rest as possible, to return regularly to the Firland Clinic for checkups, to consult with their doctor when considering type of employment, and to remain on vigilant watch for the return of any tuberculosis symptoms. Women were cautioned against becoming pregnant. The National Tuberculosis Association found that Firland had a higher incidence of patients living a normal life five years following discharge than any other sanatorium in the country.
During World War II (1942-1945) Firland’s nursing staff, siphoned off to help with the war effort, was reduced to one-third of its pre-war level. Ragnar Westman, Seattle’s Commissioner of Health, considered Firland “barely operable” under such conditions (Westman, 146). Firland’s diagnostic case finding program was suspended due to lack of staff and funding. Firland patients in occupational therapy participated in a U.S. Navy program to produce scale-model aircraft for use as a teaching tool to train plane spotters to identify American and enemy planes. Patients with ""time up"" also knit for the war effort.
Admission, discharge, and birthday listings in wartime issues of PEP suggest that there was no mass discharge of patients of Japanese descent due to Executive Order 9066 (which forced West Coast people of Japanese descent into internment camps). Three patients with Japanese surnames were discharged in April 1942, one mid-war (possibly a death), and then no others until June 1945. Japanese names continued to appear on the monthly birthday list and on PEP’s masthead throughout the war. Throughout the war, Quaker peace activists Floyd and Ruth Schmoe visited the Japanese patients, whose families had been interned at Camp Minidoka (Roger Daniels, 117).
In 1943 King County assumed responsibility for Firland, and on November 25, 1947, patients from Firland and the former King County tuberculosis sanatoria, Morningside and Meadows, were ferried by ambulances to the ""new"" Firland, a decommissioned Naval Hospital at 15th Avenue NE and 150th Street. This operation was termed “the greatest mass movement of patients from one tuberculosis sanatorium to another in the history of any United States civilian hospital” (Lerner, 44). The new Medical Director was Dr. Roberts Davies. The new facility had 1350 beds. The increased number of available beds meant that the entire waiting list could be admitted. For the first time in Firland’s history, anyone who needed a bed at Firland could be admitted. Many Seattleites decried the bunker-like facility, which had been intended for temporary use during the war and constructed accordingly. A wire fence surrounded the compound.
In any case, the Rest Cure was about to be supplanted: in 1947 Firland physicians gained access to the newly invented antibiotic wonder drugs. Streptomycin, followed by Para-amino Salicylic acid (PAS) and isoniazid, were used in combination to successfully combat tuberculosis. Firland physicians, mindful of the tubercle bacilli’s demonstrable ability to quickly become resistant to antibiotics, continued to stress rest and good nutrition as important components of the Cure. By 1954, the average time a patient spent at Firland had been cut in half. Mortality rates at Firland plummeted from 31 percent in 1948 to 6 percent in 1954. In 1957, a team of national officials evaluated Firland and proclaimed it one of the most outstanding sanatoria in the country. A 1948 affiliation with the University of Washington Medical School funneled a steady supply of medical students, nursing students, and resident physicians through Firland. This in turn attracted excellent medical personnel from around the country to Firland’s staff.
During the 1950s, Firland medical sociologist Joan K. Jackson addressed the problems of treating tuberculosis in alcoholics. A Firland chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous was founded in 1950. Concurrent to rehabilitation, however, Firland began to forcibly isolate alcoholics in order to prevent patients from leaving the institution against medical advice.  “Known as Ward Six and located in the old naval brig … it was equipped with both locked doors and heavily screened windows. Included on the ward were seven locked cells, which contained only concrete slabs covered by thin mattresses. Patients admitted to Ward Six (most of whom were intoxicated) spent the first twenty-four hours in one of these cells for the purpose of sobering up or delousing” (Lerner, 121).
At first it was used sparingly, but by the mid-1950s fully 10 percent of Firland’s patients were involuntarily detained. Alcoholic patients who failed to adhere to antibiotic therapy after being discharged were often readmitted and operated upon prophylactically (with their consent, but in a manner generally thought to constitute overtreatment of the disease) and given a mandatory one year stay at Firland despite a negative sputum culture which would in a non-alcoholic patient have stimulated discharge. Detention at Firland took place without formal legal process, although within Health Department quarantine regulations in accordance with state laws passed in 1903 and 1907, previously unenforced due to lack of available beds.
""Difficult"" patients were also placed on Ward Six in an attempt to maintain order, and as punishment for breaking rules. Firland staff wrote articles for medical journals detailing the use of Ward Six, and directors of sanatoria around the country traveled to Seattle to see it in action. In 1957, the Washington American Civil Liberties Union investigated Firland, but it was not until 1965, when District Court Judge Robert M. Elston began to hold monthly hearings addressing the needs of Ward Six inmates, that a system of due process was instituted. Still, in 1971, when the state of Washington assumed financial responsibility for Firland, one-third of Firland’s patients were under quarantine orders.
On October 30, 1973, Firland closed its doors. Washington had decided to consolidate the state’s tuberculosis treatment centers, and Firland’s 210 remaining patients were transferred to Mountain View Hospital in Tacoma. National trends encouraged integrating TB patients into mainstream hospitals, with most receiving outpatient antibiotic treatment under the supervision of private physicians or the Department of Health. The era of tubercular sanatoria, in which Firland had played such a crucial role for Seattle, was over. The area that was once the sanatorium has since been redeveloped and only a few traces remain.
