Minnesota,Anoka State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Anoka_State_Hospital,,,1900,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Anoka State Asylum | Anoka-Metro Regional Treatment Center,"Anoka-Metro Regional Treatment Center is the current name of what was originally the First State Asylum for the Insane (1900-1919), Anoka State Asylum (1919-1937), and Anoka State Hospital (1937-1985). The first 100 patients arrived at the newly opened Anoka Asylum in March 1900. The group of men who traveled by train from the St. Peter hospital were classified as “incurables.” The asylum was not built originally as a place for treatment. Rather it was where most of these men would live out their days. According to historical records, 86 of those first 100 patients died there and many were buried in numbered graves at the cemetery on the grounds.
By 1906, 115 female patients had been transferred to the hospital from the facility in St. Peter. In 1909, it was decided that Anoka would admit only female transfer patients and that the state hospital in Hastings would admit the male transfer patients. However, construction of an additional building in 1925 allowed the hospital once again to admit male patients.
As treatment of the mentally ill evolved, so did conditions and treatment at Anoka. Among the procedures performed in the 1940s and ’50s were lobotomies, some done at the University of Minnesota. In the 1950s, treatments included electroshock therapy and hydrotherapy. In 1948, Gov. Luther Youngdahl allowed a reporter and a photographer from the Minneapolis Tribune to tour the state’s seven hospitals, including Anoka. The articles that followed exposed harsh conditions. In 1949, Youngdahl visited the Anoka hospital on Halloween night and, using a torch, burned hundreds of leather restraints and straitjackets in front of a crowd of more than 1,000. In a speech, the governor said the burning “liberated patients from barbarous devices and the approach which these devices symbolized,” according to historical accounts. Youngdahl moved to improve funding and conditions in the state’s hospitals.
An infirmary and clinic are provided for the physical health care of all residents at the hospital. Any previous programs, a treatment center for the mentally ill with tuberculosis (1948-1967) as well as programs for emotionally disturbed children and adolescents (1970s), have been discontinued. “Deinstitutionalization” of the mentally ill starting in the 1960s also ushered in an era of change across the nation. At the Anoka center, the number of patients dropped from 1,085 in 1960 to 476 by 1970 as the state invested in community-based care.
A shocking event occurred in 1976, when a patient escaped hospital grounds, broke into a nearby home and killed homeowner Mary Galbraith. At packed community meetings, there were demands ranging from better security at the hospital to closing it. Compromises were reached and the hospital remained open. City police took over security in 1986. After the hospital was closed in 1999, the state gave the historic campus to Anoka County, which now uses several of the buildings to house human services offices and the county workhouse. Several of the older buildings are mothballed. The current facility, Anoka-Metro Regional Treatment Center, is located to the original Anoka State Hospital campus.  Volunteers renovated three of the empty cottages into housing for veterans in 2017, and a fourth in 2019. As of 2020, the Anoka County department of corrections continues to use the remaining buildings.
The following thirty-minute video on the history of Anoka State Hospital was created by QCTV and Matt Overstreet.
Through the efforts of the advocacy group, a large number of headstones were initially placed which included the person's name. The hospital records indicate 400 people were buried in the cemetery from the time it opened in 1900 until the last burial in 1965. In October 2008 the advocacy group Remembering With Dignity and the Anoka Metro Regional Treatment Center hosted a special service at the cemetery site. The project was completed in 2009 and now each person has a proper marker and dignified place of rest.",1999 (Original campus),"Anoka, MN",,
Minnesota,Fergus Falls State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fergus_Falls_State_Hospital,1887,1888,"July 29, 1890",Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Warren B. Dunnell,Third Minnesota State Hospital for the Insane | Fergus Falls Regional Treatment Center (RTC),"In 1885, the two existing state hospitals for the insane of Minnesota being overcrowded with patients, it became necessary to take steps for the erection of a third institution. Consequently the Legislature of 1885 passed an act to establish a commission to locate a third hospital for the insane and prepare plans for its construction. This act authorized and required the Governor to appoint a commission to consist of five persons, who should locate a site for said hospital at some point in the northern part of the state, cause plans to be made, and present an estimate of the cost under said plans. The act was approved by the Governor, Lucius F. Hubbard, on March 2, and shortly afterwards he appointed R. B. Langdon, of Minneapolis; C. K. Bartlett, superintendent of the St. Peter Hospital; H. H. Hart, of St. Paul, secretary of the Board By G. O. Welch, M. D., superintendent of Corrections and Charities; H. G. Stordeck, of Breckenridge, and F. S. Christensen, of Rush City, as members of the commission. The commission looked over the various sites suggested and finally selected one in the northern part of the City of Fergus Falls. An estimate was prepared covering the cost of land and the erection of ward buildings for 300 patients, with boiler house, laundry, etc. The report and recommendations of the commission were laid before the Legislature of 1887 and that body passed an act locating and establishing a third hospital for the insane at the City of Fergus Falls and placing the institution under the charge and control of the Board of Trustees for the insane of Minnesota. Later in the session an appropriation of $24,280 was made for the purchase of 596 acres of land, and $70,000 for the buildings recommended by the commission.
As soon as it was known that a new institution for the insane was contemplated the homeopathic physicians of the state, believing that their school deserved some recognition, took active steps to secure the proposed hospital. As a result of their efforts the Legislature of 1887 passed the following act:
That the superintendent and corps of physicians appointed for the third hospital for the insane, located at Fergus Falls, shall be of the school of homoeopathy, and the Board of Trustees of the hospitals for the insane of Minnesota are hereby directed to make appointments in accordance herewith as soon as the hospital is ready for patients.
Shortly after the Board of Trustees took control of the affairs of the new hospital Warren B. Dunnell, of Minneapolis, was appointed architect. During the fall of 1887 he visited many of the Eastern hospitals and on his return plans were prepared for the new institution, upon which work was begun in 1888. The ward buildings are of the congregate plan, with a main wing 430 feet long, and a detached wing 200 feet long for each sex. The buildings are three stories high, with a finished attic; they are built of cream brick with sandstone trimmings and a slate roof; are of fireproof construction, and are of pleasing and artistic appearance.
There was considerable delay in completing the first buildings contracted for, as the money appropriated was not sufficient for the purpose. The Legislature of 1889 made an additional appropriation of $65,000 and the first ward building was at length ready for occupancy. On July 29, 1890, the hospital was declared open and on the 30th 90 men were transferred thereto from the St. Peter State Hospital.
Since the opening of the hospital each succeeding Legislature, realizing the necessity of relieving the overcrowded condition of the other institutions for the insane, has been very generous in its appropriations. The ward buildings proper and all the outside buildings as contemplated in the original plans were completed in 1899. Since then the farm acreage has been largely increased, several new buildings have been erected, some of the older ones have been enlarged in order that they may be better adapted to the purposes for which they were intended, and many improvements have been made in various parts of the plant in order to bring it up to the highest state of efficiency.
The total cost of the plant up to the present time has been approximately $1,252,000, divided as follows: Land (1075.61 acres), $51,365; ward buildings, $750,000; administration building, $57,000; kitchen and storeroom buildings, $91,000; heating and lighting plant, $90,000; barns and live stock, $30,500; laundry, $32,000; water supply, $12,000; nurses' home, $80,000; amusement hall and congregate dining room, $32,000; shops, $8500; library, $1000; subways, $5000; improvement of grounds, $4500; electric and surgical apparatus, $5000; fire alarm system, $2000.
In September, 1887, the Board of Trustees appointed Captain O. C. Chase, of Fergus Falls, as general overseer of the work. In February, 1890, Captain Chase was appointed to the position of steward, which office he has held since that time, having proved himself a faithful and efficient officer.
During the spring of 1890 the Board of Trustees selected Dr. Alonza P. Williamson as superintendent, and he took charge of the institution on the 4th of May. Dr. Williamson was a graduate of the Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia. After graduation he served for a time at Ward's Island, New York, and afterwards accepted a position at the Middletown State Hospital, New York, where he served for a number of years as assistant superintendent. Coming to the new hospital in Minnesota in its infancy, he was instrumental in establishing the work upon a solid foundation, to which much of its future success was due. Dr. Williamson resigned his position on November 9, 1892, and opened an office in Minneapolis, devoting himself to special work in mental and nervous diseases. On the day of his resignation Dr. George O. Welch was appointed superintendent. Dr. Welch was a native of Massachusetts and a graduate of the Boston University. In June, 1887, he was appointed to a position on the staff of the Westborough State Hospital of Massachusetts and resigned that position in February, 1892, to take a post-graduate course in mental and nervous diseases in Europe. While abroad he was appointed to the position of superintendent at the Fergus Falls State Hospital, which position he has held since that time.
As soon as the institution was ready for patients the Board of Trustees divided the state into three hospital districts. The Fergus Falls district includes practically all of the state north of the City of Minneapolis, a much larger area than the other two districts combined, but not nearly so thickly populated. As the state is growing fast, the hospital is beginning to suffer from the usual overcrowded condition, having now (1912) a population of 1650 patients, with a normal capacity of 1500. Since the opening of the hospital over 8000 patients have been admitted. The results of treatment have been very satisfactory, a large proportion of the recently admitted cases being sent out each year in a normal mental condition.
A training school for nurses was organized in 1894. The two years' course at first required by the school was later changed to three. The school has always been open to both sexes, but entrance therein has never been obligatory. Since the opening of the school 103 men and 114 women have been graduated. The school has helped materially to raise the standard of efficiency among the nursing force, and many of the graduates now hold responsible hospital positions elsewhere.
The following named gentlemen served upon the Board of Trustees from the opening of the hospital until 1901, when all institutions were placed under the Board of Control: A. L. Sackett, J. F. Meagher, A. Barto, M. R. Tyler, C. D. Wright, A. T. Stebbins, Dr. J. F. Fulton, John Peterson, J. W. Mason, T. H. Titus, Dr. W. A. Jones, R. A. Smith, J. H. Block, Dr. C. L. Wells, T. D.

The institution served 17 counties in northwestern and west central Minnesota with the patient census reaching an all-time high of 2,078 in 1937. The regional treatment center was one of the first multipurpose campuses, serving those with developmental disabilities, chemical dependency as well as psychiatric illnesses.[4] The kirkbride building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[5] During the 1980s, 90s, and into 2000 the hospital population decreased as patients were placed in smaller community based facilities. In 2007 the campus buildings were sold to the City of Fergus Falls.[6] In 2009 a lighting strike on the administration section cause a fire to break out in the center steeple. Fire crews responded and prevented the fire from spreading further down into the admin but were criticized by some for their slow response time.[7] The city has since placed a ""cap"" on top of the steeple. On August 30th, 2010 the city listed the former hospital campus for sale on Craigslist for $1. The ad stated that any potential buyers must have ""a plan for development and proof of private development capital"".[8] In the first half of 2011 the city of Fergus Falls proposed a phased demolition of many of the non-historical structures. In the initial version of this plan the Kirkbride building would not be demolished, only the cafeteria, gymnasium, administrative building, and some other outbuildings behind the Kirkbride, as well as several tunnels connecting the buildings would be demolished. The demolition plan has a tentative start date of summer 2012 unless a developer steps in and purchases the property.[9]",2007,"Fergus Falls, MN",,"2,078 in 1937"
Minnesota,Hastings State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hastings_State_Hospital,1899,1900,1901,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Hastings Asylum for the Insane | Second State Asylum for the Insane | Hastings State Asylum,"Hastings State Hospital was established by an act of the legislature (Laws 1899 c230) as the Second State Asylum for the Insane. The site of Hastings, Minnesota was chosen. At its opening in 1900, it served as a transfer asylum, admitting patients from other state hospitals. It did not admit women until 1944 except for four years staring in 1905. The hospital's name was changed to Hastings State Asylum in 1919 and to Hastings State Hospital in 1937. Hastings State Hospital was closed on May 1st, 1978. All patients were either transferred or discharged to homes or other state hospitals or facilities. The second state veterans home was established on the site of the hospital.
Hastings State Hospital was the first in the state to discontinue use of physical restraints fro mentally ill patients, to implement regional coordination, and to open a regional service for drug dependency. It was also one of the leading hospitals in terms of developing partial hospitalization, adolescent treatment services, and education programs. At its closing, it was also one of the first hospitals to offer benefits for its' workers. All employees were offered employment in the Department of Public Welfare or other state agencies with no loss of salary or benefits. Hastings State Hospital was closed on May 1st, 1978. All patients were either transferred or discharged to homes or other state hospitals or facilities. The second state veterans home was established on the site of the hospital.
Hastings State Hospital was one of the two original state asylums in Minnesota. Its architectural organization was according to the cottage plan, which allowed for a cozier, more ""home-like"" atmosphere for the patients. Many of these buildings are examples of the Tudor Revival style and are more ornate than the plain brick buildings at Anoka.

The commission selected land adjacent to the village of Moose Lake in Carlton County. The legislature, at its special session of 1935-1936, confirmed the location and directed the State Board of Control to purchase the land and proceed with construction of building (Laws Ex. Sess. 1935, c5, sl-12).
Construction began in November 1936, and the hospital accepted its first patients, transfers from the Fergus Falls and St. Peter state hospitals, on May 2, 1938. The formal opening was held on June 11. The first patients directly admitted from the probate courts arrived at the hospital on August 15, 1938. In 1949 two buildings for male and female geriatric patients and a combination auditorium, library, and occupational therapy building were constructed.
Moose Lake State Hospital, the fourth hospital for the insane in Minnesota, was built as a public works administration project in 1936-1938. Massive brick buildings created a rather somber interpretation of the Colonial Revival style which was certainly affected by the Depression. The hospital was designed to be an independent community, with administration, medical center, receiving wards for men and women, kitchen, bakery, laundry, powerhouse and sewage disposal units, four dormitories for patients, a nurses’ home, and a superintendent’s residence. Early treatments used at the hospital included insulin and electroshock, hydrotherapy, and physiotherapy. In the 1950s lobotomies were used on some patients. In 1959, when the Sandstone State Hospital closed, its alcoholic program was transferred to Moose Lake. By 1961, treatment of alcoholism was a specialization of Moose Lake. In 1966 a program for adolescents was begun, in which some of the participants attended public school and gained high school credits. Also in 1966 all of the hospital’s medical/surgical wards were closed. In 1972 the hospital began a long term chemical dependency program and in 1984 implemented a collaborative inpatient/outpatient chemical dependency program in conjunction with the Northland Mental Health Center in Grand Rapids.
With the closing of the Rochester State Hospital in 1982, Moose Lake received fifty patients, and began development of a specialized geriatric (psycho-geriatric) program.
By the 1980s the hospital had four active programs serving either all of or parts of thirteen counties: St. Louis, Cook, Lake, Koochiching, Itasca, Ramsey, Washington, Chisago, Isanti, Kanabec, Mille Lacs, and Pine. The four programs were mental retardation service, which served only St. Louis, Carlton, Cook, and Lake counties; chemical dependency service, which served all thirteen counties; mental illness service, which served all thirteen counties except Ramsey and Washington; and psycho-geriatric service, which provided service statewide.
The hospital closed as a psychiatric facility in 1995. It has since been owned and operated by the Minnesota Department of Corrections and is now called the Minnesota Correctional Facility - Moose Lake. Since becoming a prison, two living units and an industry building have been added to the campus, and the facility maintains a small treatment unit for drug/alcohol problems, as well as a sex offender treatment program. There are currently around 1000 inmates incarcerated at MCF-Moose Lake.",1995 (as psychiatric facility),"Moose Lake, MN",,"1,290 in 1955"
Minnesota,Rochester State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rochester_State_Hospital,1878,1877,January 1879,Closed,Kirkbride Plan,,Second Minnesota Hospital for the Insane,"By a special law passed by the Legislature of 1873 and amended in 1874 a tax of $10 on all liquor dealers was assessed to raise a fund for the establishment of a state inebriate asylum which, when completed, was to be maintained by a continuation of the same tax. As soon as a sufficient fund was accumulated the Inebriate Asylum Board purchased a farm of 160 acres, within a mile and a half of the City of Rochester, for $9000, secured plans and began building in 1877. Strong opposition was raised by liquor dealers against this tax as discriminating and unjust. Test cases were tried in the courts and the constitutionality of the law was sustained. At the same time it became apparent and was admitted generally that additional room was much more urgently needed for the care of the rapidly increasing insane of the state than for the care of inebriates. The Legislature of 1878, in view of this and of the determined opposition to an inebriate asylum to be built and maintained on such a plan, repealed the act levying the tax and changed the inebriate asylum to the Second Minnesota Hospital for Insane, which title was later changed to the Rochester State Hospital (in 1883), with the proviso, however, that inebriates should be admitted and cared for and treated at the expense of the state on the same basis as the insane. Accordingly a separate ward was maintained for inebriates until the department was abolished by the Legislature in 1897.
The building was in an unfinished condition, and consisted of a center and small east wing, then only under roof, without inside finish, and without outbuildings, such as laundry and engine house. When the trustees examined the property they recognized its unfitness for the purposes of an insane hospital and the fact that it would necessarily require many changes to adapt it to this new use. Owing to these objections they hesitated to accept the transfer; but the urgency for room was so great they reluctantly concluded to do the best they could with it. An appropriation of $15,000 accompanied the transfer as a fund to be used to prepare the building for the accommodation of patients. This was in the summer of 1878.
Dr. J. E. Bowers, with over 10 years' experience as first assistant physician at St. Peter, was elected superintendent, and the Rev. A. H. Kerr, who had been a trustee from the beginning of the St. Peter Hospital, was chosen steward. On January 1, 1879, the institution was opened for the reception of patients. Transfers were made from St. Peter and new cases were admitted, and accommodations for 100 men were soon filled.
The Legislature of 1880 granted $20,000 for the erection of a wing on the west side for women. This was erected in the summer of 1880, and was ready for the furniture and heating apparatus when a disastrous fire occurred at St. Peter. Money for furnishing and heating was immediately provided. The building was hastily completed, and furnished room for over 100 women, who were transferred to relieve the crowded condition of the first hospital. In 1882 a large extension was built on the men's side, accommodating 200 patients, and costing when furnished $76,000. In 1883 and 1884 a similar wing was built on the west side for women, costing when furnished $83,000, thus completing the original design of the main structure, with a capacity for 600 patients. The building of a detached ward for women, authorized by the Legislature of 1887, was completed and accepted for occupancy on the 12th of February, 1890.
A modern power plant was constructed in 1916. Within the past few years a home for women nurses has been built and a club house for the men nurses is planned. The Legislature of 1909 appropriated $55,000 for the detention hospital and at the same time passed a voluntary commitment act. Into this building all the new patients are received. The hospital estate contains 1720 acres. The total number of inmates remaining in the hospital in January, 1914, was 602 men and 519 women.[1]
Treatment of mental diseases at the hospital before the 1920s consisted mainly of keeping patients occupied with work and recreation, and restraining violent patients. Many patients worked on the hospital’s 500-acre farm. Plays, concerts, and dances were put on for recreational purposes. In the late 1940s insulin and electroshock treatments were common, and in the 1950s lobotomies were used on some patients. Throughout the hospital’s history the use of drugs became more extensive. The hospital served as a surgical center for many of the other state institutions, as well as for Rochester State Hospital. The Mayo Clinic provided doctors free of charge, and the hospital absorbed the cost of supplies.
A major reconstruction program, begun in 1948, included the construction of two geriatric buildings, a powerhouse, and eleven staff houses.[2] The hospital’s campus continued to change as well. After World War II, there was an influx of geriatric patients. From 100 patients in 1879 the hospital grew to over 1,000 patients by 1900, and there were over 1,700 patients in 1955. With the old Kirkbride building unable to accommodate them, a major construction program began in 1948. By 1964, newer buildings served most of the patients and the Kirkbride structures were torn down. In 1965, the City of Rochester purchased 212 acres of the hospital’s farm land and turned it into Quarry Hill Park.
In the late 1970s, as the economy declined, the treatment of mental illness moved from state institutions to community-based facilities. In 1981, the Minnesota Legislature ordered Rochester to close as a cost-saving measure, triggering a state-wide controversy. Hospital staff and community members expressed concern that the closure would traumatize patients and damage the local economy. Unlike other state hospitals, which received patients through court orders, Rochester admitted a majority of its patients voluntarily. Patient advocates feared that closing the hospital would hurt those who sought help willingly. Despite these objections, the hospital closed in June 1982.
The Federal Medical Center, a prison for inmates with medical problems, was built on the hospital’s grounds in 1984. The prison used some of the detached hospital buildings but demolished others to allow for new construction. The center provides specialized and long-term physical and mental health medical care to male offenders.

Just north of the former State Hospital, 2,019 residents of the State Hospital were laid to rest between 1886 and 1965 in unmarked graves or graves only indicated by numbers stamped into concrete markers molded from coffee cans. After the hospital closure in 1982 a portion of the state hospital land was acquired by the city of Rochester and is now Quarry Hill Nature Center. When the city became responsible for mowing the old cemetery grounds, the cement grave markers wreaked havoc on their mowers and many of the markers were thrown into the nearby woods. The cemetery is now part of the Quarry Hills Nature Center.

Minnesota,St. Peter State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Peter_State_Hospital,,1866,1866,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Mostly Demolished),,Minnesota Asylum for the Insane | St. Peter Regional Treatment Center,"The St. Peter State Hospital began in March 1866 when the Minnesota State Legislature responded to the need for an asylum by passing ""an act for the establishment and location of a hospital for the insane in the state of Minnesota, and to provide for the regulation of the same."" The act also created a board of trustees and appointed six commissioners responsible for recommending a permanent location for the state's hospital. A number of Minnesota communities vied for the facility and each claimed to be the most attractive village. However, on 1 July 1866, the commissioners made their recommendation. They opted for St. Peter as the permanent site. Citizens of that community purchased a 210 acre farm for $7,000 which was given to the state for the purpose. Shortly after the commission's report was filed, the board of trustees purchased the Ewing house in St. Peter for temporary use until construction was completed on the permanent hospital. The board of trustees estimated that the refurbished Ewing house with accommodations for fifty patients would exceed the state's demands for years.
The Minnesota State Hospital for Insane accepted its first patient on 6 December 1866 and received more patients from Iowa on 28 December. In its first annual report to the governor, the board referred to the problem that would reoccur in the hospital's history for over the next 100 years. The original estimates of the board had proven incorrect as overcrowding had become the foremost problem two months after the hospital opened. In the spring of 1867, after a reorganization of the board of trustees, construction began on a temporary frame building adjacent to the Ewing property and when completed would house an additional fifty patients. In 1867, the board adopted the ""Linear Plan"" for the permanent hospital consisting of a center building with attached sections.
During the following ten years, construction proceeded on the permanent hospital while the board reluctantly expanded the accommodations of the temporary hospital to relieve the problem related to the increasing patient population. By 1876, construction ended. The new facility was capable of accommodating 500 patients and the valuation of the property was placed at $563,251.69. Because of the increasing number of patients, the hospital needed to continue operating the temporary buildings even though they needed extensive remodeling.
The problem of overcrowding was exacerbated in by a disaster on 15 November 1880 when fire destroyed the hospital's north wing before being contained. There was no insurance to cover the loss, and officials voiced concern over the possibility of another disaster. In response, the board recommended fireproofing the entire complex by replacing gas lights for electric lights and abandoning the temporary wood buildings.
Throughout the 1880s the hospital expanded. The north wing was rebuilt, two detached structures were erected to the north and south of the main facility, tunnels were built beneath the complex for the distribution of food, and a piggery, corn crib, and greenhouse were built. By 1892, the hospital's farm had expanded from the initial size to 810 acres, and numerous patients helped work the land. Besides providing food and employment opportunities, the farm was an economic necessity. Produce raised by patients and staff lowered the institution's food costs. However, the building projects had little effect in abating the institution's overcrowding by 1896. In response to similar conditions at the State Hospitals in Rochester and Fergus Falls, two new hospitals opened in Hastings and Anoka, Minnesota.
In 1906, the Board of Control, the new body of directors, recommended that patients considered dangerous or criminally insane be placed in a separate building located near one of the mental institutions where they could be given proper care. Legislators agreed and appropriated funds for a facility in St. Peter. By the spring of 1911, four separate institutions existed on the St. Peter campus: the mental hospital, the detention hospital, the hospital for tuberculosis insane, and the newly completed hospital for the criminally insane.
World War I necessitated stringent economic measures. Reductions in food, clothing, and other supplies mean that only the immediate needs of the patients could be satisfied. Inflation and a shortage of labor also affected the hospital, and in 1918, the influenza epidemic caused the death of thirty-two patients and one employee severely impacted the institution's population.
The postwar period brought prosperity, expansion, and new methods of treatment. Even the Great Depression had little negative impact on the institution because the Works Progress Administration provided funds for construction of a needed addition to the hospital's facilities. By the summer of 1939, the Board of Control was abolished and the Division of Public Institutions was created. This division within the Department of Social Security was responsible for the administration of the state's institutions while the remaining duties of the Board of Control were transferred to the Department of Social Welfare. After World War II, the institution continued to expand its facilities and enlarge its staff. By 1972, the St. Peter State Hospital consisted of over sixty buildings.[1]

The location of the earliest cemetery at the St. Peter State Hospital is not known. The cemetery had wooden crosses for markers and a prairie fire erased all landmarks in a large area and the location of the cemetery was never found. The second hospital cemetery was in what is now Resurrection Cemetery, the cemetery & land on this side of the highway was later sold by the state but the cemetery continued as a Lutheran cemetery named Resurrection Cemetery. The third cemetery is located on the grounds of the current hospital but up on top of the hill from the hospital campus. All of these graves now have monuments with names as well as their original markers with numbers.

The hospital had programs for the mentally ill, mentally retarded, and alcoholic. The patient population was all male, most of whom were transferred to Sandstone from other institutions in the state.

Johnston, Sr.",Hospital for Inebriates | Willmar State Asylum | Willmar Regional Treatment Center,"Built on an open farm field north of town, the Willmar Hospital Farm for Inebriates opened in 1912 with just 37 patients. Their treatment included working on the self sustaining farm where oats, barley, corn, timothy, vegetables and livestock where raised. During the hospital’s first 18 months, 84 inmates escaped, which “did little to alleviate the skepticism and stigma that had surrounded the new institution from the beginning.” The Willmar Hospital Farm for Inebriates was established by the state legislature in
1907 as Minnesota's second state hospital for alcoholics. (The first had been established in Rochester in 1873) The hospital was financed through a state tax of 2% on all liquor
license fees, and opened in December of 1912 with 2 major buildings and a 500 acre farm site. Two years later, in July of 1914, there were 314 patients at Willmar.
In March of 1917, the hospital was renamed the Willmar State Asylum and “so-called hopeless or custodial care cases” who were destined to become lifelong wards of the state” were housed at the facility.
From 1919 through the early 1930s, buildings were added to the campus in a steady schedule of new construction in an attempt to keep pace with the increasing population. New cottages for men and women, an administration building and auditorium were built. Mentally-ill patients arrived in rail coaches from other hospitals in Minnesota, increasing the population to 1,471. In 1937 the name was changed to Willmar State Hospital. During and after World War Two, shortages of staff and money resulted in deteriorating conditions at the hospital. Reports said patients were “forgotten people” who were “crowded like animals” and slept in “dingy attics.”
Improvements were made, and in the 1950s, doctors at the Willmar State Hospital developed a “holistic approach” to treating alcohol addiction that was later called the “Minnesota Model.” During that time, the hospital had a population of 1,483 and employed about 320 staff. A movie called “the Human Side” that addressed the nature and treatment of mental illness, was filmed primarily at the Willmar State Hospital and had a premier showing in Willmar on July 11, 1957, with Gov. Orville Freeman in attendance. A crowd of 1500 people attended the showing of the film, which received the Silver Award from the American Psychiatric Association.
By 1962, community mental health centers were opening in Minnesota and the population at the Willmar State Hospital shrank to 851. In 1969 the livestock and farm equipment at the hospital was sold and farm buildings were demolished.
In 1985, the hospital was given a new name,the Willmar Regional Treatment Center. In 2002, plans were initiated to close it. Today, most of the sprawling campus is owned by a private conglomerate of companies called Minn-West Technology that bought the site as part of a collaborative effort to save and reuse the buildings. Adolescent treatment programs are still done at one of the original cottages and outpatient services are provided at several offsite facilities.  360 degree images of the campus on the grounds of the hospital can be found on the Minn-West Tech site here [1].

The month of October, 1965, saw the largest number of patients in residence. There were 1,330 patients with 230 employees. The institution had to train all of its own psychiatric technicians with Miss Mabyl K. Johnston, R. N., who had her master of arts degree in nursing education, taking the responsibility for this training. Until her retirement in 1970, she trained 34 classes of psychiatric technicians.  In the beginning, nearly all of the residents to what was then the Brainerd State School and Hospital were from Cambridge State School and Hospital. The official name change to Brainerd State Hospital was made in 1971.
The Minnesota Learning Center was established in July, 1970, with the closing down of Owatonna State School. The Center, under the leadership of Warren Bock, program director, deals with educable retarded children with emotional problems which make it difficult for them to get along at home or in their community. This program serves all 87 counties of Minnesota and has 62 personnel assigned to it. There is a set limit of 85 students in this program.

In 1923, the law was amended to permit the purchase of a site for a colony for epileptics. Land was secured at Cambridge. The first expenditure voucher under the name of the Colony for Epileptics was dated December 20, 1923, for the purchase of 323 acres of land for $37,065.00 from T.C. and Adelaide C. Blomgren. The first unit (Cottage 1), a fireproof structure, was finished in April 1925. It was built by the Askov Construction Company. Cottage 1 was described as a self-contained building for men having its own kitchen, laundry, pump and well, heating plant, refrigeration, and everything necessary for the life of the patients there.  In May, a small workforce was sent from Faribault to uncrate the furnishings and prepare the buildings for occupancy. Patients were transferred in small groups by automobile beginning June 1, 1925. At the end of June, a total of 45 had been transferred. Later, with other transfers and admissions, the population was brought to a total of 61. A total workforce of only nine persons was required to conduct the institution as it was organized.
Under an appropriation of $255,000.00, a contract was awarded for erecting the Main Building. It was reported that the building would be fireproof and would contain the
Administration Offices, quarters for the superintendent and other employees, a hospital adequate for the whole institution when finished, wards for epileptic children, school and industrial rooms, recreation rooms, kitchen, dining room, pantry, cold storage and power plant. The Main Building was completed and opened August 22, 1927. Construction work on Cottage 2, a unit with a capacity of 72 females, began in August 1927. It was ready for occupancy by June 1928. By this time, the capacity of the institution was 284 and the number of employees was 37. A party and dance were held in the assembly room once a week. Special occasions, such as Christmas and the patriotic holidays, were observed with appropriate exercises under the direction of the school principal and assisted by the teachers.
By September, 1935, two new Cottages (3 and 4) were erected and ready for occupancy. This brought the capacity of the institution up to 460.  On October 2, 1931, eighteen acres of land was purchased from Christine Dahlsten for $2,000.00. This was located to the north of the existing campus and adjoined it. Total land was now 341 acres. Cottages 5 and 6 were completed and occupied by June 1932. A new power plant was constructed, necessitating the building of over 500 feet of service tunnel. It housed two 250-horsepower boilers with live storage for 400 tons of coal, had a smokestack 150 feet high, and was put into operation February 1932.  The old boiler house at the west end of the main building was remodeled into a new laundry. Cottages 7 and 12 were completed and occupied by February, 1934. Each had a capacity of 100. This brought the capacity of the institution up to 878.
On March 30, 1936, work started on Cottages 9 and 14 which would house 230 additional patients. These buildings were opened in March 1937. This brought the capacity of
the institution to 1,108. On July 26, 1937, 18 acres of land was purchased from Andrew Westberg for $1,800.00. Dr. D. E. McBroom, Superintendent, was granted a leave of absence beginning September 1, 1941, to head the Mental Health Unit. Dr. Royal C. Gray was appointed acting superintendent. The purpose of this program was to coordinate the medical and psychiatric activities of the various mental hospitals in an attempt to find an outlet for the many patients now being housed in state institutions but could get along outside, with some supervision; and to establish an “out-patient” clinic at the various hospitals.
The Biennial Report for the period ended June 30, 1946, showed 111 admissions, 27 re-admissions and 20 transfers during the past 2 years. There were 978 patients in the
institution, 109 on vacation and 6 on escape, making a total population of 1,093. [A total of] 238 women and girls and 91 men and boys attended school classes at the institution. The total number of employees was 130. The total expenditure budget for the 2 years was $611,517.56, or an average of about $22.00 per month per patient. Dr. R. J. Gully was acting
superintendent.
The 1949 Legislature changed the name of the institution from Minnesota Colony for Epileptics to the Cambridge State School and Hospital. A continuous research program had been in operation under the direction of Dr. Franz Hallberg and Dr. Rudolf Engle, Clinical Director. They worked with new medications for epilepsy. The Dormitory Building was completed by 1952. An addition to the power plant had also been constructed and in operation. The Dormitory was used as additional living space for employees. All employees had been required to live on the grounds from the time of the opening of the hospital until about 1945; then some were permitted to live off-grounds. All employees were subjected to a 24-hour call for duty. At times there was only one attendant on a ward for 60 patients. Each adult patient was then assigned to one child in another ward, a sort of foster mother or father arrangement. These adults would care for the child as if their own.
The 1955 Legislature authorized what was to be the last expansion in the bed capacity of the institution. A sum of $2,954,000.00 was appropriated for the construction and
equipping of ""a new hospital facility with a capacity of 500 beds for persons who were mentally deficient, also a necessary power plant addition."" These new buildings were Boswell and McBroom Halls and were opened in 1958. This brought the bed capacity up to its peak of 2,000. The population peak of 2,008 was reached in 1962. On July 1, 1961, the Cambridge State School and Hospital was given responsibility for the management of the Lake Owasso Children's Home, located 7 miles north of the State Capitol. The facility housed 130 residents who were mentally retarded. The state had leased it from Ramsey County since 1955 to accommodate residents of the Sauk Centre Children's Home when that closed. The home had been under the management of the Faribault State School and Hospital.  [1]
In 1965 the superintendent’s position was abolished and superseded by a medical director and administrator. Populations increased greatly in the 1950s and by the early 1960s the highest populations of 2,008 (approximately 12% of the total populations of residents of the state hospital system) was reached. During this era, state wide efforts were made to “humanize” living conditions in institutions as well as start rehabilitation treatments which lead to a decline in the population at Cambridge State Hospital. A lawsuit in 1972 was filed against six state hospital, including Cambridge State Hospital, for improper care, treatment, conditions and training “did not meet constitutional standards.” The lawsuit formed strict restrictions on the structure of the state hospital system, patient rights, and staff to resident ratios. The populations of Cambridge State hospital decreased by fifty percent before the lawsuit was finally settled in 1987.
Of the original buildings, several still stand today. Both Dellwood North and South are still used by other organizations, the Infirmary and Auditorium/Warehouse are used by M.E.T.O (Minnesota Extended Treatment Options Program), Cottage 11 “Oakview” has been renovated and is now used for office and overflow jail space, and the power plant has had the smokestack removed and is still standing. The rest of the land formerly occupied by the state hospital campus may be used for housing and a public park.
The burial area eventually grew to include five cemeteries, which occupied a plot of land behind the main buildings. The older graves are marked with stones that bear only patient numbers, as many of the patients came there without names. There are about 400 graves in the cemetery, now known as the ""Garden of Remembrance"".

In July of that year, a class was organized of fifteen children transferred from the Rochester and St. Peter state hospitals. Nine boys and five girls were transferred to the Experimental School from the st. Peter Hospital for the Insane. In the next year and a half eleven additional students were received from the St.Peter and Rochester hospitals for the insane or from their own homes. In 1881, the legislature directed that the School for Idiots and Imbeciles was no longer an experimental program and was to be connected with the Minnesota Institute for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind.
When the school opened it performed the functions of a school, a home, and a hospital. The three distinct departments were the School and Training Department, Custodial or Home Department, and Epileptic Hospital. In its later years, its functions included reducing the dependencies of mentally retarded individuals; providing care, treatment, and training for the purpose of returning persons to as normal a life as possible; assisting families in coping with the problems of mental retardation; fostering public understanding and involvement; promoting development and use of community services; and conducting research into causes, prevention, and treatment of mental retardation. The patient population consisted of persons of all ages representing all types and degrees of mental retardation, many of whom were also physically infirm.
May 20, 1881 a contract was let for construction of the new building, to be located south of the School for the Blind on land once owned by Alexander Faribault. The building consisted of a 3-story main section and a 2-story annex to the south, with a basement extending the entire length. (In later years the building was further extended to the south by the addition of a central tower and two sections.similar to the original two.) The following February fifty students moved into what was later to be called Center Building or Main Building. 1883 The superintendent's second biennial report indicated there were 41 students in the school and 59 applications pending. Annual total expenditures for the school had been $8,469 in 1881 and $10,055 in 1882. Dr. Knight recommended employment of a kindergarten teacher and need for a shop to provide ""useful occupation. If The charge to
parents or counties of students was set at $40 per year. In 1884 A contract was let for an addition to Center Building to bring its capacity to about 100. A tower and 3-story section were to be built.
In 1894 ""Sunnyside"" was first occupied as a distinct custodial or asylum building for those children unable to profit by schoolroom training. The corresponding building, known as ""Skinner Hall,"" was constructed in 1896 and named in honor of George E. Skinner, of St. Paul, a former trustee of the institution and whose influence had been exerted
strongly in support of a better classification of the inmates, realized by the construction of these buildings. The original administration ""building with the various additions
thereto since 1881 has been devoted to the work of school training.
A corps of twenty teachers conduct a well organized school in which manual and industrial training axe predominant features. For the girls there is training in netting, basketry, plain and fancy sewing as well as mending and darning, lace making, ironing, domestic work and gardening. And to the trained girls comes the opportunity to do work for which each has an aptitude. Such helpers, often quite independent, are found in the dressmaking and tailor shops, in mending room, kitchen and dining room, in the laundry and at the chicken ranch. While boys who are schooled in netting, basketry, sloyd work, mat braiding and sewing, and brush making later become valuable helpers in the care of their own departments, at the institution, mattress and cabinet shops, the barn, laundry, greenhouse, garden, farm and dairy.
March 1, 1900 A 40-bed hospital was opened. It was smaller than Dr. Rogers had requested, but south and east wings were added in the next few years. After a much larger hospital was built in 1938, the old hospital was re-named Oaks. In 1900 the first building distinctively for epileptics was erected as the beginning of the epileptic colony, which now has five cottages devoted to the care of this class of patients. Lind Cottage for epileptic boys was opened March 17, 1901. It was situated southwest of Springdale and was to be the start of a Colony for Epileptics. In 1902, A second cottage (Glen) at the Epileptic Colony was opened, all wing discontinuation of the program for epileptic males that
had been known as ""The Retreat."" That same year a cottage for 60 epileptic girls (Skinner Hall Annex 1, later renamed Iris) was built northeast of Skinner Hall. A U. S. Post
Office substation (""Station A"") was installed in the tower b:3sement of the Center Building. About 100 ""children"" were taken to the State Fair. The population had climbed to 887, but almost 1/4 (201) were on vacation on June 30.
December 20, 1902 A fire burned the roof and attic of the middle section of Center Building. The city fire department responded promptly, but there was a lack of water pressure. A messenger was dispatched to the School for the Deaf, whereupon the engineer there started the fire pump and ""gave us sufficient water pressure to enable the firemen to quickly control the flames."" After the fire the entrance to the tower section of the building was moved from the east to the north side and offices for the superintendent and
physicians were constructed above the former entrance. In 1904 a second Skinner Hall Annex for 60 females (later named Daisy), and an Annex to Sunnyside with a capacity for fifty persons (named Pawnee in recent years), were opened. The assembly hall in the main building was reconstructed; the roof and walls were raised, horseshoe-shaped ""gallery"" (balcony) was added, and the porches enclosed to provide interior corridors. Seating capacity in the hall exceeded 500.
The first burial of a resident took place in the institution's cemetery south of the main campus May 13, 1905. Previously those who died while in residence had been buried either in Faribault or in their home community.
The institution served the entire state until the mid-1950s, with a peak population of 3,355 in 1955. It then became a receiving institution serving 28 counties. Just prior to its closing, it served the counties of Hennepin, Dakota, Rice, Steele and Freeborn, but individuals from a number of other counties were still in residence.[1]",1998,"faribault, MN",,"3,355 in 1955"

During the first 14 months of operation, they cared for 85 children of parents with TB. The length of a child's stay could be a few weeks or as long as several years. The children lived in dormitories and attended their own two room school. The preventorium closed in 1953 and leased to the State of MN for $1 a year and reopened , in 1955, as an annex to Faribault State Hospital with the name of Lake Owasso Children's Home.

In 1975, the facility transitioned into housing adults. In 1978, it became the state’s first medium-security prison, housing adult males (a youth presence remains nearby, with the Anoka County Juvenile Center next door). Much of the prison’s emphasis at the time was on vocational skills. In 1993, however, the wood industry program and print shop were moved to other prisons, and programs and facilities to treat sex and chemical offenders were set up.

Minnesota,Owatonna State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Owatonna_State_School,1885,,1886,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Minnesota State School for Dependent and Neglected Children | State Public School,"The State Public School was established by the Minnesota legislature in 1885 as a public institution for dependent and neglected children between the ages of 3 and 14 (Laws 1885 c146). Although not intended to include infants, the State Public School did admit children younger than 3 under exceptional circumstances. Its goals were to educate the students under its jurisdiction, to find adoptive families for them, and to enable the students to be self-supporting upon discharge. Essentially, the school functioned as the state's public orphanage and adoption agency. Management of the school was vested in a three-member board until 1917 when the facility became subject to the State Board of Control, which was superseded in 1939 by the Division of Public Institutions, Department of Social Security.
A site selection committee oversaw construction of facilities in Owatonna in Steele County. The facility received its first students in 1886. The Board of County Commissioners in the children's county of residence committed children to the jurisdiction of the school after an investigation by the judge of the Probate Court. After 1917, such investigations were conducted by the Juvenile Court, if the county had a separate Juvenile Court. Education at the school stressed moral training, religious instruction, and manual training, such as cooking and sewing for girls and farming and woodworking for boys. Occasionally, older students took high school classes at the Owatonna High School.
In addition to finding adoptive homes for children, until 1936 the school practiced indentured placement (frequently termed placing out), whereby children were placed in homes (often farms) on contract to do work or to learn a trade in exchange for a payment to the state. Children who were not adopted or placed out were discharged when they became self-supporting, reached the age of majority (usually 18 for girls and 21 for boys), or when their parents were able again to care for them. In the twentieth century, the resident population of the school fluctuated between 200 and 400. More than 10,600 individuals were committed to the school during its history.
By 1945 state public welfare officials believed that early foster or adoptive placement was preferable to institutionalization and admissions ceased. In 1947 the State Public School was officially abolished and all its lands, buildings, property, and funds were transferred to the newly established Owatonna State School, which provided academic and vocational training for the mentally retarded until it closed in 1970. Today the property is still owned & used by the city, including the cemetery. There is also a museum on site dedicated to the history of the facility.
There are 198 known children buried at the cemetery. It is accessible by the public and maintained by the city.

Minnesota,Fandreau Indian Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fandreau_Indian_Boarding_School,1890,,,Active,,,Flandreau Indian Boarding School,"On March 24, 1890, George Pettigrew, hired John Eastman to lobby for the school in Washington. In a letter to Eastman in which he informed the lobbyist that citizens of Pipestone, Minnesota, were also looking for a boarding school, Pettigrew warned Eastman that the location of a school at Pipestone would ruin Flandreau.
In response, Eastman collected petitions from nearby reservations and delivered them to R. F. Pettigrew in Washington, D.C.
On May 13, 1890, the Senator acknowledged receipt of the petitions for the school at Flandreau and said he would present the information to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.
On August 13, Pettigrew advised Eastman that an appropriation bill to finance the school
finally had passed both houses of Congress and awaited the president’s signature. In
1891, Congress appropriated $72,000 for the purchase of a school site and the erection of
three buildings.
This appropriation included $2,000 to purchase 160 acres of land for the
site of an Indian Industrial School to be located near the village of Flandreau.
U.S. Indian Agent Helms and Hosea Locke, a local teacher, received instructions on
October 3, 1890, to select and secure options on land.
On October 29, Agent Helms reported the possibilities of a fertile and satisfactory location about one-half mile north ofthe town of Flandreau on the north quarter mile of section twenty-one at a price of $48 an acre.
Not surprisingly, the land belonged to Senator Pettigrew. Another site was
available about two miles northwest of the village at $10 an acre, and Helms reported
other desirable locations in the vicinity that would cost at least $3,000 or more.
On November 21, he recommended the purchase of the land from Pettigrew.
On the recommendation of the U.S. Indian Office, an inspector appeared to examine
the land options. Inspector Cisney reported one piece of land situated at the southeast
quarter of section 28, but found it to be too flat for adequate sewage disposal.
Ultimately, he recommended the purchase of the Pettigrew tract for $2,000 as the best buy. The sale was completed on March 30, 1891.
For temporary school quarters, employees at Flandreau moved an old school building
from near the river to the highest land on the boarding school property. Soon thereafter
workers began construction of new buildings.
Although classes were being held in temporary structures, ninety-eight pupils had already enrolled in classes.
By March 7, 1893, three buildings were completed. By the time of the construction of these buildings, twelve staff members had been hired. Following Rigg’s death in 1893, for a short time the school was called Riggs Institute.
The main objective in constructing such institutions was to build a model for
assimilation. The purpose of the school was to provide vocational training and language
skills to American Indians to assist them in assimilation.
Congress originally appropriated funds to operate the school only through 1892, but later found the project amenable enough to both the students and larger community to sustain it as a long-term institution.
On March 3, 1893, Congress appropriated $167 per pupil for each of the 100 students expected at the school. Congress also appropriated money to enlarge or improve the physical plant and curriculum at Flandreau.
By July 1892, Congress had provided more than $27,000 for construction of permanent buildings.
The government later purchased land to serve as an agricultural laboratory for the students.
The first permanent building constructed on the campus was Winona Hall, a two story
structure constructed of brick. The building served as both a girls’ dormitory on the
upper floors and as a dining hall on the lower level, with a seating capacity for 150.
It also contained an employee’s reception room, a girls’ reading and reception room, a dispensary, classrooms, the superintendent’s office, and a lavatory. Women students
lived on the second floor.
By 1895, as a consequence of overcrowding, the basement ultimately served as kitchen, dining room, and storerooms.
Because the enrollment at the school increased quickly, it became necessary to erect a brick and stone addition to the female dormitory. With this addition, the facility could accommodate 300 students.
The second building constructed at the school was the building where classes were
held. This two-story brick structure opened in 1892 and accommodated 150 students. It
contained four classrooms and a storeroom for books.
In 1900, the classroom accommodations were expanded, as additions were added and the school replaced the kerosene lighting system with electricity.
Over the next few years, other buildings were added. The male dormitory, Mayota
Hall, was constructed in 1892. It was a two-story brick building that contained six
bedrooms on each floor, with a reading room and a dressing room on the first floor. The building housed sixty young men and two employees.
In 1893, the government built both a barn and the fourth major building on the campus. This barn was a brick structure containing the boiler house, fuel room, carpentry shop, laundry, and bake oven capable of baking 300 loaves of bread at a time.
The next year, the school connected to the city water supply and thus enjoyed a system that provided better water for drinking, laundry, and a much-needed modem sewer system with indoor bathrooms for both the male and female dormitories.
In 1895, the school received a grant from the government of $52,000 to enlarge the
overall facility. With these funds the school officials built a hospital in the southwest
comer of the campus, an eight-room two-story frame cottage for the superintendent, and a two-story brick dining hall.
The second floor of the dining hall, boasting four three room apartments and a storage area, served as the living quarters for the staff. The dining hall, “Tiyo Tipi” (meaning center tent or the central part of the village where the feasts were held), was a two-storied round structure with a gabled roof and a stone foundation.
The first floor contained a dining room that served 400 students. It also contained a kitchen, bakery, and an employee office.
Other dormitories were added later in 1897, and in 1898 additional classrooms were added to accomodate more students.
Reports by government inspectors document the early development of the Flandreau
School during its earliest years. Inspector Jam.es P. McLaughlin, who served under the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior, evaluated the school in a report in 1897.
He described the brick buildings as relatively sound with minor rejoining work needed on the cement floors of the basement. He also briefly communicated about the two new buildings under construction and an addition to another.
One of the new buildings was comprised of a dining room, kitchen, and bakery on the first floor, and dining room, employees quarters,bath, and closets on the second floor. The other new building housed a large boys’ quarters with a reading room and two large spare rooms on the first floor.
The school occupied 160 acres of land, with forty-six acres set aside for cultivation. The rest of the property was divided into farm and school buildings or facilities.
McLaughlin reported that the school cattle herd included twelve milk cows, one bull,
thirteen young cattle, five horses, and five hogs. The forty-six acres in cultivation
included 200 bushels of corn, 600 bushels of potatoes, 100 bushels of turnips, 100
bushels of other vegetables, and ten tons of hay.
McLaughlin believed that Superintendent Leslie D. Davis of Flandreau Indian School was an excellent choice for his position.
In 1899 another federal agent, Indian Inspector Cyrus Bede, visited Flandreau Indian
School. He reported that the school had 225 students in attendance and offered that they
were all responsible for cooking, cleaning, and tailoring.
He described the facility as being in “good” condition and mentioned $3,000 that had been recently appropriated for new construction and repairs.
Bede also believed that the school as a whole was well managed, and in fact was one of the best government plants that he had seen. He suggested that the school plant would benefit from additional appropriations set aside for expansion of the buildings and grounds.
In 1900, James P. McLaughlin returned to examine the campus. He described the
school as having twelve buildings (seven brick and five frame), with three dormitories
that were formerly classroom buildings.
He reported also that the school cultivated thirteen acres of land, with twenty-five acres of potatoes and five acres of gardens, corn, and small grain. The farm also maintained a livestock herd of horses, milk cows, and cattle.
After 1900, the physical plant of the school was further developed. In 1903, the
school added a six-room vocational shop equipped with plumbing and lighting facilities, and by 1909 the facility also housed the printing office, blacksmith shop, carpenter shop, manual training room, a harness and shoe shop, a tailor shop, and painting department.
All of this vocational equipment supposedly would give Indians the skills necessary to assimilate.
By 1913, the school was comprised of 480 acres of land with fifteen brick and eight
frame buildings, all with steam heat and electricity.
The land had been purchased through the years, with the total value of the school listed at $250,000.
Between 1923 and 1924, the masonry students constructed a Library, Duplex, and Office building. Under the direction of the masonry instructor George Rae, the students also built a one story wood frame building. Students actually gained skills constructing several buildings at the school.
In contrast to the many construction projects during the first few decades, there were few projects after the 1930s. Students constructed a new shop building in 1932. This exercise and the resulting construction also was used for vocational classes.
Students learned masonry skills during the pouring and working of concrete.
The School purchased new equipment and machinery, including several latches, a large press, a power twin hammer, and a buffer. All were for training students in skilled work.
In 1932, the students also constructed a Home Economics building. This two-story structure was a carpentry class project from design to completion. On the first and second floors the girls’ vocational commercial foods and sewing classes were held. In the basement was a nursery for thirty children.
During the 1970s, the students constructed a cultural center that would ultimately bring the types of activities to the Indians that would help them accommodate to mainstream society. During this decade, Flandreau also added a greenhouse and three mobile home classrooms in 1974-1975.
These facilities either celebrated American Indian cultures or provided more classrooms for biology classes and/or facilitated Title I programming under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
The new building projects of the 1960s and 1970s reflected a resurgence in cultural pride, as well as a renewed interest in courting the federal government for funding.",,"Flandreau, MN",,
Minnesota,Minnesota State Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Minnesota_State_Training_School,,1889,1891,Active,Cottage Plan,W.B. Dunnell,Minnesota State Reform School | Minnesota Correctional Facility (Current),"In 1890 the Minnesota State Reform School relocated to Red Wing. The cornerstone was laid on May 20, 1890, and the facility formally opened in 1891. The original site in St. Paul was too small and the buildings crowded, inconvenient and greatly in need of repairs. The water supply was inadequate and the surrounding area was becoming more populated. The Minnesota State Reform School at Red Wing was renamed the Minnesota State Training School for Boys and Girls in 1895. An agency was established by the legislature to supervise children released from the Minnesota State Training School. The department was to furnish homes and supervision for children on parole. With an annual appropriation of $3,000, it was believed that if the department kept 20 children from returning to the training school, it would pay for itself.
Today the facility provides treatment, education, and transition services for 131 serious and chronic male juvenile offenders placed at the facility either as a condition of court-ordered probation or as the result of having been committed to the commissioner of corrections. The facility also provides 90- and 120-day short-term programming, detention and predisposition evaluation services as requested by the courts. In addition, the facility provides a separate community re-entry program for 42 minimum-security adult male offenders.
Juvenile residents participate in the facility’s cognitive/behavior restructuring and skill development treatment program. Skill development is facilitated by the use of the principles of restorative justice and therapeutic community. Risk/needs assessments are completed for each resident, and outcomes are used to develop the resident’s individual treatment plan. Monthly and quarterly reports are used to measure progress toward treatment plan completion. All residents are expected to develop an individualized relapse prevention plan and demonstrate its effectiveness during daily activities prior to their release.  The facility also has multiple program support services available within a regimented daily schedule.
Contrary to legend, Dylan never actually spent any time at Red Wing. Yet his 1963 song, The Walls of Red Wing,  presents a harrowing, if entirely imagined, portrait of the institution.

Minnesota,Morris Industrial School for Indians,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Morris_Industrial_School_for_Indians,,,1900,Active,,,,"The Morris Industrial School for Indians was founded in 1887 by a group of nuns from the Sisters of Mercy order under the leadership of Mary Joseph Lynch. Recruiting students from the Indian reservations was difficult for Lynch until she developed connections with the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, which had a high percentage of members converted to Catholicism. The number of students, instructors, and buildings slowly increased for the first few years of the school. By 1895, the staff size was 25 (24 nuns and 1 male supervisor) and the enrollment was 103 students (the largest Indian boarding school in Minnesota). Lynch maintained traditional practices and curriculum of a largely parochial education; however, unlike some other Catholic boarding schools, she did not allow corporal punishment.
When the government took over operation of the school in 1898, the Office of Indian Affairs agreed to purchase the school, (as it intended to take over operations from the Sisters of Mercy), but paid only half the price they asked. The Commissioner Daniel M. Browning offered the job of transitional superintendent to Lynch, but withdrew it and appointed William H. Johnson. The new school opened in 1898.
Johnson continued to expand the school and introduced ""progressive education"" under new federal recommendations. Academic instruction at the school included education from kindergarten until the eighth grade. The school integrated music programs, increased athletics, and started a literary society. Brick buildings replaced the wood ones constructed by the Sisters. A physical plant and sewage system were constructed, and the government acquired significant farmland for agricultural education at the school. Although Turtle Mountain Chippewa remained prominent, other Ojibwe reservations supplied a majority of the students. Under pressure to maintain enrollment numbers, Johnson took extraordinary measures to keep students at the school. He extended the length of terms, refused to release students for vacation, and used school staff to forcibly bring students back who had left the institution (sometimes for other boarding schools). Complaints from tribes and other educators were regular as a result of these practices. Johnson also recruited students without verifying Native American ancestry; he accepted some whites who were trying to get a free education. Johnson was fired in 1901 and replaced by John B. Brown.
Brown had a similar progressive curriculum but did not keep as tight control. Average attendance stood at around 160 students for most of Brown's term. On April 30, 1908, Congress authorized the Indian Appropriations Act, which reduced the number of federal Indian boarding schools in favor of schools located on Native American reservations. Native Americans had repeatedly asked for this to keep their families and communities together. The Morris Industrial School for Indians was selected as one of five schools to be transferred to state governments to be used for education of whites in exchange for the state offering free education to Native Americans. The school was transferred from federal to state control on December 9, 1908 and was authorized by legislation of Congress in March the next year. The Morris Industrial School for Indians closed in June 1909.",1909 (Original campus),"Morris, MN",,
Minnesota,Pipestone Indian School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pipestone_Indian_School,1893,,,Active,,,Pipestone Indian Boarding School,"The Pipestone Indian Boarding School opened in 1893 as a sister school to Flandreau, fifteen miles to the east of Flandreau, but located within Minnesota.
Almost from the outset, the Pipestone Indian School acted in equal capacities as a service center for education, health, and federal administration for enclaves of dispossessed Santee Sioux.
Pipestone also supervised the Birch Cooley (Coulee) Day School from 1899 until it closed in 1920.
Unlike the Flandreau Indian Boarding School, which primarily facilitated the needs of the Flandreau Sioux, Pipestone provided an education for Chippewa, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and Winnebago, as well as Santee Sioux children.
The school also offered a curriculum that mirrored Flandreau’s in its effort to assimilate fully the American Indian children.
Located two miles North of Pipestone, Minnesota, the school was constructed on 640
acres of excellent land, with 150 acres set aside for cultivation . The rest was left as
pastures/meadows for the school livestock and wild prairie grasses that provided hay for
the school.
The tract of land was originally set aside for the Yankton Sioux Indians by
the eighth Article of the treaty of April 19, 1858, in which tribal members were given free
and unrestricted use of the Red Pipestone Quarry for religious reasons.
The original structure of the school included a two-story stone building that included laundry and boiler house, a store house, shop buildings, a house stable, a cow stable, a chicken house, and two water closets.
The federal government originally constructed this first structure for $10,000, and in its entirety, it was larger than Flandreau Indian School.
The Secretary of the Interior issued the first official report of the Pipestone Indian
Boarding School in the fall of 1894. Inspector McCormick commented on the school’s large enrollment of pupils for the first year of operation.
He listed several students under the age of five, who needed extra attention from the matrons.
The overall capacity for the school within the first decade of operation was at seventy-five, which was less than that of Flandreau Indian School at 150 students. The ultimate goal of Pipestone was to facilitate upwards of 150 youngsters, but until then Flandreau was responsible for accommodating the overflow.
In terms of the facility buildings, McCormick suggested that there be renovations
made in plastering, locks and doors repaired, insulation provided, and windows washed.
He also noted that the children maintained the buildings and grounds. McCormick’s only
suggestions were that the laundry room and boiler room be separated because of fear of
fire, and that they employ a regular physician at $100 “per annum”.
Inspector A. J. Duncan issued another survey of the school in the spring of 1900.
Depicting Pipestone as a non-reservation boarding school, he described the facilities as
“superior buildings of stone” constructed of red pipestone from the nearby quarry.
In his overview, he mentioned the general dormitory, kitchen, dining room, and employees’
quarters, which were all heated by steam and lighted by gas.
Duncan’s only complaints were cosmetic, suggesting that the boiler be replaced, that the school construct a new dormitory to relieve overcrowding, purchase a new laundry machine ( concern for crushed hands and arms), and re-plaster the buildings.
Duncan’s other observations were placed under separate sub-headings and took a
more “holistic” approach to the physical plant/staff than did the previous surveys.
He included information on the water supply and fire protection program. The water supply
came from 200 feet beyond the main building, in a tank of seventy-five feet that carried up to 500 barrels.
The pump elevation was six feet and supplied bathing water to all buildings. The school’s fire protection program was more than adequate, in Duncan’s view. The school had a fire hose connected to the water supply in every hall, and the children were frequently organized into fire brigades with regular fire drills.
The superintendent of the schools personally supervised all of this. Finally, Duncan reported that the school grounds boasted several shade trees and fruit trees, with a stock of four horses, twenty cows, and 83 sheep. Duncan also reported that there
were 100 children in attendance.
By 1915, Pipestone rested on 685 acres worth $41,000 with twenty-six buildings
worth $80,000. There were seven separate heating buildings worth $3,000, that supplied
nine buildings a year with heat.
The electric system operated yearly at $2,250 and the water system and sewer system were $4,500 and $800 a year, respectively. The total cost of the school plant was $150,000.
Pipestone also featured a health facility that was worth $5,925 a year.
Some of the improvements that were suggested in this respect included the remodeling of the boys’ dorms to resemble those at Flandreau Indian School, a new sanitary system for the boys, and remodeling of the basement in the boys’ dorms.
Other general repairs or construction projects included extending the electric power system, indoor gymnasium, a domestic science building with equipment, central heating plant and power house, more sleeping porches, a new shop, and building a new basement for the girls’ dorm.
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs ended his report by praising the dairy barn and yard, with its top-quality herd and the excellent supply of playground equipment. More specifically, a baseball diamond, two basketball courts, one tennis court, two giant strides, twelve swings, two ladders, twelve flying rings, two horizontal bars, one climbing
pole, three slides, and one football field.
He also praised the required military drill with eighteen to twenty minutes of daily marching.
Before closing, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs underscored the need for an
indoor gymnasium and domestic science building, a central heating plant, powerhouse,
and sleeping porches for tuberculosis patients. He also recommended that an alarm
system be installed in the girls’ dorm.
Other suggestions included partitions in the girls’ dorm closets and that Pipestone students should have free and open access to the Birch Cooley Day School playground.
A year prior to this, the Commissioner had asked for more funds for a school library and a separate home economics building.
As the school rapidly expanded during the 1910s, the staff had trouble exponentially matching federal funds for new buildings and necessary repairs.
In the 1920s, the Pipestone Indian Boarading School continued to act as a focal point for activity within the Indian Field Service and the local community, while financing structural
repairs.
For instance, in 1924 Pipestone built a Dutch Colonial-style domestic service cottage at a cost of $3,500, with labor furnished by the Pipestone student body. In terms of sharing excess supplies between area schools such as Pipestone, Flandreau, and other area agencies, this was a common occurrence. More specifically, they shared beds, refrigerators, and toilet paper.
In1924, the Superintendent of Lower Brule Agency offered a requested extra refrigerator to be shipped from Lower Brule to Pipestone Indian School.
Similarly in February of 1926 Superintendent J.F. House of Flandreau Indian School respectively asked that Pipestone fudian School be authorized to transfer 200 single beds. These were shipped by freight from Pipestone to Flandreau, with the charges paid for by “Indian Money”, proceeds of labor, and the Flandreau School.
This example reflected active communication within the community and Indian Field Service in regarding supplies.
The final decade for Pipestone came in the middle of John Collier’s New Deal, as it
reached its fruition and then subsequently was replaced by the termination/relocation era
of the late 1940s and early 1950s.
As a result of the legislative revolution during the 1930s, there was a simultaneous push for curriculum reform and boarding school closures in favor of day schools, which Pipestone adhered to.
After sixty years of operation, Pipestone Indian School closed its doors for the last time in 1953 after undergoing a variety of shifts in staffing, programming, and grade changes.
From its inception to its closure, Pipestone, like Flandreau Indian School, acted as an
area office, health facility, and academic setting for dispossessed Native peoples.
The schools also provided a central tribal identity for a Dakota people that were living as
individual citizens on separate plots of land or as enrolled members of other bands of
Sioux on the Santee or Yankton reservations in Nebraska and South Dakota.
With political backing from South Dakota U.S. Senator, Richard F. Pettigrew, the immediate goal of either facility in the 1890s was to simply educate and assimilate the Native population.
Within a relatively short period of time, it was obvious that both institutions went beyond merely serving as academic settings. In reality, each anchored the local white and Native American populations by providing employment, healthcare, and education for the community.
Through several decades of changes in leadership, curriculum philosophies, and various building projects, both schools managed to maintain their presence in the region well into the twentieth century.
Pipestone closed, however, due to direct pressures from New Deal legislation.",,"2 Mi N of Pipestone, MN",,

Afterwards claims were allowed from the Overseer of the Poor, under whose direction the townships were to care for their poor. One pauper, Jane Sconce, was cared for by the county for more than 20 years. She was regularly farmed-out annually to the lowest bidder.  From 1847 to 1880 pauper claims averaged about $550 per year.
In 1859 the County Board took steps to purchase a poor farm, but after viewing several locations and found that the final cost was more than they cared to pay the project was abandoned. Then in 1869 the County Board purchased 244 acres of land adjoining Nashville on the east side from Thomas M. Adams. The cost was $5000 which was paid in two equal installments. William Waltman was contracted to construct a frame poor house to sit on their land to be 30 x 60 feet in dimension for $1474. It was a two-story frame house with a basement. It was completed in 1870 at a final cost of $1600.
The first Superintendant of the Poor Farm was John Taggart. He received the use of the farm and $3085 for caring for the poor for a period of three years. In 1872 Caleb Ferguson became Superintendent and he was paid $675 per year plus the use of the farm. He was succeeded in 1877 by Benjamin R. Kelley for $277.50 per year plus the use of the farm. Thomas J. Taggart became Superintendent in 1879 and then Ambrose Fraker in 1883. The number of poor farm residents ranged from eight to fifteen people.
In 1896 when Clark Campbell resigned as Superintendant there were twenty-three acres of corn, a patch of potatoes, hay in the barn, and a large garden with turnips, cabbage, and beans growing. The County Board of Commissioners financed other groceries and necessities from stores in Nashville, as well as repairs on the buildings and farm equipment maintenance. Brown County residents regularly gave food, supplies, and helped out on the farm when the residents could not. The county home remained useful for 93 years. With the resident population declining after the advent of Welfare and the Social Security system the County Commissioners decided to close the home on April 1, 1963. On Sept. 7, 1965 the Brown County School Corporation bought the old Poor House with 15 1/2 acres. It is used this day as their Administration building. The house is now listed with the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana.

Minnesota,Wabasha County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wabasha_County_Poor_House,,,1873,Preserved,Single Building,,,"In 1864 the Minnesota Legislature passed a law requiring each of the state's counties to provide a facility to care for their poor and aged residents. Wabasha County initially established its poor farm in 1867 on 160 acres in Hyde Park Township. However this quickly proved to be too isolated and large to manage efficiently, so the county secured 32 acres on the outskirts of Wabasha in 1873.
The main building on the property at that time was originally a barn that had been converted to a dance hall. Even though the owner had refitted the building at his own expense before selling it to the county for use as a poorhouse, it and the rest of the existing buildings were not adequate for their new use. These were gradually replaced with new, purpose-built structures, namely the hospital in 1879 and the residence hall in 1883. The latter building contained not only the residents' rooms but a kitchen, a dining room, and quarters for the superintendent. Welfare largely remained the responsibility of county governments and social organizations until the Great Depression of the 1930s, when federal Social Security was introduced. Citizens in local government facilities were not fully eligible for the new benefits, however, so many residents moved out of the poorhouse network. Wabasha County responded by privatizing the poorhouse, leasing it out as a for-profit rest home so residents could remain and collect federal benefits.
The facility closed as a rest home in 1952. It stood vacant for four years, but from 1956 into the 1980s the main building housed a restaurant and residence. The property remains one of the few intact examples of the 64 poorhouse facilities established in Minnesota from 1854 to 1926.",1952,"Wabasha, MN",,
Minnesota,Washington County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Washington_County_Poor_House,,,1867,Preserved,Single Building,,Pine Point Nursing Home,"Six years after Ramsey County established a poor farm, Washington County set aside 207 acres of land in Stillwater Township for one of its own. Harvey Wilson, the Washington County clerk of court, was instrumental in the purchase of the land. An 1881 history of Washington County described the poor farm as a ""comfortable two-story frame building, affording all the necessary comforts for those who are in any way constrained to make this their home. It has two barns furnishing ample convenience for stock and grain.""
John S. Proctor became the first superintendent of the poor farm and served in that capacity until he was appointed warden of the state prison in 1860. Following Proctor as the superintendent was Joseph N. Masterman, then C.A. Peterson, and then George Jarchow in 1895.
During the early years of the poor farm, its residents were men, women, and dependent children as well as the mentally ill and the insane. These people had nowhere to turn, no social security or welfare system that would help them get a foothold and re-enter society. There were some births at the Poor Farm as well as many deaths.
In 1890, the county physician reported seven deaths at the poor farm. In 1895 there were three deaths. A year later, four deaths were reported. If a resident didn't have any family to speak of, the person who had passed away would simply be buried in the unmarked ""farm cemetery."" It was an insane man that led the Washington County Board to call for the enlargement of the farm's barn ""to build a suitable lock-up for the safe keeping of a crazy man on the poor farm,"" in September 1859. Another incident with the insane was told in the Stillwater Messenger of February 13, 1859. According to the paper, an insane woman was admitted to the poor farm, but it was learned that she was from Dakota County. The Washington County Sheriff then brought her back to Dakota County, with the newspaper adding, ""our Dakota friends didn't play the dodge very well.""
At the poor farm, the residents helped maintain the facilities as well as grow crops and help in the care of the farm's livestock. The farm was run by the county but tried to be as self-sustaining as possible. Those residents who could work on the farm were encouraged to do so. However, Superintendent Jarchow once noted that the ""average pauper and laborer are not the best of friends."" If more help were needed, the superintendent would hire out.
A lake on the Poor Farm property is named Lake Louise. Legend claims that the lake is named after a resident of the farm, named Louise or possibly a child named ""Hannah Louise,"" who drowned in that body of water. There are no records that show that the drowning happened, so if it did, it must have happened in the early history of the Washington County Poor Farm.
In 1913 F. Ulrich took over as superintendent of the poor farm and stayed until 1919 when Albert A. Cran assumed that responsibility. In 1914, an inventory of the poor farm clearly shows how the farm tried to care for itself. By that time there was 247 acres of land, four brood mares, one old mare, 120 chickens, 12 cows and a pantry full of vegetables, foodstuffs, and kitchen utensils. Clothing and bedding including 43 pairs of overalls were counted in the inventory. The total value placed on the farm that year was $42,067.65.
As time went on, the number of residents at the farm continued to increase. By 1881, a two story framed building could hold 30 residents, but by 1922, the buildings were old and the number of residents was up to 39. Because of the increases and the age of the structures the county built a new, two story brick structure which was occupied on January 1, 1925.
With a new building came a new director, Mr. Henry Reier. Under Reier the farm grew and the building even received electricity in 1936. By 1937, a total of 360 acres were being farmed. When Reier took over, the name of the poor farm was changed to the ""Washington County Home."" By 1937 there were 63 residents making the farm their home. In 1941, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Schmidt took over the directorship, which wasn't a difficult adjustment for Mrs. Schmidt because she was the daughter of Henry Reier.
During the early 1940s, when war was raging throughout the world, the area northeast of the present acreage, on a hill adjacent to County Road 55, was used for spotting airplanes during the blackout times. The railroad siding, called the Kilty siding in the 1901 Washington County Plat book, was where supplies for the County Home could be unloaded. During the late fall, a boxcar full of coal was left there for three days and had to be unloaded at that time using only the horse and wagon from the farm.
Gradually the County Home became primarily a home for the aged. Under the laws of Minnesota, chapter 610 of 1951, the Washington County Home was renamed the Pine Point Nursing Home. In 1958, the county built a manager's living quarters across the street from the nursing home. This was the first time the manager/supervisor was not living directly with the home. It was also about this time, according to Superintendent William Schmidt, that the farming operation on the farm ceased supplying foodstuffs to the home due to new health regulations.
The Schmidts remained the administrators of Pine Point until 1975, when Mr. Dick Ulrich took over. It was only two years later, in May 1977, that Pine Point Nursing Home closed. The Home was closed due to increasing strict health and space regulations. It would have been just too costly to bring the Pine Point Nursing Home up to the new standards.
The brick structure sat vacant for several years, suffering damage from neglect and vandals. Then, in June 1981, there was some beginning discussions on selling the nursing home and 26 acres that surround it. The Washington County Board of Commissioners unanimously moved that the county staff prepare specifications and advertise for bids on the building and surrounding property. At the time, county deputy administrator Rip Riebel said ""We decided that we'd better do something with the building soon before it deteriorates to the point of being useless.""
It was also at this time that the county commissioners were asked to make an ""unusual ruling"" in the case of the ""farm cemetery."" At that time, the county was allowing a farmer to grow beans on the cemetery and it was deemed an ""inappropriate use."" Arthur Nelson of Cottage Grove pointed out it was the county's responsibility to care for the cemetery. However, County Attorney Robert Kelly said that the state statute indicates that counties ""may"" expend public money to maintain a cemetery but is in no way obligated to do so. The county did not appropriate money for the farm cemetery, and it is still today neglected and abandoned with up to 100 of the county's poorest people buried in it.
In May 1982, Leland, Linda, and Carolyn Gohlike placed a $78,000 purchase bid for the building and 26 acres of land. They hoped to create a lodge and restaurant. After some negotiations and a number of permits that had to be issued, the sale went through in November 1983. The Gohlikes made it into the Outing Lodge at Pine Point and a bed and breakfast facility with a meeting hall.

Minnesota,Buena Vista State Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Buena_Vista_State_Sanatorium,,,1917,Demolished,Single Building,,Buena Vista Rest Home,"The Buena Vista Sanatorium opened in 1917 on a hill overlooking the city of Wabasha to serve residents of Wabasha County.  Several patients came from neighboring counties, especially Winona and Olmsted. Beginning in 1921, Wabasha and Winona together operated the sanatorium. The sanatorium struggled financially throughout its existence because the 30-bed capacity did not generate enough income for upkeep and salaries. In 1927, 69 percent of the patients were ""free pay,"" which meant their cost of care was paid by state aid of $5 per week. The cost of care per patient, per day, was $3.45 at that time. As one of several cost-saving measures, three nurses worked eight-hour shifts, with one-half day off each week and one day off each month.
Assistance was requested from the Works Progress Administration to erect an additional building, but funding was denied because there was not a sufficient number of unemployed skilled construction laborers in the two counties to justify WPA support. The sanatorium also supported the work of county nurses to identify and isolate tuberculosis in the early stages. Because Buena Vista accepted patients with only incipient or moderately advanced cases of tuberculosis, the ratio of deaths to admissions was relatively low. In 1956, the buildings were converted to the Buena Vista Rest Home, which has since closed. The site now consists of private residences.[1]",1955,"Wabasha, MN",,
Minnesota,Cuenca Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cuenca_Sanatorium,,,1910,Demolished,Single Building,,Children's Preventorium of Ramsey County,"Cuenca Sanatorium was Ramsey County's first attempt to provide a hospital for consumptive patients  in a rural setting.  The St. Paul Anti-tuberculosis Committee paid $10,000 for the construction of a two-story building on the northeast side of Bass Lake (now known as Lake Owasso). It opened in January 1910. The building's first floor had two wings in addition to the wards in the main structure. It could accommodate 30 patients, but soon transitioned to caring mostly for children from ages 6 to 12. The medical director was Dr. Henry Longstreet Taylor, and there was no charge for care.
Unfortunately, the facility experienced several problems with sewage discharge into the lake. In 1912, the Anti-tuberculosis Committee asked the state's Board of Control to assume responsibility because of the problem. The commissioners declined, and the sanatorium closed. It reopened in July 1915 as the Children's Preventorium of Ramsey County, operated by a corporation formed by some St. Paul residents and funded by donations. In 1927, the main building burned and was replaced by brick buildings. The Preventorium closed in 1953.

It was built midway between Aitkin and Brainerd in order to be fair to the counties' two largest cities. This placement also put it almost three miles from the nearest railroad depot in the town of Deerwood, a common mode of transportation for visitors. The sanatorium never exceeded its opening capacity of 24 beds.  Because It was not large enough to provide modern medical procedures as tuberculosis treatment evolved, patients were often transferred to Glen Lake or Nopeming sanatoriums for surgery. There were several superintendents and medical directors. Dr. E. G. Hubin served the longest, from 1931 to 1946.
Deerwood Sanatorium ceased operation on February 21,1951, with the remaining patients transferred to Nopeming Sanatorium near Duluth.  The main building was converted to a nursing home, Cedar Brook Manor, in 1952. After the nursing home closed in the 1970s, the site was used for a skating rink and hockey camp.[1]",1952,"Brainerd, MN",,

It was scheduled to begin admitting patients in February, but delays in the shipment of laundry equipment meant a postponement until May 6. The sanatorium served the counties of Wadena and Todd.  Its opening capacity was 20 beds, which expanded to 36. The first superintendent was Dr. George Waldie, who arrived in Wadena from the Sassaquin Sanatorium in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  Dr. Waldie also served as superintendent of the Buena Vista Sanatorium at Wabasha until 1926 when he moved to Michigan. From 1937 to 1945, Dr. Walter Broker served as superintendent at Fair Oaks, a position he had previously filled at the Otter Tail Sanatorium.
Two other physicians served briefly as superintendents, but after 1949 the county administrators were unable to fill the position.  Fair Oaks Lodge closed in November 1951, and patients were transferred to Ah-gwah-ching State Sanatorium near Walker.

Lake Julia's original capacity of 25 doubled to 50, and it served four counties: Beltrami, Hubbard, Itasca, and Koochiching.  From 1916 to 1922, the sanatorium had six administrators. In 1921, Dr. R. L. Laney was appointed superintendent at Lake Julia, and he arrived to discover a typhoid epidemic.  Several people, including a nurse and a physician-patient, had died. Dr. Laney traced the epidemic to a typhoid-carrier patient who had polluted the lake's water, which was being pumped into the sanatorium's plumbing because its well had malfunctioned.  He quickly arranged to have two standby wells drilled and had the original well repaired. He also brought stability to the institution by staying for nine years.
After Dr. Laney's departure in 1930, Dr. Mary Ghostley was appointed medical director and superintendent at Lake Julia. She earned her Doctor of Medicine degree at the University of Minnesota in 1909 and practiced medicine at International Falls before arriving at Lake Julia. She became especially accomplished at reading x-rays and contributed to the control of tuberculosis in the four-county area through her examinations of people who reacted positively to TB tests.
The Sanatorium became Lake Julia Rest Home in 1954, which closed in 1968.

Its capacity of 34 increased to 100. Mineral Springs benefited from its proximity to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, with several of its physicians available to patients on a consultant basis. The nearness also had a downside, because nurses could obtain a larger salary at the Clinic. As a result, the sanatorium found it difficult to maintain an adequate nursing staff.
Mineral Springs Sanatorium was briefly used as an adolescent treatment center but was abandoned in the 1980s. The buildings were demolished in 1991, with the exception of the administrator's house. The sanatorium campus is now the site of several private homes.[1]",,"Cannon Falls, MN",,
Minnesota,Minnesota State Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Minnesota_State_Sanatorium,1905,,1907,Demolished,Cottage Plan,Clarence H. Johnston Sr.,Minnesota Sanitorium for Consumptives | Ah-Gwah-Ching Center,"The Ah-Gwah-Ching Center, located about two miles south of downtown Walker, Minnesota, once was home to hundreds of tuberculosis patients who lived and worked on the property. The center opened in December 1907. Known then as the Minnesota Sanitorium for Consumptives, its primary purpose was to treat cases of tuberculosis. The facility was designed by state architect Clarence H. Johnston Sr., who also is known for creating the plans for many homes along St. Paul's historic Summit Ave. Originally meant to house 65 patients, by 1927 the facility had 300 patients, according to an article in the Walker Pilot newspaper. The facility still is licensed for 343 beds, but only staffs 155, according to the Minnesota Department of Human Services, when it closed. In June 2008 just 105 patients were housed at Aw-Gwah-Ching.
Soon after the opening of the sanatorium it became apparent that more than a single facility was needed to serve the state. Reported cases of tuberculosis rose from 1,471 in 1890 to 1,864 in 1900 and 2,270 in 1910. To meet this rising demand, in 1913 the facilities at Walker were supplemented by a system of county sanatoriums and the advisory commission was given the power to approve plans for them.
Perhaps the most impressive part of the center's history is its art collection. During the Depression, Geving said, lithographs, watercolors, wood sculptures and other art forms were created and put on display at Aw-Gwah-Ching as part of the Works Progress Administration's Federal Arts Project.
In 1957, the official name of the sanatorium was changed to the Minnesota State Sanatorium. After its closing in 1962, the sanatorium at Glen Lake (Hennepin County) was designated as the state facility for tubercular patients.  That year, Aw-Gwah-Ching was converted to a state-owned nursing home for people with ""challenging behaviors,""The facilities at Walker became the Ah-Gwah-Ching Nursing Home, a state institution for geriatric patients.  Its last patients left early 2008 and it officially closed later that year.

It operated under the direction of a three-member St. Louis County Sanatorium Commission, appointed June 8, 1909 by the St. Louis County Board of Commissioners that was established April 21, 1909 (Minnesota Laws 1909 c437 p398: Act to enable counties to establish and maintain public tuberculosis sanatoria.). The enabling act by the legislature was introduced at the request of officers of the Duluth anti-tuberculosis committee, P. Neff, chairman, Dr. E. L. Tuohy, vice-chairman. A bill was drafted by W. J. Stevenson, assistant county attorney, and was introduced to the legislature by Dr. A. J. Gates of Kenyon, Minnesota at the request of the St. Louis County delegation.
The St. Louis County Board appointed a three-member Sanatorium Commission of Dr. E. L. Tuohy and George A. Gray of Duluth and Walter J. Smith of Eveleth on June 9, 1909. The first Secretary and Superintendent, Dr. William ""Billy"" M. Hart, was appointed and began his duties May 5, 1910. Hart was previously with the Trudeau Sanatorium at Saranac Lake, and had been a tuberculosis patient. He remained until August 10, 1911, when he left for Canada to do similar work.
The choice of location was thoroughly investigated and five principles determine comparative advantages: accessibility, protection, sanitation, scenic environment and agricultural development. The St. Louis County Board appropriated $19,625 to initially authorize the purchase of an 80 acre site located in T49 R15 section 95 (Midway) for the facility on September 1, 1910, expanding it to 269.72 acres in 1924. The site was reached by state road no. 1 ""the new partly paved highway to the Twin Cities"". The site bordered the St. Louis river valley, and the Nopeming Station of the Canadian Northern Railway was close by.
The contract for the first building was awarded May 22, 1911. The basement of the building was completed August 8, 1911, and in the spring, the Main building and a Children's Cottage were finished. Duluth citizens contributed $5,491 in 1911 and $5,491 in 1912 for the Children's Cottage. By the late 1920s there were 30 buildings valued at $500,000.
In 1938 an operating room was installed on the fourth floor of the Chateau to accommodate all needed chest surgeries, a sprinkler fire suppression system was installed, and a $143,000 levy was voted by the County Board to add two 50 bed units to the sanatorium. An additional $23,650 was voted against 1939 county property to finance completion of the addition. In investment of $350,000 was celebrated in October, 1948 with a new 76 bed wing bringing the total number to 340.
In 1954, a study was conducted to determine the possible alteration of a Nopeming building for use as a nursing home for the aged. In August, 1957, nursing home patients began to be admitted, and in December, 1971, the facility ceased to be a tuberculosis sanatorium and became the Nopeming Nursing Home.  TB patients became the responsibility of the St. Louis County Health Department, and the Welfare Department started operating the Nopeming facility as a county nursing home. These changes resulted in a $140,000 remodeling program in 1972.
The financially troubled county-owned facility operated at a loss. St. Louis County decertified 12 beds in March 1997. The management firm Health Dimensions operated Nopeming Nursing Home beginning in the fall of 1997. The seven-member St. Louis County Board of Commissioners advised the state Department of Human Services to decertify 33 beds at the home, reducing the total number of beds to 159, due to a decline in occupancy. The Nopeming's name changed again on April 5, 2000 to Nopeming Care Center; in March, a 40 member Long Term Care Task Force was appointed by County Commissioners, and the Eden Alternative was examined for implementation at the facility.
State funding issues resulted in the February 26, 2002 County Board decision and vote to close the facility amid local outcry (summer, fall, winter of 2001-2002) that focused particularly on the need for placement elsewhere of the 50 Alzheimer's and dementia patients. Nopeming's 151 patients were moved in November 2002 to the county-owned Chris Jensen Health and Rehabilitation Center in Duluth where approximately 88% of the 235 beds were occupied. Based on $2,080 annually for each of the 159 Nopeming beds, lawmakers said St. Louis County would gain $300,000 annually from the State by closing Nopeming and moving patients and staff to Chris Jensen. Nopeming was shuttered November 25, 2002.",2002,"Duluth, MN",,
Minnesota,Oakland Park Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oakland_Park_Sanitarium,,,1918,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The Oakland Park Sanatorium opened in January 1918 in Pennington County near Thief River Falls.  Marshall and Roseau counties were also members of the sanatorium district. Red Lake County joined ownership in 1922. The sanatorium initially provided beds for 24 patients. Rates when it opened were $7 for member-county residents, $10 for non-residents, and no charge for indigents. As in other county sanatoriums in Minnesota, preference for admission was given to advanced cases of tuberculosis. By 1932, occupancy averaged 54 patients. Substantial improvements to the campus were paid in part by funding from the Federal Works Progress Administration.
In 1954, the remaining patients were transferred to Sunnyrest Sanatorium in Crookston. Rooms at Oakland Park were remodeled to accommodate nursing home residents, and it became the eighth sanatorium in Minnesota to become a rest home.  In 1966, Roseau and Red Lake counties withdrew their membership. By 1972, the original building was inefficient and out of compliance with state and federal regulations for nursing homes.  Marshall County sold its interest to Pennington County and a new single-level building was constructed. The ""Old San"" was used as a dormitory for community college students for a while and then stood empty. It was razed in March 1999.",,"Thief River Falls, MN",,
Minnesota,Otter Tail County Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Otter_Tail_County_Sanatorium,1912,,1913,Demolished,Single Building,,,"In 1912, the Otter Tail County Commissioners voted to purchase land and erect a building for the care of tuberculosis patients. The building was located on the Northwest side of Otter Tail Lake. A frame building was erected in 1913, and dedicated in October of the same year. There was room for 37 beds in the original building.
An addition was added to the kitchen on the north end of the building a few years later, making the overall length of the building 126 feet long by about 50 feet wide.
History that was made by people who served as doctors, nurses and people helping in any way to help serve the patients seems to be lost at this time. Many persons were healed and went out to live active lives, but others died at the Sanatorium and had families, relatives or friends that saw to their burial. At least five patients died that had no one to claim their bodies, so were buried in the field west of the sanatorium, across the road. No records of who were buried out that have been found at present. However, something may come to light some day. (Addition: In 2009 Signe Boyesen's name was added to our list of known burials at this site based on her death record. She died May 11, 1917.)
Kenneth Peterson who lives in the area, went with the writer to the place where the patients were buried and gave this information: When Kenny was in his teens, the doctor at the sanatorium hired him to do odd jobs. On the jobs was to help build a coffin, dig the grave and bury the last patient (a man who died at the sanatorium without relatives and friends). Wooden crosses made of 2x4's marked the graves. It was Kenny's job to paint the crosses white every other year as long as the doctor was in charge. We found one stake in the ground with the cross piece laying on the ground. Now a steel post with a red top marks the site. Depressions in the ground mark the other four graves.
By 1954, with the knowledge of new drugs and methods of treatments, only a few patients were left in the big building. Consequently, the patients were moved to the sanatorium in Walker, MN. The old sanatorium was used for a county nursing home for a year or two until a new nursing home was built, between the old sanatorium and county road 1. The old sanatorium was sold to the Osher family on August 1, 1979. The building was torn down and so ends its history. A marker was placed at the end of the old sidewalk that led to the front door of the Sanatorium by efforts of the Historical Society with approval of the County Commissioners who appropriated money for the cost of the marker.""
In 2012 the nursing home (most recently known as the Golden Living Care Center) closed and was sold to a private company. We are unsure of what happened to the monument. [1]

Minnesota,Parkview Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Parkview_Sanatorium,,,1907,Demolished,Single Building,,Hopewell Cottage,"In 1907, Hopewell Cottage opened in Minneapolis to care for up to 20 tuberculosis patients.  Mrs. George H. Christian is given credit for convincing the City of Minneapolis that it needed additional tuberculosis beds, resulting in the construction of Hopewell near the Mississippi River, built on land donated by William Hood Dunwoody. On opening day there were more applicants for admission than the cottage could hold. Fresh air and sunshine were key components of treating the disease in the era before  antibiotics. Hopewell was built in the traditional style. The sleeping areas were on the south side of the building, which had large windows having nothing more than canvas for a covering. The bitterly cold Minnesota winters meant that patients would sleep wearing layers of clothing, under several woolen blankets.
In 1912,  the Minneapolis City Hospital assumed operation of Hopewell and a new three-floor building added 95 beds. The cottage still accommodated 20 people. The first floor of the new hospital housed 15 men and 10 women who were transferred from Mercy/St. Mary's Hospital, the second floor had beds for 33 men, and 33 women could be cared for on the third floor. Hopewell primarily served indigent people with advanced cases of tuberculosis. No wonder, then, that Kathryne Radebaugh, education secretary of the Hennepin County Tuberculosis Association, commented that patients regarded Hopewell Hospital with a “rather chill feeling” and saw it not as a place to go for cure but rather as a place to die.
In 1923 the name was changed to Parkview Sanatorium to better define what type of institution it was. It closed the following year and most patients were transferred to the county sanatorium, Glen Lake at Oak Terrace. The building was used for several years as a non-tuberculosis public charity hospital. The structures were eventually demolished, and the land is now part of the regional park system.

The 35 acre site had facilites for thirty-six patients.  The fee was thirty to fifty dollars per week.  A sanatorium farm supplied all necessary vegetables, meats and dairy products. The facility closed in 1943 and the property was sold to the Redemptorist Fathers to be used as a school for priests.
It was later named ""Pine Manor"" and used for chemical dependency treatment center.  In 1986 it was facing financial difficulties and closed its doors around April 1, of that year.  In 1986 the cost of treatment was $84 per day or $2,000 for the 21 day program.  Comparable treatment in other privately owned centers was $4,000 to $7,000 for the complete program.  The Manor had 53 percent recovery rate for clients, based upon two years of sobriety follow-up studies.",1943,"Grasston, MN",,
Minnesota,Ramsey Tuberculosis Pavilion,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ramsey_Tuberculosis_Pavilion,,,1914,Demolished,Single Building,,Ramsey County Sanatorium,"Tuberculosis control in Ramsey County and the City of Saint Paul began in 1872 with the purchase of a 10-room mansion to house poor people who were sick. Wings were added to the house to provide separate wards for people with contagious diseases. Two doctors, Arthur Ancker and Henry Longstreet Taylor, were responsible for most of the anti-tuberculosis efforts in the city and county. Ancker became superintendent of the hospital in 1883, and Taylor directed the operation of the tuberculosis ward.
When Luther Hospital was opened in 1903 in a building at John and Tenth streets, the tuberculosis patients moved there and Taylor became the medical director. In 1910, the doctor helped open Cuenca Sanatorium on Bass Lake and a summer camp for tuberculosis patients in White Bear Lake. In 1914, a tuberculosis wing, called a pavilion, was added to the new City and County Hospital (later renamed Ancker) which was located on West Seventh Street. The addition was designed with large windows and top floor porches for maximum exposure to fresh air and sunshine. In 1929, an auxiliary unit was opened for additional tuberculosis patients, bringing the total capacity to almost 200 beds. Because of its co-location with the hospital, the Ramsey County Sanatorium focused more on diet and surgical intervention than most other sanatoriums in the state.
By 1951, the tuberculosis wing was mostly unused and part of it was remodeled into a pediatrics department. Tuberculosis patients taking chemotherapy were absorbed into the general patient population.

The Riverside Sanatorium Commission, which controlled the facility, was composed of members from all of the counties involved. Three members, one a physician, were appointed by the Yellow Medicine County Board of Commissioners, and two members were appointed by each of the other counties' boards of commissioners. The sanatorium provided for the care and treatment of resident patients, and also sponsored clinics and various other out-patient services.
Members of the sanatorium staff gave talks before organized groups in the counties, and administered tuberculin tests and X-rays to adults, and to children through the public school system. The Riverside Sanatorium Out-Patient Department was created pursuant to a legislative act that authorized the State Board of Health to grant funds to counties or combinations of counties for establishing and administering local tuberculosis control programs that provided out-patient diagnostic treatment services. The department operated in conjunction with the sanatorium until 1964, when a significant decrease in the number of tuberculosis patients necessitated the closing of the facility.
The commission sold the facility and the outpatient department continued in a new location in Granite Falls, becoming the Riverside Out Patient Clinic. The sanatorium commission continued as the board of directors of the clinic. The clinic, supported by state, county, and private funds, continued to offer tuberculosis testing, former patient follow-up, and consultant services for residents of southwestern Minnesota counties until 1973, when the testing program was discontinued. Following the termination of state aid for out-patient tuberculosis control programs in 1973, the clinic also was

It was renamed soon after opening on December 6, 1916. It started with beds for 26 patients and later expanded to 42 beds. Like the other small sanatoriums, it was hindered from the beginning by its small size and remote location.  Lake Park is 13 miles from Detroit Lakes, the nearest large town.  The train station was almost two miles away from the sanatorium, and the superintendent would use his personal car to pick up patients and visitors who arrived by train. In the years from 1916 to 1945, the facility had 12 different doctors serve as the medical director. A couple of them stayed less than a year.
In April 1951, the county commissioners voted to discontinue the sanatorium and reopen the facility as the Sunnyside Rest Home for the Aged. The Sunnyside Care Center is operated by  Becker County at the site of the former sanatorium. [1]",1951 (as a sanatorium),"Lake Park, MN",,

The act also allowed the cooperation of two or more counties in establishing and maintaining such a sanatorium. Any decision to build and maintain a county sanatorium was, however, subject to the advice and approval of the Commission of the Minnesota Sanatorium for Consumptives.
In 1914, the counties of Cottonwood, Jackson, Lincoln, Lyon, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, and Rock formed an association to build, maintain, and share the services of the Southwestern Minnesota Sanatorium, which was constructed and opened in 1917 on the south shore of Lake Okabena near Worthington in Nobles County. Early in 1918, the sanatorium was forced to close due to an inadequate water supply; however, it reopened in April 1919. The Southwestern Minnesota Sanatorium Commission, which controlled the facility, was composed of members from all of the counties involved. The Nobles County Board of Commissioners appointed three members, one of whom was a physician, while the other counties’ boards of commissioners appointed another two members.
The sanatorium provided for the care and treatment of patients afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis and also provided follow-up services for discharged patients through public health nurses in each county. Members of the sanatorium staff administered tuberculin tests and X-rays to adults, and to children through the public school system. In 1948, the counties of Blue Earth and Watonwan joined the original eight counties in the association, and Le Sueur and Redwood counties joined in 1954.
A significant decrease in the number of tuberculosis patients being admitted to the sanatorium necessitated its closing in 1957. Patients still receiving treatment at the sanatorium were transferred to other facilities in the state for tuberculosis care and treatment. The facility sold the sanatorium commission to the Southwestern Minnesota Crippled Children’s Hospital-School, Inc. (Minn. Stat. 376.54). The sanatorium commission was dissolved in October 1957. The counties of Cottonwood, Jackson, Lincoln, Lyon, and Redwood joined the Riverside Out Patient Clinic in Granite Falls, which administered tuberculosis control programs and provided out-patient diagnostic treatment.
Eugene Wing, a businessman with a child with a disability who attended the Crippled Children’s School in Jamestown, N.D., determined that there were approximately 60 seriously handicapped children who needed education and treatment in the surrounding 12-county area. Wing eyed the buildings and grounds of the shuttered Southwestern Minnesota Sanatorium on Lake Okabena for a hospital-school.
In January 1955, Wing and representatives of the Minnesota Society for Crippled Children and Adults proposed to the sanatorium commission that the buildings be converted to a crippled children’s hospital, a proposal the commission didn’t adopt at the time. Wing then spearheaded formation of a non-profit corporation, Crippled Children’s School, Inc. When the sanatorium ultimately closed in 1957, the commission sold it to the new corporation.
Wing chaired the campaign to raise funds to renovate the old buildings. One of the fundraising brochures emphasized that there were no boarding schools for these children in Minnesota, the children needed special physical training, and for those reasons the public schools weren’t the answer. But the public schools had to be involved, for state policy required that the Worthington Public Schools provide special education services. These special education services, unfortunately, were limited to “educable” children, those with an IQ above 50, because state law didn’t require school districts to serve “trainable” children. Nevertheless, the school served many children with physical disabilities both from the surrounding counties and from throughout the state.
The Worthington Crippled Children’s School, later named the Lakeview School, operated from 1958 until 1996. In the latter years the number of children with physical disabilities decreased, in large part because of changes in federal law.",1957,"Worthington, MN",,
Minnesota,Sunnyrest Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sunnyrest_Sanatorium,,,1916,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Sunnyrest Sanatorium was located about a mile from Crookston, Minnesota, and it served the residents of Polk and Norman Counties. It opened on June 1, 1916 with capacity for 26 patients that later expanded to 60 patients. The head nurse, Hulda Hultquist, reported that her chief difficulty was securing ""good and reliable help."" Although it was a small sanatorium, it played a large part in anti-tuberculosis efforts in northwestern Minnesota. It employed a Field Nurse, opened an outpatient clinic, and affiliated with Bethesda Hospital in Crookston for surgical service. The sanatorium's location in the Red River Valley placed it near sugar beet farms that employed large numbers of workers from Mexico and Texas. In 1933, Sunnyrest's superintendent, Dr. W. G. Paradis, worked with the state epidemiologist to survey 184 migrant workers who remained in the community for the winter. Of those, 88 tested positive with tuberculin skin tests and seven were subsequently found to have active tuberculosis.
In 1954, the counties of Marshall, Roseau, Pennington, and Red Lake were added to the sanatorium district when Oakland Park Sanatorium closed. Sunnyrest remained open until 1967, being one of the last sanatoriums to close. Its outpatient department was remodeled as a tuberculosis outpatient clinic which continued to serve the member counties plus Kittson County. The clinic closed on December 31, 1977.
