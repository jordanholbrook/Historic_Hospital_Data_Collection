Adler was a special program for emotionally disturbed & mentally retarded children. The center opened in 1967 and had an agreement with the University of Illinois at Champaign to conduct research studies on the behavior of various types of disturbed children. The center was closed in 1982 for budget reasons.  The Water Survey Research Center took over the building in 1984 when it outgrew the space it was originally in and transitioning to make this site into the main Water Survey Research Center office site over the next 2 years.

Illinois,Alton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Alton_State_Hospital,1912,1915,1916,Active,Cottage Plan,,Alton Mental Health Center,"In 1909 the General Assembly made provisions for the state to assume all responsibility for the care and treatment of the public insane. To meet the resulting need for more state-operated facilities the General Assembly appropriated funds in 1911 to the Board of Administration for the establishment of another state hospital for the insane. Although construction was not completed at the Alton site until July 1917, forty patients were transferred from Anna State Hospital in December 1916 and housed in temporary quarters until the formal opening of Alton State Hospital.
The Civil Administrative Code of 1917 abolished the Board of Administration and transferred control of Alton State Hospital to the newly created Department of Public Welfare. In 1921 Alton had 757 patients and 117 employees. Three years later Hydrotherapy was introduced and 5 new cottages and 2 new dining halls were completed. A training school for nurses was opened in 1921. In the 1930s a ward was opened for WW1 veterans another for civilian men, one for women and a TB building. Hydrotherapy was becoming a more common treatment at Alton with over 65,000 hours of treatment given in one year.
In the 1940s Electro-convulsive Therapy (ECT) was added and the patient population was 1,775 with a capacity of 1,084. By 1954 the use of new anti-psychotic medications was introduced. Discharge of patients increased by 20% and 39 patients received lobotomies that year. In the '60s Hydrotherapy was no longer used and an adolescent unit was opened. An alcohol treatment unit was opened in 1966 based on the one at Peoria. The Department of Mental Health assumed control of the hospital in 1961 and changed its name to Alton Mental Health Center in 1975. Alton Mental Health center is now primarily a forensic services provider with approximately 200 court-ordered patients. A new high security building was completed in 1997.

The Alton State Hospital Cemetery was established in 1918.  According to the Alton Evening Telegraph, July 31, 1918, twenty people had already been buried in the new cemetery. The land the cemetery is on was part of the old Kirkpatrick farm.",,"East Alton, IL",,"2,100 in 1955"
Illinois,Anna State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Anna_State_Hospital,,1869,1875,Active,Kirkbride Plan,,Clyde Choate Mental Health and Developmental Center | Southern Illinois State Hospital | Choate State Hospital,"Southern Hospital for the Insane, located at Anna, Union County, founded by act of the Legislature in 1869. The original site comprised 290 acres and cost a little more than $22,0000, of which one-fourth was donated by citizens of the county. The construction of buildings was begun in 1869, but it was not until March 1875, that the north wing (the first completed) was ready for occupancy. Other portions were completed a year later. The Trustees purchased 160 additional acres in 1883. The first cost (up to September, 1876) was nearly $635,000. In 1881 one wing of the main building was destroyed by fire, and was subsequently rebuilt; the patients being, meanwhile, cared for in temporary wooden barracks.
The total value of lands and buildings belong to the State, June 30, 1894, was estimated at $738,580, and, of property of all sorts, at $833, 700. The wooden barracks were later converted into a permanent ward, additions made to the main buildings, a detached building for the accommodations of 300 patients erected, numerous outbuildings put up and general improvements made. A second fire on the night of Jan. 3, 1895, destroyed a large part of the main building, inflicting a loss upon the State of $175,000.00. Provision was made for rebuilding by the Legislature of that year. The institution has capacity for about 750 patients.
By the early 1900s the facility had approximately 1,100 patients and 300 staff. In 1920, the Nurses Home was built. By 1923 the facility consisted of 35 buildings on 720 acres of land. In the 1950s and 1960s, the wings of the main building were removed and replaced with the residential units which exist today: Cedar, Cypress, Sycamore, Redbud, Dogwood and Magnolia. By 1968 the facility began providing services for individuals with developmental disabilities. That then turned the hospital into two separate hospitals.  This resulted in the name change for the facility in 1975 to the Anna Mental Health and Developmental Center. In 1988 the facility underwent its last name change to the Clyde L Choate Mental Health and Developmental Center. Clyde Choate received a World War II Medal of Honor for his heroism.  Clyde was also a long-time Southern Illinois legislator and was known as the “Guardian Angel of Southern Illinois.”
Choate received a lifetime achievement award in 1995 for his countless accomplishments and compassion in life. Clyde L. Choate passed away in 2001. As of August 2008 part of the original Kirkbride building still remains. The remaining sections are only the first two floors of the administration and a piece of wing off either side. The upper floors were destroyed by fire. The facility provides jobs to approximately 600 employees and provides services and treatment for mental health, developmental disabilities, dual diagnosis, forensics and forensics step down.

Illinois,Bartonville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bartonville_State_Hospital,,1885,1902,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Peoria State Hospital | Peoria State Hospital for the Incurable Insane | Illinois General Hospital for the Insane | Bartonville Asylum,"Construction on the Bartonville State Hospital began in 1885, and the main structure-an enormous building most closely resembling a medieval castle-was completed in 1887. The building was never used, apparently due to the structural damage caused when the abandoned mine shafts it was built over collapsed. The psychiatric hospital was rebuilt in 1902 under the direction of Dr. George Zeller and implemented a cottage system of 33 buildings, including patient and caretaker housing, a store, a power station, and a communal utility building. Zeller was considered a pioneer of a kinder generation of mental health care, using no window bars or other restraints in his design. In 1907, the name was changed to Peoria State Hospital.
On the hospital's 25th anniversary in 1927, the population was 2,650 with a total of 13,510 patients having entered the facility. During this time, Dr. Zeller was widely respected for his focus on therapeutic efforts. Zeller crusaded for a better public understanding of the mentally ill including inviting newspaper reporters and community members to visit Peoria State. From 1943 until 1969 the hospital participated in a departmental affiliation program for psychiatric nursing which provided instruction in psychiatric nursing to students from regional general hospital nursing schools.
From 1917 until 1961 the hospital was operated by the Illinois Department of Public Welfare. In 1961 the Department of Mental Health was created and assumed responsibility of the institution. At its peak in the 1950s, Bartonville housed 2,800 patients. By 1972 when its closure was announced, the patient census had dropped to 600. After the hospital closed, the buildings stood empty and were auctioned off. When the initial auction buyer went bankrupt, developer, Winsley Durand, Jr., took over ownership with the hope of creating office space in the structures. His plan was never fully realized and the buildings remained empty. Since that time, many of the remaining structures have been demolished and others were renovated to house various commercial and industrial businesses. The Village of Bartonville has established the entire property as a TIF district to encourage further growth and development of the property.
In September 2017 the Bowen Building was torn down so the city could salvage the limestone

Since the closing of the State Hospital, all records have been (and remain) closed. The last body laid to rest was in 1973. The State of Illinois decreed that historians and genealogists can not record the names, birth & death dates of any grave. Over 1500 are identified and those are recorded. But many of the remaining graves bear only a number & the State of Illinois will not release information even under a Court Order to do so.",1972,"Peoria, IL",,"2,800 in 1952"

W.T. Patterson transferred from the staff of Elgin State Hospital to become its first Superintendent. Control of the institution was placed with the Commissioners of the Southern Penitentiary at Menard. The original building on the penitentiary grounds was poorly constructed and was eventually torn down. A replacement was built on a separate campus near Chester, Illinois.
The Department of Public Welfare assumed responsibility for the hospital from 1917 until 1961 when the Department of Mental Health was created. In 1976 new buildings were constructed 1 mile away to replace the aging facility. Many are placed in Chester because they are unfit to stand trial or have been deemed not guilty for various violent crimes by reason of insanity. The original building has been demolished and the hospital moved a short distance to a new campus.

Illinois,Chicago State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chicago_State_Hospital,,,1869,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,,Cook County Institution at Dunning | Dunning Asylum | Dunning Mental Institute | Cook County Institution at Dunning | Read Mental Health Facility | Charles F. Read Zone Center | Chicago Read Mental Health Center,"In 1851 the county poor farm was established at the town of Jefferson, Ill., about 12 miles northwest of Chicago.  The farm consisted of 160 acres of fairly improved land, and was formerly owned by peter Ludby, who located it in 1839.  Additional land was purchased in 1860 and in 1884.  In 1915 the land consisted of 234 acres. By November, 1854, the county poorhouse was nearly finished.  The building was of brick, three stories high and basement, and cost about $25,000.
In 1858 Dr. D. B. Fonda was physician for the poorhouse and insane departments.  At the time the building of the insane asylum, 200 feet south of the almshouse hospital, was contemplated. In the first biennial report of the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities of the State of Illinois, dated December, 1870, occurs the following:
The old insane department was of brick, with small barred windows, iron doors, and heavy wooden doors outside, with apertures and hinged shutters for passing food.  The cells were about seven by eight feet; they were not heated, except by a stove in the corridor, which did not raise the temperature in some of them above freezing point; the cold, however, did not freeze out the vermin with which the beds, walls and floors were alive. The number of cells in this department was 21, 10 on the lower floor and 11 on the upper floor; many of them contained two beds,
The other buildings were all frame; they were more like barns or barracks-immense areas of bare floors, crowded with cheap iron strap bedsteads. The heating was insufficient; there was no ventilation; the arrangements for bathing were so imperfect, there being no hot water, that during the winter months the inmates were not bathed; even in summer the number of tubs was too small and they were inconviently located. There were no halls in these buildings, the entire space being divided into rooms; the stairways were either on the outside or in the center of the room.
In the report for 1878 it is stated that the Cook County poorhouse :is a rookery and should be torn down."" The plans for additional buildings for the infirmary were drawn by John G. Cochrane, the architect, and the designs submitted by him were adopted by the county on the 22d of September, 1881.
The contract for the erection of the buildings was awarded in June, 1882, to Messers. McGraw & Downey, who completed their part of the work in time for the institution to receive inmates by June the following year.
They consisted of nine separate and distinct buildings, connected by corridors arranged in a semi-circular form, with a frontage generally to the south.  In front of the circle were the administration and the four dormitory buildings; immediately in the rear was the central building, and on either side of this the hospitals and dining rooms; in the rear of these were the kitchens and laundry houses, all connected by corridors.  The construction was of brick and three stories in height.
In 1884 the infirmary had accommodations for 1000 patients.  The patients were transferred to the county infirmary at Oak Forest, Ill., in December, 1910, and the buildings of the infirmary were used to house the insane.
In January, 1912, fire destroyed the central portion of the building, which contained six wards, operating room, two congregate dining-rooms, kitchen, chapel and the corridors leading from the was to the west wings.  However, the fire did not destroy the two west wings, which were nor in use, nor the three east wings, which were occupied by the insane patients.  The two west wings were wrecked during the early part of 1913 in order to provide sites for cottage wards 13 and 14.
The east wings continued in use as wards for insane patients until January 9, 1914, when a fire started in the ruins at the western end of the buildings; shortly after this fire the buildings were abandoned and the contract was let to have them wrecked.  The buildings were leveled during the year 1914.
The boiler room and pump house connected with the infirmary remains in use at the present time (1915). The ice-house, which was built at the same time as the infirmary buildings in 1883, is in use at the present time (1915) as a paint shop.
The constantly increasing number of insane cases in the wards of the poorhouse soon made manifest the necessity of providing separate and suitable quarters for this class of county charges.  Accordingly in 1870 the insane asylum was built.  This institution was erected on the county far, a little over a block northeast of the infirmary, on the ground dotted with forest trees and gradually sloping to an artificial lake.  L. B. Dixon, of Chicago, was the architect.
The asylum building had a frontage to the east of 272 feet and was divided by a center building, in which the offices were situated; the two wings were divided into wards.  Each ward was 116 feet long from north to south.  The central building had a frontage of 50 feet.  At each extreme end of wings was a projection 20 feet to the rear for bathroom, water closets and stairs to the yards.  The building was of brick, with cut stone trimmings, and was three stories high above the basement.  Each wing had a center corridor 13 feet wide, with three windows on each end.  The patients' rooms were on each side of the corridors.  Especial pains were taken to secure a thoroughly efficient system of warming and ventilation.  The heating was by high pressure steam, and ventilation was forced by two double-bladed iron fans, eight feet in diameter.  The water closets were at the end of each ward.  The bathrooms were adjoining at the end of each wing.  There was a soiled clothes drop from each bathroom to a room in the basement.  There were two bathtubs and three water closets on each floor.  Each wing had a dining-room on each floor with attendants' each room adjoining.  A dumb waiter extended to the basement from each dining-room.  There was a linen room for each story of each wing near the attendants room.  At the end of each wing there was a separate stairway with separate exits into yards for inmates.
In the rear of the insane asylum at a distance of 100 feet was the laundry building, 60 by 60 feet in size, built of brick with shingle roof two stories above the ground, with a cellar.  This building was divided by a hall through its center with laundry, drying room and ironing rooms on one side, and kitchen and bakery on the opposite side.  The second story was subdivided into apartments for servants employed in rooms below.  This laundry building was connected with the main building by a brick corridor 10 feet wide.
All food for patients in the asylum was brought into the basement of the asylum in an iron car from the rear building, and was carried to the various dining-rooms by a dumb waiter.
The boiler, engine and fan rooms were next to the laundry building and were of brick.  The fuel shed was next to the boiler house and the flour shed in the rear of the laundry building,  The smokestack for the bouler was 85 feet high and 9 feet square at the base.
Pure water was supplied these buildings by an artesian well 756 feet deep.  The cost of these buildings completed was $135,000.  They furnished accommodations for 200 patients, giving a room to each.
In 1871, on account of the overcrowded condition of the hospital, cells were fitted up in the basement. In 1872 a new library was fitted up for the patients at a cost of $500.  One of the large rooms in the rear building was fitted up as a sewing room, and this room was also used for a dance once or twice a week for the patients. In 1873 a fourth story addition was added to the main building for the insane witch was occupied during the early part of January, 1874, as an amusement hall for the patients and quarters for about 50 patients.
In 1874 a piano was purchased for the hall and a bowling alley was fitted up in the basement for the use of the patients.  A reserve reservoir was built, to be used in the event of fire, the two reservoirs in the basement being used to collect rain water from the roofs for use in the boilers.   A gas house was built, which introduced the lighting of the building by gas; and a small infirmary was arranged for on each ward to care for the sick and helpless patients.
During 1877 a new steam drying room was constructed next to the laundry and a new artesian well, 1207 feet deep, was bored. In the report for this year the medical superintendent complained that he was not backed up by the warden, and that he was insulted when he tried to obtain the proper amount of nourishment and its proper preparation for the patients; also that patients were not sufficiently clothed.
In a report made 1878 by the State Board of Commissioners of Public Charities the following occurs:
There was a small amusement hall which would hold 100 persons.  A few books served as a library, but no periodicals were taken.  The upper floors were occupied by women, the lower floors by men.  The pharmacy was in the basement.  There was an icehouse on the grounds holding 300 or 400 tons.  At a little distance from the main building were the barns and piggery.
Dr. John Spray was medical director from January 1, 1878, to September 1, 1882, to September 1,1884. Of the inmates under treatment during March, 1884, there were 285 males and 325 females.  Out of this number only 72 were native-born Americans. Until 1882 the nearest railway station at which on could take the cars to or from the county farm was at the village of Jefferson, two mile away, on the Wisconsin division of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad.  However, the commissioners of Cook County, seeing the necessity of having railroad communication direct for the city, built some three miles of line running across the poor farm in a southerly direction, and intersecting the St. Paul road at Galewood.  This was done and the first train from the city to the county farm was started on the 11th of September, 1882.
The county also erected at its terminus of the line a handsome depot building at a cost of $2100, and the station was named Dunning, in honor of one of the oldest wealthiest settlers in the vicinity. The infirmary and insane asylum up to 1882 were under one management, a committee of five county commissioners, which had entire control.  This committee appointed a medical superintendent over the asylum, a warden, matron, engineer and storekeeper, but none of these officers had any power except as directed by the committee, nor had either institution any head.  Quoting from a report of the State Board of Charities dated 1878: ""The warden is not head, and superintendent is not head; the real head is the committee, which has five heads.""
In 1882 the county board adopted new rules, which provided that the warden and superintendent should be elected by the Board of County Commissioners.  These officers were placed more directly in charge of their respective departments and given enlarged powers of management and control.
This asylum was the first in the West to appoint female physicians.  It was the first in the state to appoint graduate and trained female nurses in charge of the particular nursing and administration of all drugs.  The female physicians were Dr. Delia Howe, appointed May 1, 1884, and Dr. Harriet Alexander, appointed February 1, 1885.
Dr. James D Kiernan was appointed medical superintendent September 1, 1884, and was replaced by Dr. Spray September 1, 1885. The present (1915) detached was buildings were completed in 1885, at a cost of $135,000.  They are two stories in height, built of brick.  A large basement houses at the present time (1915) the general bathroom for patients, with a swimming pool of about 20 by 25 feet; also the carpenter shop, machine shop and mattress shop.
In 1885 there were many complaints made against appointing of employees through the political friendship of the appointing power, which resulted in the presence of many inexperienced and incapable attendants.
Dr. Kiernan, who had been medical superintendent from September 1, 1884, to September 1, 1885, read a paper before the Chicago Medical Society complaining of abuses and mistreatment of patients; and as a result a committee from the State Board of Charities investigated the institution.  Several county commissioners, ex-county commissioners and about 14 contractors were removed by the grand jury.  The heads of the institutions were removed and the institutions were thoroughly investigated, and it was demonstrated that extravagant management and graft existed.
In 1887 the present amusement hall was completed, having been designed as a cottage ward for patients.  This building is two stories in height; the upper floor is used for an amusement hall at the present time, a large stage having been built at the north end of the building.
In 1890 Dr. John A. Benson was medical superintendent.  During this year the present cottage wards 1,2,3 and 4 were completed.  The buildings are built of brick and are two stories and basement high.  A biological laboratory and autopsy house was also erected.  The lower floor of the amusement hall was fitted up as industrial department for re-educational purposes for patients, and a teacher employed to teach industrial arts.  During this year there was only one artesian well in use, which had a flow of 36,000 gallons a day, collected in two cisterns and pumped throughout the buildings.  A pond behind the main building supplied the laundry, but the pond was almost dry and the artesian water supply was low, resulting in not enough water for the proper cleansing and bathing of inmates.
In 1891 Dr. Brown was superintendent, follower by James Pine as warden in 1892.  In 1892 the present cold storage building was completed.  This building is of brick construction and is one story high; it is situated about 100 feet east of the south end of the present store building.
In 1893 Mr Sawyer was warden.  During this year the present (1915) store building was completed.  This building is of brick construction and is about 40 feet by 150 feet, two stories and basement high.  The south end of the building was fitted up and has been used as a drug store ever since.  The present druggiest, Mr. Henry Lindlade, was appointed assistant druggiest February 24, 1894, and was the first civil service appointee as druggiest July 1, 1895.
In 1894 Mr. O. W. Nash was appointed warden; he resigned June 1, 1895, being succeeded by George F. Morgan.  Mr. Morgan remained until January 1, 1897.
On January 2, 1895, the laundry building burned.  The present building was completed in 1896.  It is one story high and of brick construction.
During the year 1895 civil service was instituted, and the control and treatment of patients in the insane asylum was for the first time under the sole management of an able corps of physicians appointed by reason of their fitness.  A medical sepervising staff was appointed September 23, 1895, consisting of Dr. Richard Dewey, Dr. Sanger Brown, Dr Archibald Church, Dr. D. W. Lewis and Dr. William Cuthbertson.  This staff made the rules and regulations for the hospital resident staff.
The hospital grounds were connected with the city water mains by an 8-inch pipe, and fire plugs, with connections, were installed about the grounds.
In  1897 Mr. Albert N. Lange was appointed general superintendent.  It was during this year that the present (1915) cottage wards 5 and 6 were completed.  These buildings are constructed of brick, with a large day room in the center, a dormitory on each side and the dining room in the rear.  The buildings face west and are on the avenue with other cottages.
During 1898 the consumptive hospital was completed.  This building is situated near the southeast corner of the grounds.  It is of brick construction, three stories and attic high.  It has three wings like the letter T and faces south.  The longest wing runs north and south.  However, the west wing is longer than the east wing.  In 1903 this building was remodeled and used for the physically sick insane and continues as such at the present time (1915).
Mr. A. N. Lange resigned as general superintendent November 17, 1902.  On November 30,1902, Dr. John R. Neely was appointed general superintendent.
The working force of the institution was under the supervision of the general superintendent, the assistant general superintendent being in charge of the infirmary.
Dr. John R. Neely resigned as general superintendent June 1, 1903.  In 1903 the present (1915) cottage wards 7, 8, and 9 were completed.  These buildings were known as Group No. 1 and are located at the end of the avenue leading north from the main building for the insane.  The group completes and closes the avenue.  For this reason the Renaissance architectural treatment was employed to mark the middle building.  A large portico is surrounded by a pediment support by Ionic columns, and the apex of the roof of the middle  building marked with a colonial lantern.  A covered colonade or veranda connects the three buildings and provides a passageway for the inmates of the two side cottages to and from the dining-room located in the middle building.  These cottages are faced on all sides with dark red brick and have cut-stone trimmings.  The roofs are covered with re tile.  The ornamental colonade and the veranda are of cement and painted white.  The two cottages on the sides are duplicates.  They are each 100 feet long by 48 feet wide.  On the first floor of each is a large dar room, 42 feet by 48 feet in size, which is lighted on four sides and opens up on the rear.  The middle building is 102 feet long by 31 feet wide.  On the first floor are two dining-rooms, with a common kitchen and serving room.
Dr. V. H. Podstata was appointed general superintendent June 1, 1903, in order to modernize the institution.
A training school for nurses was established.  The pathological department was re-established, with Dr. M. H. McHugh in charge.  The fire department was reorganized and drilled by Captains Figg and Hand, of the Chicago Fire Department.  The county board authorized the appointment of internes.  The cottage in the vicinity of the infirmary which was formerly used for maternity cases and cases of infectious disease was remodeled into a nurses' home; this building was wrecked during 1914.
Mr. George P. Smith was appointed business manager September 18, 1903, as a civil service appointee.
The consumptive hospital built during this year.  It is situated 1500 feet west of the infirmary buildings on the Dunning Farm.  It is of wooden construction and consists of five buildings, connected by spacious corridors, facing south.  The middle building is two stories high and was used as the administration building for offices and living quarters.
In the year 1907 a two-story building was completed at the west end of these buildings and was used asa hospital ward for the more advanced cases of tuberculosis.  There buildings became the property of the State of Illinois July 1, 1912, but the county was allowed the use of them until March, 1914.
In 1904 the hospital staff consisted of, in the insane department, three senior physicians and three internes; in the infirmary, one senior physician and three internes; in the consumptive hospital, one senior physician and two internes.
During this year the present (1915) pathological building and morgue were occupied.  This building is situated about 100 yards south of the main building for the insane.  It is of brick construction, two stories high, and contains a large amphitheater, where clinics are held.  The present farm cottage building was also competed during 1904.  This building is situated near the center of the farm, about 1400 feet west of the main building for the insane.  The building fronts east and back of it are grouped the barns, chicken houses, etc.  The building is 80 feet long, 54 feet wide and two stories in height; there are two one-story extensions in the rear, 27 feet by 22 feet.  The construction is of brick and artistic in appearance.  It was designed to accommodate 45 patients.  At the present time (1915) there are 75 patients housed in the building.
The biological laboratory, which was erected in 1890, was torn down during 1904, when the new building was occupied.
During 1904 the present cottage wards 10 and 11 were completed.  These building were known as Group No. 2, and are situated 125 feet north of the detached ward buildings, facing east.  They consist of two-story cottages and one one-story cottage, connecting the group surrounding a court.  The two larger cottages are 84 feet long by 74 feet deep.  The open court is 58 feet long, enclosed by an ornamental fence.
In 1905 the first graduation exercises of the training school for nurses were held. Dr. V. H. Podstata, general superintendent, resigned July 16, 1906, to become superintendent of the Elgin State Hospital.  Dr. O. C. White was appointed general superintendent, July 16, 1906.  In 1906 hydrotherapeutic and electrical appliances were installed in the west basement of the hospital ward.
In 1907 a psychopathologist was appointed, and semi-weekly meetings of the staff were held for presentation of cases and discussions.  The old picket fence separating the infirmary and insane asylum was torn down; 1500 small trees were purchased and placed in a nursery for transplanting.  A large open ditch, which ran through the grounds, was laid with five 15-inch tile and covered over.
Four 250 horse-power water-tube boilers, equipped with traveling chain grates, were installed in 1907.  Two 500 horse-power boilers were also installed, with traveling chain grates.  A new smokestack, 180 feet high, was built during this year.
A system was developed for re-education purposes for the insane.  Two attendants were sent to the school of civics and philanthropy with pay.  One of these attendants, Miss Myra Henderson, continues at the present time (1915) in the employ of the hospital. A consulting staff of 12 physicians from Chicago was attached to the institution.  Dentist T. W. Schnell visited the hospital one day each week in order to look after the dental needs of the patients.
In 1912 cottage ward No. 1 was established as an art cottage for female patients, in charge of Miss Ingborg Olson, and continues as such at the present time (1915).  A gynecological service was also established. In January, 1912, fire destroyed the central portion of the infirmary buildings, which contained six wards, operating room, two congregate dining-rooms, kitchen, chapel, and the corridors leading from the east to the west wings.  The fire did not destroy the two west wings which were not in use, nor the three east wings which housed insane patients.
In the year 1909 the General Assembly passed a law entitled ""An Act to Revise the Laws Relating to Charities, etc."" Section 20 of this act provided for the removal of the insane and feeble-minded from the county almshouses to state institutions.  All of the provisions of Section 20 were complied with except that part relating to the insane and feeble-minded in almshouses in counties of over 150,000 population.
An appropriation was by the General Assembly in 1911 to provide for the insane and feeble-minded in the Cook County Hospital for the Insane at Dunning, Ill. On July, 1912, the County of Cook transferred to the State of Illinois all lands, buildings and equipment known as the Cook County Institution at Dunning, Ill., the name to be changed to Chicago State Hospital.
The details of the transfer to the state were made by a committee composed of three members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, in joint session with the Board of Administration of the State of Illinois.  The committee of the Board of Cook County Commissioners was composed of Peter Bartzen, ex-officio member, Bartley Berg, chairman, Joseph Mendel and Lawrence J. Coffee.  The state was represented by the Board of Administration.  The appraisement of buildings, lands and furniture was made under the direction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and the valuation is given as follows: Buildings, $983,518.06; $500,640; furniture, $34,970.
On July 1, 1912 Cook County transferred the land, buildings, and equipment of the Cook County Institution at Dunning to the Board of Administration (Board of Administration, Second and Third Annual Reports Springfield, 1913 p. 931). This institution, opened in 1869, had formerly housed the indigent, tubercular, and insane of Cook County. After the Board of Administration assumed control in 1912 the institution was used solely for the treatment and care of the insane and was renamed Chicago State Hospital.
The hospital opened a training school for nurses in 1912 and established the first state psychiatric nursing affiliation program in 1918. The Psychiatric Nursing Affiliation Program provided instruction in psychiatric nursing to students from general hospital nursing schools throughout the country.
The Civil Administrative Code of 1917 transferred control of Chicago State Hospital to the Department of Public Welfare where it remained until the creation of the Department of Mental Health in 1961. In 1970 Chicago State Hospital merged with the Charles F. Read Zone Center to become the Chicago-Read Mental Health Center.
The buildings consisted of the administration building, the detached ward buildings (2), hospital, infirmary buildings, cottage wards 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, farm wards, tuberculosis cottages (6), nurses' cottage, amusement hall, store building, laundry, pathological laboratory and morgue, power house, fire hall, horse barn, cold storage, paint shop, tool house, oil house, smoke house, bay barn, hog shed, slaughter house, chicken house and greenhouses Nos. 1 and 2.
The land consisted of 234 acres and was appraised at $2100 an acre.  Of the 234 acres contained in the track which comprises the site of the hospital, 100 acres are under cultivation.  The soil is black loam, about 14 inches deep, and is peculiarly adapted to the growth of fruits and vegetables.
The State of Illinois assumed charge of the Cook County Insane Asylum July 1, 1912, and the name was changed to the Chicago State Hospital.
When this hospital was taken over by the state Dr. F. B. Clarke, formerly medical director under the county management, was appointed acting superintendent and served as such until the time of his resignation December 15, 1912, when Dr. R. H. Rea became acting superintendent, serving until April 7, 1913.  Dr. George Leininger was appointed superintendent April 7, 1913, and continues as such at the present time.  Dr. H. J. Smith was transferred from the Watertown State Hospital, where he was serving as assistant superintendent, to a like position in this hospital April 17, 1913.  On March 15, 1914, Dr. Smith was transferred to the Peoria State Hospital as assistant superintendent.  Dr. C. F. Read, formerly assistant superintendent at the Kankakee State Hospital, was transferred to this hospital March 16, 1914, as assistant superintendent.  Dr. R. H. Rea remains in the hospital as physician, having served continuously since April 21, 1910.
The medical staff was increased and additional stenographers were added in order to keep complete records of the history, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of each patient.
In December, 1913, a small one-story cottage of brick construction was opened as an unlocked cottage, and accommodates 40 female patients.  This new building is cottage ward No. 12. Cottage wards 13 and 14 were completed and occupied in February, 1914.  Cottage ward 14 is a parole ward and accommodates 125 male patients.  Cottage ward 13 is a closed cottage for male patients.  Both buildings are two stories and basement in height, of brick construction and very pleasing to the eye.  In cottage ward No. 14 a billiard table has been installed and is quite popular with the patients.
The following new buildings are under construction at the present time (1915): An administration building, three stories in height, 187 feet long and 75 feet deep, of brick construction.  It occupies the site of the infirmary buildings which were torn down in 1914.  The building will contain the offices and living quarters of the hospital staff.  Two receiving wards, both identical, of brick construction and two stories in height, one for the female and the other for male patients.  The buildings are 238 feet long by 65 feet deep, and are situated opposite each other on the main driveway to the present administration building.  Two infirmary cottages, to be known as Cottage Ward 15 and 16.  These buildings are of brick construction, two stories in height, and situated just west of the poorhouse boiler room, fronting south on the driveway leading to the old tubercular hospital.
An untidy cottage, on story in height, of brick construction, situated just west of the nurses' home, near the main track of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad. A nurses' home, three stories high, of brick construction, and situated directly west of the present paint shop, facing west.  It is 187 feet long and 75 feet deep and will accommodate about 150 employees.
In the spring of 1914 the buildings which housed the consumptives under county management were thoroughly overhauled, cleansed, disinfected and kalsomined, and are now occupied by insane patients.  The wards in these buildings are known as the detached wards, 5,5A,6,7,8 and 9.  The furnace beating plants have been removed and steam heating is now used. A small root cellar or vegetable house was constructed for $2000.  The building is 60 feet by 40 feet and situated just west of the main building for the insane.
On July 1, 1912, the nursing service consisted of four supervising nurses, 78 male and 72 female attendants.  At the present time (1915) the nursing service consists of one chief nurse, two male supervising nurses, two female supervising nursing, one acting supervising nurse (female), 145 female attendants, 135 male attendants.  In February, 1914, the eight-hour system was installed for the nursing service in part of the hospital, and as it proved a success it was rapidly extended, so that by the middle of May, 1914, all the employees were working on eight-hour shifts.
The present training school for nurses under state management was organized September 1, 1912, at which time 20 pupil-nurses were enrolled, nine of whom remained for the full course and graduated in June, 1914.
Under the supervision of an industrial art teacher, the female patients are instructed in plain sewing, hemstitching, drawn work, embroidery, crocheting, knitting, etc., reed and raffia work, fancy weaving, etc.  The male patients are instructed along re-educational lines under the supervision of a manual training instructor.  The work consists in making brushes, window shades, carpenter work and fret-saw work.  Many patients are employed on the farm and in the garden.
The patients have a weekly dance which they look forward to and enjoy very much.  Moving picture shows have been given.  Entertainments have been given by various fraternal organizations.  Baseball and other games during the summer between patients are held almost daily.  Elaborate entertainments are given on Holidays, e.g., Fourth of July, etc.
Insane patients present in the hospital December 1, 1871, 216; in the hospital March 19, 1915, 3019.[1]
Chicago State Hospital’s buildings closed after it merged in 1970 with the nearby Charles F. Read Zone Center, which had opened on the west side of Oak Park Avenue in 1965. Since 1970, it has been known as Chicago-Read Mental Health Center.

Originally 20 acres and later expanded. An estimated 38,000 people were buried here including unidentified victims of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, Potter's Field, the Cook County poor Farm, Insane Asylum and Chicago State Hospital. Most of the cemetery has been plowed under and used for housing developments, a shopping mall and parking lot, etc. All that is left is an open space called the Read-Dunning Memorial Park with a few fragments of grave markers. No new burials have been added there since sometime in the 1920's.

Illinois,East Moline State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=East_Moline_State_Hospital,1895,1896,1898,Active (As a Correctional Facility),Transition Plan,,Western Hospital for the Insane | Watertown State Hospital | East Moline Mental Health Center | East Moline Correctional Center (Since 1980),"In 1895 the General Assembly established the Illinois Western Hospital for the Insane. A board of three trustees, appointed by the Governor, was instructed to select a suitable site within the northwestern part of the state on which to locate the institution. The board also was empowered to initiate construction plans and after completion oversee the administration of the institution subject to the inspection of the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities.
The trustees purchased land five miles east of Moline in an area known as the Watertown site. The hospital was opened in May 1898 and received its first patients from the Illinois Central Hospital for the Insane at Jacksonville.
The board of trustees and the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities were abolished in 1909 as control of all state charitable institutions passed to the newly created Board of Administration. The institution's name then became Watertown State Hospital.
The Civil Administrative Code of 1917 transferred jurisdiction of the institution to the Department of Public Welfare. When the Department of Public Welfare was abolished in 1961 the Department of Mental Health assumed responsibility for the hospital. In 1975 the institution's name, which had been changed to East Moline State Hospital in 1927, was again altered to East Moline Mental Health Center.
In 1896 the first cornerstone was laid for the main building by governor Altgeld, who is said to have suggested the Gothic style architecture for the main building. Despite the popularity of the new Cottage Plan buildings at Kankakee, the main building at Watertown was a modified Kirkbride. It was called ""the Castle on the Mississippi"". January 1898 the front wards opened and accepted 336 patients from Jacksonville. By that spring it was fully opened and had a population of just over 600 patients.
In the beginning the basement of the main building housed the carpentry shop, kitchen, bakery, laundry and paint shop. By 1905 the new 75 bed infirmary, cottages and tent colony for TB patients were completed. More projects were finished by 1910 including a 1,000 seat theater, a separate chapel and the amusement/recreation hall with capacity for 1,500. It had gymnastic equipment, pool tables, sewing rooms, 3 bowling alleys and held concerts & dances weekly.
By 1935 the hospital included 43 separate buildings on 673 acres (including farmland) and had a little over 2,000 patients. A study in 1978 suggested closing the facility, and in 1980 it's remaining 260 patients were moved to Galesburg Mental Health. The Illinois Department of Corrections took over the property and currently uses it as a minimum security facility.
The Illinois State Archives holds records for this facility. There are some restrictions for privacy reasons. A list of their holdings for East Moline Mental Health Center - RG 262 is at at this link.

Illinois,Elgin State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Elgin_State_Hospital,1869,1870,1872,Active,Kirkbride Plan,Stephen Vaughn Shipman,Northern Illinois Hospital for the Insane | Illinois Hospital for the Insane | South Elgin State Hospital | Elgin Mental Health Center,"On December 28,1869, the Board of Trustees met to examine the nine plans that had been submitted from various architects for the new asylum. The Board had enlisted the aid of two prominent superintendents to act as advisers. One was Dr. Andrew McFarland, M.D., the Superintendent of the state hospital in Jacksonville. The other was Dr. Richard J. Patterson, M.D., former superintendent of state hospitals in Indianapolis, Indiana and Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Interestingly, the building design of the Jacksonville hospital was largely based on that of the Indiana State Hospital, and is an example of the increasingly common practice of copying designs from one hospital for use at another.
The original name of the Elgin Mental Health Facility (its current name) was The Northern Illinois Hospital and Asylum for the Insane. The doors opened in 1872, however, construction of additional buildings continued until 1874. A rumor circulated for year, and still exists that the State of Illinois approached the City of Elgin with plans to construct a mental institution and a college and offered Elgin one or the other. As the rumor goes, Elgin took the mental institution, De Kalb took Northern Illinois University. As Elgin Historian and celebrated Elgin History author, Bill Briska points out the rumor, ""...is totally false"" He goes on to state that, ""The state hospital was founded in 1869 and the college in 1892. (there are) No connection between the events"".
The man-made lake was added in 1886. It was 400 by 500 feet in area and was designed to create a tranquil atmosphere for the patients and employees, as well as provide extra water for fire protection. The decision to construct the Annex Building was a milestone in many ways, not only for the Northern Hospital, but also for the Central and Southern Hospitals (located at Jacksonville and Anna) which erected identical buildings. It was also a milestone in the State's history of providing care for the mentally ill. The decision marked a major turning point in the debate over how large hospitals should be and what types of patients would be served. Within a short time, it would become the home of over 1,000 additional patients. It was closed in 1960 and razed in 1972 with the Kirkbride being torn down in 1994.
By 1896, the facility averaged more than one new patient and one discharge daily, up threefold from the 1880's rate. In 1896, the recovery rate was listed as 53% of admissions, the highest ever. Starting with a predictable daily routine, patients were awakened at 5 AM in summer and 5:30 AM in winter. Breakfast was served at 7 AM. Dinner, the main meal of the day, was served at noon. Supper was at 6 PM. Bedtime was 9 PM year round.
Since work was considered an important part of treatment, most patients participated in some form of it. In 1884 to 1886, about 63 percent of patients were engaged in some type of work related activity at one time or another during their stay. Men generally worked on the farm and maintained the grounds. A few were employed in the various workshops. Women were most frequently assigned to help in the kitchen, laundry, and sewing rooms. Both sexes engaged in ""ward work,"" which consisted of cleaning and maintaining the living areas of the wards. Patients generally worked only a small portion the day. A very few patients were paid wages comparable to employees. For most patients, however, the work was uncompensated. In keeping with the prevalent attitudes of the day, the labor contributed by patients was seen as one means by which they could help cover the cost of their stay. Throughout the nineteenth century the purpose of work was clearly defined as therapeutic and not for the economic benefits of the hospital. Work was a means to combat idleness, instill values, and test a patient's ability to resume responsibility. It was one indicator of discharge readiness.
Superintendents became leery of a class of attendants they called ""hospital tramps."" The term tramps referred to the fact that employees moved from hospital to hospital seeking jobs as attendants. Their moves were often prompted by firings and disciplinary actions against them. Before the Civil Service Commission was established in 1908, state hospitals lacked a centralized personnel system to keep track of these undesirable individuals. Tramps further hid their identity by using assumed names. By the 1890's, many hospitals had established training programs for new employees. However, these varied widely in quality and scope.
Under Dr. Whitman's administration, a 110 bed infirmary for female patients was erected. This building opened on December 11,1900. The women's infirmary was attached to the north
wing of the Center Building and became known as ""D North"". The hospital's maximum bed capacity now reached 1210, although the actual census tended to be slightly less. The basement of the new building contained the long sought after morgue. The Center Building continued to undergo other transformations. The chapel was converted into dormitories for employees
and the amusement hall was enlarged in size. By 1902, the hospital grounds included 25 detached buildings ranging from the Center Building and Annex to patient cottages, employee
residences, farm buildings, workshops and several other structures such as an ice house, a bath house, and sheds.
In early fall 1908, two identical cottage buildings were completed and occupied by patients. Both buildings were intended for fifty patients. The buildings were two story brick cottages, designed in the relatively new architectural style known as the Prairie School. These were modestly scaled buildings but contained very large rooms. The sleeping quarters were open dormitory style with the dayroom making up most of the rest of the space. Unlike the Center Building, there were no private bedrooms, sitting rooms, parlors, small dining rooms or other areas to make the living space more homelike. The new buildings, while modest in overall size, were a forerunner of larger buildings that would follow with their cavernous dorms and dayrooms. The large dorms and dayrooms would sacrifice the privacy and individuality of patients for economy of construction and the potential to add extra beds if needed.
On June 1, 1912 work began on a new bakery and a morgue/laboratory. The original powerhouse, was attached to the rear of the Center Building. In 1916, a new powerhouse was constructed in a building detached from the Center Building; this provided for better fire protection. The powerhouse building is still in use today. The space vacated by the move allowed the kitchen to be rebuilt and expanded. The laundry was also moved from the Center Building to a free standing structure. Between 1912 and 1914, in the southeast corner of the campus, five new buildings were erected; four buildings were wards and the fifth was a dining hall. On May 1,1912, a new building opened to receive female admissions. Originally called the Women's Psychopathic Building, it became known as Dix Cottage, named for the nineteenth century reformer Dorthea Dix. The Dix Building was a two story structure designed with single and double rooms and semiprivate baths. One month after Dix opened, construction began on the Loewy Cottage, named after former Superintendent Dr. Arthur Loewy.
As the construction boom progressed from 1910 to 1917, left over building materials were often recycled by the hospital's tradesmen and their patient laborers. This resulted in the construction of new farm buildings and the remodeling of other structures for new or expanded use. One such project was the 1917 remodeling of the old powerhouse into a dormitory for women. Another was the demolition of the Burr conservatory and its replacement with another conservatory building in 1916.
After the war ended in 1918, the hospital's construction program resumed. Ultimately, the 1920's saw the hospital's most spectacular period of growth in terms of buildings, bed space, and acreage. The first major building erected was a new medical hospital. This building opened in 1921 and was equipped with a pharmacy, laboratories, an X-ray machine and a kitchen. There were two patient wards of 26 beds each, plus an additional nine rooms for sick employees. The building included a surgical suite. The state employed a surgeon who would travel from hospital to hospital. The new hospital building was a model of modern construction and accommodations. It had been designed by the state architect and used at other state hospitals.
Over the next two decades, scores of buildings were erected at Elgin State Hospital and other state institutions. Almost all of these buildings were designed by the state architect. The strategy was to develop a standard set of plans, therefore the buildings erected at Elgin State Hospital had a similar appearance to one another as well as to those at other state facilities. In addition to being a cost cutting measure, the intent was to give the grounds the look of a college campus.
The General Hospital opened in 1921 and was the first of several buildings designed in the Georgian architectural style. The building was a medical hospital equipped with X-ray machines, a surgical suite, its own kitchen, two wards for patients and nine rooms for sick employees. The grounds now consisted of nearly 40 major buildings. Interestingly, one patient who had been admitted in April of 1872 still remained.
In 1929, the Illinois State Psychopathic Institute relocated to the grounds of Elgin State. Ten new buildings were staffed and occupied by June 1932, and Dr. Read presided over 3779 patients in house, and a few hundred more on parole. Despite the Depression, improvements to the grounds continued, although the pace of construction slowed. Some of the work
involved projects that were planned prior to the stock market crash. One such project was a new hospital building for veterans. This building replaced the small hospital attached to Wilson Cottage. The new building opened in January 1931 and was eventually named Halloran Cottage, after Dr. Roy C. Halloran, M.D., the first chief of military psychiatry for the United States government. The basic floor plan of the building was attributed to Dr. Hinton.
In September 1937, a new infirmary ward opened. The building was named Gahagan Cottage after the former superintendent. A new ""E"" shaped cottage opened on the north end of the
grounds. This building was named Hawley Cottage after a former Assistant Superintendent. A major addition to the campus was the Christmas Day 1935 dedication of a new Assembly Hall. Superintendents as far back as the 1890's had been asking for a larger assembly hall. The original hall was constructed as part of the Center Building. Its seating capacity was based on a 450 bed hospital. Remodeling had enlarged the hall but, by 1935, the hospital's census was over 4300. Consequently, many large gatherings were held in an outdoor area behind the Center Building known as the Quadrangle. This area was paved over, and could seat up to one thousand. Movies, dances, receptions and concerts were regularly held in this space. Other uses included roller skating and bowling.
Elgin State Hospital's population had grown steadily with the addition of the new buildings. The census rose from 3172 in 1929, to 4433 in 1936, to 5253 in 1940. Despite the massive construction program, the hospital was seriously overcrowded on several wards by 1941.
By 1949, the census was 6,025. In 1955, the average daily census was 7,644, its peak number of patients. Through the years, the hospital was often involved with notable research in medical and behavioral advances and served as a training ground for many physicians and other disciplines as mental health services were coming of age. In the early 1950's, with the advent of major pharmacological treatment alternatives, the move to deinstitutionalize mental health services began and, by 1965, the hospital’s average daily bed census dropped to 5.
In 1975 the name was changed to Elgin Mental Health Center. Elgin’s average daily census dropped to 3,319 by Fiscal Year 1970. Throughout the 1970's, with the rapidly changing scientific, social, civil rights and political forces of the community mental health movement, the inpatient population was reduced further. Today only a handful of the older buildings have survived, mostly the ""E"" shaped cottages built in the 1930s.
The Center Building was first advertised for construction bids in early 1870. The north wing was constructed first with occupancy in 1872. Construction on the
center section and south wing was commenced soon after with a completion date of July 30, 1874. The December 28, 1869 report of the Medical Superintendent at the Northern Illinois Hospital states that Stephen Vaughan Shipman was selected from a field of nine architects interviewed by Drs. McFarland and Patterson. Later, in the third biennial Report in 1874, it was said of Col. S. V. Shipman that “...we believe this plan combines good taste, convenience, comfort and health, with economy.” The report goes on to say that “...we have found Col. Shipman a gentleman of ability, strict integrity and loyalty to the state, and a complete and competent master of his profession in designing and constructing insane asylums – his plan proving to be all we anticipated when it was adapted.” Before moving to Chicago, he designed the Central State Hospital for the insane, the old Dane County Courthouse and the American Exchange Bank in Madison. He also designed the Northern State Hospital for the Insane in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
Bids were due from general contractors on April 16, 1870 for construction of the north wing of the Center Building. A bid of $124,000 from the W. F. Bushnell &
Co. of Mendota was uncomfortably close to the $125,000 appropriated by the state legislature. The trustees of the Northern Illinois Hospital brought the situation to the attention of Illinois Governor John M. Palmer who gave the approval to proceed. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 severely hampered progress on the north wings.
Its flames consumed the stock of John David & Company, subcontractor for the hospital heating plant. Reordering the equipment delayed admission of the first
patients until April 3, 1872. Lack of heat did not postpone formal opening and inspection of the building, however, and the ceremony took place on an icy
February 2, 1872.
Dr. Edwin A. Kilbourne, Superintendent of the new Northern Illinois Hospital, quickly set about convincing the legislature to appropriate funds for completion of
the center and south wings of the building. He reported that the north wings could accommodate 182 patients, rather than the expected 150. Citing economy of
scale, he argued that he could not begin classifying patients into proper treatment groups with less than half of his facility completed. Appropriations for completing the hospital building were approved, and bids were received for the center section and south wings on June 16, 1873. Two days later, a $206,000 contract for construction was awarded to Fish Stephens and Sorenson of Madison, Wisconsin. The contractor broke ground on July 1, 1873 and completed the massive building
by July 30, 1874 – a period of just 13 months. The Northern Illinois Hospital and Asylum for the Insane, north, south and center sections, was finally complete at a
total cost of $330,000. The legislature, however, while appropriating money for remaining construction, neglected to provide funds for the care of the additional
residents. The newly-completed sections stood vacant until April 1, 1875. The dome over the central section held iron tanks which supplied water to the toilet and bathrooms of the entire Center Building.[1] The building was long and linear in nature which allowed for a high ratio of window to floor space. This represented a departure in style since most asylums tended to be smaller and quadrangular in design. The front facade of a Kirkbride building typically measured more than 700 feet long with some versions up to three times this length. The frontage of the Center Building was 1086 feet.
Each wing was divided into three or more sections which contained the individual wards. Despite the huge length of the building, each of the wards was relatively small in size, about 100 feet long and about 36 feet wide. A single ward typically housed about 10 to 25 patients, with the smaller numbers on the ""noisy"" units. Patient rooms were located on both sides of a central corridor, much like a hotel. There was a parlor area in the center of the ward. The parlor faced outdoors and included a large bay window. This allowed air and light to penetrate the center of each ward. Good air circulation was encouraged by the ample number of windows and the positioning of units in echelon fashion. Setting each ward back from its adjacent ward allowed the ends of the corridors to be open, via windows, to the outside; this allowed for cross ventilation.
The wards designated for noisy patients, who were more apt to be confined to their bed rooms, had rooms on only one side of the corridor. Kirkbride believed that in addition to the window in the room, these confined patients should be able to peer out the windows on the opposite side of the hallway, thus lessening the feeling of seclusion.
Another linear Kirkbride building, called the Annex, was added in 1891. The Annex was the last building of the congregate type to be constructed on the grounds. Future buildings for patients were to be separate cottages, designed to house 100 each. The Annex was demolished in the 1970's.

History of Elgin Mental Health Center with Bill Briska
The mental health center opened Hillside Cemetery in 1933 to provide the facility's unclaimed dead a final resting place. Bodies were buried in simple wooden caskets often paid for by the state. When no family members showed up for burial, center staff often served as pallbearers or helped lower the caskets into the ground. No one has been buried in Hillside since the mid-1980s. The cemetery contains the graves of almost 1,000 patients.

Consisted of 118 brick buildings connected by 1.5 miles of enclosed corridors on a 155 acre plot of land. Contained 2,350 beds and reached a population of 3,000 while under military control. Among those that worked there, 160 German POWs. In 1946 the hospital was declared surplus and turned over to the state of Illinois. In 1949 the state turned it over to the Department of Public Welfare and patients began arriving in November 1950, most of those were from the overcrowded Manteno and Kankakee State Hospitals. In 1955 Dr. Harold Himwich developed the drug Chlorpromazine at Galesburg.
The hospital was planned to primarily care for elderly patients and develop a major research program. By 1960 the hospital began accepting patients of all ages and a focus on alcoholism treatment. The hospital used all types of treatment during it's history including ECT and insulin shock therapy. Patient population peak reached 3,000 by the late 1950s. The hospital was closed in 1985 and research programs moved to Chicago. The remaining 300+ patients were moved to other state hospitals. Today many of the buildings remain, owned by private businesses under the name of Hawthorne Center.

The State Criminologist acted as director of the Institute for Juvenile Research until 1941 when the Division of the Criminologist was transferred to the Department of Public Safety. The institute, however, then was made an independent division within the Department of Public Welfare and was specifically empowered to conduct scientific studies and to diagnose and promote the treatment of mentally ill, socially maladjusted, or delinquent children.
The institute, located in Chicago, also operates the William Healy School as an inpatient unit, provides child guidance services to children and their families, and trains personnel in these fields.

The board of trustees sent M.C. Goltra to Indianapolis to obtain copies of the plans for the hospital that had just started construction there. Thus the architectural plans for the Kirkbride plan building were a copy of an asylum just begun there. The Central Indiana State Hospital for the Insane would open and accept it's patients first on November 21st 1848. The hospital and Jacksonville added several wings between 1848 and 1875.
In 1860 the hospital had 30 cases of typhoid fever with 3 deaths. This was due to a lack of a clean water supply. Dorthea Dix lobbied for funds to fix the problem and in 1862 the hospital received a 2,500,000 water reservoir and a new pumping station. 	The board of trustees was abolished in 1909 when executive and administrative control of all state charitable institutions passed to the newly created Board of Administration. As part of the reorganization the institution was renamed the Jacksonville State Hospital. The Civil Administrative Code of 1917 transferred jurisdiction of the hospital to the Department of Public Welfare.
For 1944-1974 the hospital participated in a departmental affiliation program for psychiatric nursing which provided instruction in psychiatric nursing to students from general hospital nursing schools. The Psychiatric Nursing Affiliation Program offered two-, three,- and four-month terms of classroom instruction and practical training at Jacksonville State Hospital.
In 1961 the Department of Mental Health assumed responsibility for Jacksonville State Hospital and in 1974 expanded the hospital's duties to include treatment for the developmentally disabled. To reflect this change in function the institution's name became the Jacksonville Mental Health and Developmental Center in 1975.
Today the facility houses developmentally ill patients. Most of the original buildings, including the Kirkbride, have been demolished. In November, 2012 the last patients were moved out and the buildings/property were declared surplus property.

Kirkbride Plan",,Illinois Eastern Hospital for the Insane | Kankakee Developmental Center | Kankakee Mental Health Center | Governor Samuel H. Shapiro Development Center,"On May 25, 1877, the Illinois Legislature approved the building of a new hospital to serve the eastern part of the state. The legislation directed Gov. Shelby Cullom to appoint a group of seven commissioners who would choose a location for the new institution. Selection of the commissioners involved regional rivalries and other political considerations; the final makeup of that group could be vital in determining which town would be chosen. Many cities offered inducements by way of donations, for the location of the new hospital but the site finally selected was a farm of 250 acres near Kankakee, and this was subsequently enlarged by the purchase of 327 additional acres in 1881.
Work was begun in 1878 and the first patients received in December 1879. the plan of the institution is, in many respects, unique. It comprises a general building three stories high capable of accommodating 300 to 400 patients and a number of detached buildings, technically termed cottages, where various classes of insane patients may be grouped and receive the particular treatment best adapted to ensure their recovery. The plans were mainly worked out from suggestions by Frederick Howard Wines, LL.D., then Secretary of the Board of Public Charities, and have attracted generally favorable comment both in this country and abroad.
The seventy-five buildings occupied for the various purposes of the institution, cover a quarter section of land laid off in regular streets, beautified with trees, plants and flowers, and presenting all the appearance of a flourishing village with numerous small parks adorned with walks and drives.
The counties from which patients are received include:
Cook, Champaign, Coles, Cumberland, De Witt, Douglas Edgar, Ford, Grundy, Iroquois, Kankakee, La Salle, Livingston, Macon, McLean, Moultrie, Piatt, Shelby, Vermilion and Will. The whole number of patients in 1898 was 2,200 while the employees of all classes numbered 500.
For the first quarter-century of its existence, the hospital grew steadily in both physical facilities and patient population. The first patient was admitted on Dec. 4, 1879; by Jan. 1, 1880, the patient population was 33. The patient population had risen to 2,300 by 1903, with more than 700 people (including eight physicians) providing treatment and support services. By 1903, the original dozen or so buildings had increased to nearly 50. The large central clock tower building, with multi-story wings on each side, housed hundreds of patients as well as hospital offices and living quarters for physicians. Twenty-six large stone cottages provided housing for from 24 to 173 patients each; 15 housed male patients, and 11 were reserved for female patients. More than two dozen additional structures served various support functions and employee housing.
In 1975 the hospital became the center for care and treatment of the developmentally disabled and all other patients were moved elsewhere. The Kirkbride houses offices & a small number of elderly patients.
This hospital started out planned as a Kirkbride, but was changed to a cottage plan while it was still being planned and built.  It has been argued that this hospital was the first cottage plan to be built.  Yet, some of the buildings on the campus do have building/ground styles that can be attributed to the Kirkbride plan.

Charles H. Hammond",Manteno Mental Health Center,"The Illinois Legislature in 1927, under the administration of Len Small, voted to build a new institution for the mentally ill as Kankakee and Chicago State Hospitals were becoming overcrowded. Appropriations for the land and original buildings for a new ""insane"" hospital were handled by the State Department of Public Welfare. Having in mind that a large proportion of people committed to asylums came from Cook county, a location was chosen close to Chicago and yet outside of the area of high-priced land. A site was chosen near the village of Manteno. 1,000 acres were acquired in a location near the town. Plans were drawn for construction of an administration building first, followed by 100 patient cottages. The contracts were awarded December 8th, 1928.
The fact that an Illinois Central depot was located in the village of Manteno and highway 50 was completed near the site had a great deal to do with the location. In his Biennial message of 1929, Governor Len Small announced in his building report that the hospital was under construction. The cost of the administration building and 8 2-story cottages at the time was $1,172,073. The 8 two-story cottages at Manteno State Hospital were part of the original architectural plan and were the first cottages built for patients in 1928. At this time it is unclear as to when or why the architecture of the additional cottages was changed to the one-story ""H"" plan after 1929. Dedication ceremonies were led by the Governor on November 21st, 1929. The two-story cottages were used as alcoholic and voluntary wards in the 50s and 60s, but were closed by the 1970s. There are many contributing factors as to why these buildings were eventually closed. It may have been too easy for suicidal patients to leap from the top of the inner staircases, access may have been too difficult for the elderly or infirm or that interior access to their basements (eventually leading to the tunnel system) proved to be too dangerous.
On the morning of December 27th, 1930, a train arrived in Manteno carrying 100 male patients from Kankakee and Chicago State Hospitals. Fifteen staff members from the hospital were there to greet them. Dr. Ralph Hinton was the first administrator and many people who lived in Manteno rushed to apply to work at the newly built institution. Manteno State Hospital gave jobs to many people during the Great Depression.
By 1939 Manteno State Hospital had grown to twice the size of Kankakee State Hospital. There were 5,385 patients on the census for that year. In the late spring a typhoid epidemic swept through the hospital causing 60 deaths and over 400 seriously ill. Despite the news of the epidemic, the patient population continued to grow. Dr. Hinton introduced a concept, also used by Kankakee State Hospital; where patients were used to work the hospital farmland. Working the farm as part of their on-going therapy was crucial to their rehabilitation. The idea was used throughout the US at other hospitals with success.
By 1940 the hospital was one of the largest of its kind in the country. Also in that year, Dr. Walter Baer was named the new superintendent and continued to oversee the growth in the number of patients and crops from farming. He also introduced recreation and entertainment (the recreation building was later named for him, Hinton Hall). This included concerts and dances composed of patients, staff and members of the community.
The years during WW2 were very difficult for staffing and the budget. The ratio of staff to patient plummeted and were the worst in the hospital's history. By 1949 the patient population skyrocketed to 6,926; while the institution was built to accommodate a maximum of 5,000. Treatments continued to be occupational and activity oriented. Intensive treatment was carried out on about 2,000 patients a year, this included shock therapy and lobotomies. The farm cultivated over 900 acres through the late '40s.
In the 1950s Manteno State Hospital was at it's height. The patient population reached 8,185 in 1954, the 4th largest in the nation. Most new patient admissions were now brought in by a state run bus instead of railroad. It made the trip from Cook County Psychopathic hospital to Elgin, Kankakee and Manteno. It was painted Robins Egg blue, earning it the nickname ""Bluebird"".
New admissions went directly to the Diagnostic building, aka the Singer building. Here they would go through a process of showering, new clothes treatment for vermin if needed. They would then spend days or sometimes weeks there for a psychological assessment before being transferred via underground tunnels, to either one of the cottages or the farm colony for those with less needs or concerns.
Over the next 3 decades the hospital changed greatly. Patient population declined rapidly and new therapies were introduced. Most of the 1960s Manteno State Hospital found itself in many scandals and investigations. Some found to be true, others false. In 1983 it was suggested that the hospital be closed due to budgetary reasons and in 1985 it closed it's doors for good. The north half of the campus was turned over to the Veterans Administration (VA) for housing elderly veterans, and remains in use by them today. The southern half now has a mix of light industrial, single family homes, and a group recovery home for troubled youth. The redevelopment has being bought by private groups, most by the Diversatech group. Diversatech group demolishing many of the 1 & 2-story cottages due to public safety concerns and disrepair.

Information taken from National Register of Historic Places paperwork
In 1936, through the Federal Art Project, Manteno State Hospital secured a number of murals for the lobby of the Administration Building. These murals have a historic setting and are based on a poem by Oliver W. Barnard who was at one time the owner of the land, which now comprises the campus of the institution.  The murals were the work of former Chicago Art Institute student, Gustaf Oscar Dalstrom, who later became President of the Chicago Society of Artists and whose paintings, in 1939, were loaned to the White House at the request of President and Mrs. Roosevelt.

The pioneer of biochemical therapy, Dr. Carl C. Pfeiffer was a research consultant at Manteno State Hospital in the 1950s. Dr. Pfeiffer wrote many books and papers about nutrition and its relation with mental health.  His most notable book, Nutrition and Mental Illness: An Orthomolecular Approach to Balancing Body Chemistry, written in 1987 is still very popular today.In 1973, he opened the Brain Bio Center in Princeton, New Jersey where during his research he found that many psychological problems could be traced to biochemical imbalances in the body. The Center developed series of tests to determine the various biochemical imbalances, which could then be treated with orthomolecular therapy.

A patient experience at Zeller was different from traditional state hospital treatment.

A day care unit deflected many from inpatient care. Therapeutic programs included individual and group psychotherapy, video therapy, occupational and recreational therapy and, infrequently, ECT.

Patterson, a renowned expert in the field of mental health. Patterson was one of the first to believe that peace, quiet, and gentleness were beneficial to the cure of those who were mentally ill. He purchased the old school and made it into a sanitarium for disturbed ladies. Dr. Patterson's wife was the matron, and there were a dozen attendants and nurses on staff. Patterson furnished the old school rooms with carved beds, huge ornate chests, and other furniture and renamed it Bellevue Place. In 1871, he added the two-story wings with the mansard roofs. He could then increase his patient load to 25-30 women at one time in the home. Orchards and a vegetable garden provided a fresh supply of in season food for the institution. Around the grounds were flower beds, hammocks and lawn seats, which spoke of outdoor life and freedom.
In the 1960s, the building was converted to a residential facility for unwed mothers called the Fox Hill Home. The Fox Hill Home operated into the 1970s when the building fell into disrepair. In the middle of the 1980s, the building was once again named Bellevue Place and converted into apartments.
In 1875, a Chicago court deemed that Mrs. Lincoln behaved irrationally. It was ordered that she be placed in a mental hospital. Her son Robert brought her to Batavia on the train to Dr. Patterson's sanitarium. If the legends of Mary's stay are correct, she was not very confined. She is said to have visited in several of the homes around Bellevue, to have eaten her meals with Dr. and Mrs. Patterson, and to have visited friends in St. Charles.
The third floor of the sanitarium housed the most serious cases, and the first floor was the most desirable and thus most expensive. Mrs. Lincoln stayed on the second floor. Her estate was charged $10 a day for her room.

The Hope School was founded by Dr. and Mrs. Charles E. Jordan, parents who were desperate to find a place to educate their daughter, Judith Ann, who had multiple developmental disabilities.  There was no school within the United States which could help Judith to reach her full potential, and so the Jordans started their own in 1957.
The Hope School provided a successful and long-term solution for children with developmental disabilities.  It is so successful, in fact, that President John F. Kennedy appointed Dr. Jordan to various governmental councils on disabilities.  Dr. Jordan helped to gain attention and provide a voice and a new reality for children and adults living with disabilities.  In so doing, he established The Hope School as a national leader in the field.

Construction on the large, three-story building started in 1903 and was completed in 1905. The sanitarium was built on ten acres of land and included six suites, with six to seven bedrooms in each suite. The sanitarium boasted modern conveniences such as electric lights, telephones, and an elevator. Because the sanitarium housed patients who were sent there on court orders, sections of the house were locked wards with barred windows. Despite these precautions, there are records of patient escapes published in local newspapers. Patient suicides were also a problem, with one patient jumping from a third-floor window after running away from guards.
After Dr. Brown's death in 1928, his wife and son took over running the sanitarium. After Mrs. Brown passed way in 1939, the sanitarium was sold and became known as Maryhaven, a Roman Catholic nursing home and retirement center. In the 1960s, Maryhaven was moved to a new location, and the original building was demolished.

For 40 years, developmentally disabled children lived, went to school, and learned work skills on the grounds of the Palos Park campus. In 1989, St. Coletta’s of Illinois took a great leap forward by relocating the Kennedy School to a vacant public school building in Palos Hills.

Illinois,Norbury Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norbury_Sanatorium,1901,,1901,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Maplecrest  | Maplewood | Norbury Sanitarium,"Dr. Frank Parsons Norbury (1863 – 1939) founded The Norbury Sanatorium in 1901 in Jacksonville, Illinois, for the treatment of nervous and mental diseases. Dr. Norbury wanted to establish a more defined and individual private care for patients having mental and/or nervous disorders who could not be received in general hospitals or receive proper care at home.
Dr. Norbury graduated from Long Island College Hospital, Brooklyn, in 1888. His began his medical career as a resident physician on the staff of the Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children at Elwyn. He focused his graduate work in neuropathology and clinical neurology. He then became a resident staff of the Illinois Central Hospital for the Insane (now the Jacksonville State Hospital), where he served for five years. In 1893, decided to go into private practice and became an attending physician at Oak Lawn Retreat, a private institution for mental and nervous diseases before opening the Norbury Sanatorium.
The sanatorium began in a single building with accommodations for fifteen patients at a Southern Colonial style home on 806 South Diamond Street. The home was remodeled to meet the requirements of hospital service and room for fifty patients. The first patient was admitted on August 11, 1901.
The sanatorium quickly outgrew the property on South Diamond Street and expanded to a neighboring property on 1631 Mound Avenue. This building, called “Maplecrest,” was also remodeled to four units containing 10 rooms each and private baths. Maplecrest housed the female patients and administrative offices, while the original sanatorium building, now called “Maplewood,” housed male and custodial patients. Hydrotherapy, electroshock therapy, occupational therapy, X-rays, and diathermy (a medical and surgical technique involving the production of heat in a part of the body by high-frequency electric currents, to stimulate the circulation, relieve pain, destroy unhealthy tissue, or cause bleeding vessels to clot) were located in Maplecrest's sub-basement.
A diagnostic clinic was also established at the Norbury Sanatorium. Reports from the diagnostic clinic were shared with family physicians, public schools, social agencies, and juvenile and criminal courts, and was focused on making recommendations for the care of children suffering from mental and nervous disorders.
Maplecrest sat on 31 landscaped acres. Additional buildings included a nurses’ home, heating plant, and laundry. Recreation was offered to both male and female patients. The sanatorium grounds included tennis courts, orchards, gardens, and a chicken farm.
Nurses employed at Norbury Sanatorium were first sent to train in cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore in order to study “most modern technic and facilities offered in the specialized services in those medical centers.”
Mentions of the sanatorium in medical publications and newspapers were difficult to find after the early 1960s. A 1967 newspaper notes the sale of the property, so it seems the sanitorium closed in the mid-1960s, though an exact year is unknown. The Maplecrest building has since been demolished and its acreage sold off. The Maplewood building on South Diamond Street still stands, it’s outward appearance reminiscent of its original purpose, and is now an apartment building.

Illinois,Morgan County Tuberculosis Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oak_Lawn_Retreat,1871,,1917 (as a sanatorium),Demolished,Single Building,,Oak Lawn Retreat | McFarland’s Insane Retreat | Oaklawn,"Among those leading the local fight against TB in the early 1900s was Dr. T.O. Hardesty, who helped organize the Morgan County Anti-Tuberculosis Society in 1905, the second such group in Illinois. A few years later, Hardesty established a clinic and began treating patients with TB, which can cause a fever, emaciation, loss of strength, coughing, breathing difficulties and the spitting up of blood.
The state of Illinois joined the TB battle soon thereafter when the legislature passed a bill authorizing county governments to levy a tax for the purpose of establishing and maintaining TB sanatoriums, according to records of the Morgan County Anti-Tuberculosis Society. The tax dollars helped the local TB organization buy Oaklawn Retreat, a private psychiatric hospital on east side of Jacksonville, in 1917.
Oaklawn Retreat, also known at one time as McFarland’s Insane Retreat, was established by Dr. Andrew McFarland in a hilltop grove of oak trees in 1872. The main building, which was said to have been modeled after a Scottish abbey, housed mentally-ill patients from as far away as Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming. The TB association remodeled the building and renamed it Oaklawn, the Morgan County TB Sanatorium.
Few drugs were used in the early years of the sanatorium. In fact, of 78 patients treated one year, only $476.58 was spent for medication. Sick would have their beds wheeled onto a porch on the south side of Oaklawn, where they would be exposed, even in cold weather, to fresh air and sunlight, which were thought to improve the patients’ health. Patients’ average stay at Oaklawn was from 18 months to two years, according to sanatorium records
Antibiotics developed after World War II joined the fight against TB and greatly reduced the incidence of the disease. By the 1960s, the Oaklawn staff was turning more to prevention and early diagnosis as fewer patients were hospitalized at Oaklawn each year. The Oaklawn TB Clinic moved to the Medical Center on West Walnut Street in 1969, and the old sanatorium building was razed in 1981.",1969,"Jacksonville, IL",,

Illinois,Willow Bark Institute,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Willow_Bark_Institute,,,1895,Demolished,Single Building,,,"In the early 1890s, Danvers physician Fred J. Parkhurst opened the Willow Bark Institute, staking his personal and professional reputation on a peculiar method to cure drunkenness. Parkhurst's treatment consisted of having patients ingest a bitter liquid before they downed a shot of whiskey. The main ingredient in the cure was salicin, a chemical found in the bark of the willow tree that's similar to aspirin. Obviously, Parkhurst hoped that after the typical three-week treatment his patients would associate their reflexive nausea with demon whiskey. There were similar treatment programs, the most famous being the Keeley Cure. Based in Dwight, Dr. Leslie E. Keeley's gold chloride treatment was well known throughout the nation.
In May 1903, Parkhurst opened the Concord Hotel in Danvers to serve as a boarding house for his patients. The Concord featured more than 40 rooms, public and private dinning areas and a well-appointed lobby that opened onto a spacious porch running alongside two sides of the hotel. Parkhurst passed away in 1915, though his institute remained open for several more years. In 1935, Ernest W. Mammen, a longtime Bloomington surgeon, resurrected the Willow Bark name and reopened the clinic at the old Parkhurst home in Danvers. Dr. Mammen closed this second incarnation of the institute in 1950.",1950,"Danvers, IL",,

The Danville Branch is important both for what it illustrates about the evolution of medical facilities for veterans in the United States and for the architectural significance of the buildings at the facility.  The hospital, chapels, library, specialized clinics, residential buildings, and other amenities together convey a comprehensive approach to health care for veterans.  From the beginning, the branch offered shelter, education, training, employment, and recreation in a planned community which was a showplace with beautiful gardens and recreational facilities open to the public. The historic district also includes a National Cemetery with the graves of thousands of veterans. The restful campus is set in a tree strewn landscape with low scale buildings and curving roadways that wind past the golf course, pond, quarters, hospital ward buildings, Greenhouse Clinic, and agricultural fields that once provided work and therapy for patients.  The National Council of State Garden Clubs placed a plaque on the curving entrance road designating it a Blue Star Memorial Highway as a “A tribute to the Armed Forces that have defended the United States of America.”
Joseph Cannon, a congressman from the Danville area, used political influence to get the branch located in Danville, because he knew the facility would bring Federal money and jobs to the area.  He also thought the branch would increase the number of Republican voters in the area, thus gaining him more supporters.  His influential role in establishing a National Home branch in Danville earned him the title “Father of the Home.”  By 1910, 4,257 veterans were at the branch.  The Danville Branch became a neuropsychiatric hospital in 1935, after the National Home branch became a part of the Veterans Administration, and today provides a variety of services to veterans.
Two circular areas are focal points of the branch that is now divided between the VA medical center and the Danville Area Community College.  The perimeter of the northern circle had 15 Continued Treatment Wards where veterans slept.  Ten of these handsome, brick Georgian style buildings remain (Buildings 5-14).  In the center of the circle, the Georgian Revival General Mess Hall (Building 17) provided veterans with services including the dining hall.  The Danville Area Community College bought most of the buildings in this circle in the mid-1960s.  The Continued Treatment Wards are currently used for classrooms and other activities related to the community college.  The VA still owns four Wards and uses them as resource and administration buildings.  The staff quarters are scattered about to the south and west of the circle.
The National Cemetery dates from 1898 when the Danville Branch opened. The cemetery was originally a small plot to the east of the two circles on campus.  In 1901, a new cemetery was laid out in concentric circles on 30 acres to the southeast of the original cemetery.  Ninety-nine graves from the first cemetery were moved and reinterred in the new cemetery.  The cemetery now contains thousands of veterans' graves.  A Civil War Soldiers Monument, designed by sculptor Clark Nobel, was dedicated at the cemetery on Memorial Day in 1917.  Clark Nobel sculpted the bronze life-sized figure of a Civil War soldier holding a musket.",,"Danville, IL",,

The school was temporarily located in Jacksonville and after a five-year trial period the General Assembly incorporated it as the Illinois Institution for the Education of Feeble-Minded Children.
As one of the state's permanent charitable institutions, it was to provide care, support, training, and education for mentally deficient children. A three-member board of trustees, appointed by the Governor, exercised general supervision and selected a superintendent to operate the institution. They also were subject to the investigative authority of the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities. Appropriations for the acquisition of land and the construction of buildings were made in 1875 but the institution's permanent quarters in Lincoln were not occupied until 1878. In 1877 the institution's name became the Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children.
The institution had its own hospital and shops in which inmates manufactured brushes, mattresses, and shoes. Inmates also worked on a nearby farm owned and operated by the institution.
In 1909 the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities and the boards of trustees of all state charitable institutions were abolished and executive and administrative control was transferred to the newly created Board of Administration. Under the new board the institution became Lincoln State School and Colony.
To sustain the school, in 1929 the Illinois Department of Public Welfare built a residential farm colony for men about two miles away from the main campus. The state purchased 725 acres of land, and there it built ten ward buildings, a kitchen,a dining room, and a powerhouse. The new colony provided housing for 620 men without severe disabilities who then worked the farmland along with supervisor employees.
With the passage of the Civil Administrative Code in 1917 the Department of Public Welfare assumed all responsibility for the school and retained control until the creation of the Department of Mental Health in 1961. The school's name which had been shortened to Lincoln State School in 1953 was again altered to Lincoln Developmental Center in 1975.
In the 1970s activists advocated for the closure of large institutions, arguing that people with mental retardation should be cared for in the community. Spurred on by this movement—and by lawsuits, rising costs, and changing notions of the rights of people with mental retardation—many states sought alternatives to state schools in the 1970s. In Illinois, state schools came to the forefront of public attention with the appearance of a shocking series of articles about the living conditions at the Lincoln and Dixon state schools. After years of investigations into neglect and abuse of patients, the facility closed on August 31, 2002. The farm annex has been converted into a prison. Construction on a new Illinois Youth Center began in March 2023. Funding from the Rebuild Illinois Capital program will provide renovations of two 4,300 square foot cottages for housing, with additional cottages for programming and administrative use. A new 27,000 square foot multipurpose building will include educational, recreational, and dietary services.

Illinois,Illinois State Training School for Boys at St. Charles,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Illinois_State_Training_School_for_Boys_at_St._Charles,1901,1903,1904,Active,Cottage Plan,,Illinois State Training School for Boys  | Illinois Youth Center,"In the early 1900s, with concern for the juvenile delinquent slowly growing, new institutions opened in order to combat and overcome the problem. With the cooperation of both Governor Richard Yates and a philanthropic educator, Nelson McClain, construction began on the Illinois State Home for Delinquent Boys. Here officials planned not only to care for delinquents but also neglected or orphaned boys. Delinquents were considered anyone under the age of sixteen who broke the law and could receive care at a suitable institution.
Once finished, the institution sat on 900 acres of farm land west of St. Charles. The purpose of the school was to provide the young boys with a good education in both intellectual and vocational studies so that once released they could make a respectable living. Not only did the institution offer education to the boys, it also offered religious guidance and military training.
Like many reformatory institutions, the school's layout was based on the cottage system. This system of housing worked around a group of cottages which housed approximately 50 boys. Each cottage had a house mother and father who served as guardians. The cottages created a home-like environment for the boys. Living rooms and kitchens were found in each cottage, making their stay at the institution more comfortable.
Since its establishment in 1904, the Youth Center has gone through many changes. In 1970, officials phased out farm operation in order to place a greater emphasis on the academic, vocational, and counseling programs. By 1989, the institution had also added programs that dealt with behavior problem intervention and added a new medical and confinement wing.
In the early 2000’s the issue of operating costs became a threat to the Illinois Youth Center.  In 2004, Governor Rod Blagojevich proposed closing the Illinois Youth Center-St. Charles and sending the inmates to other correctional facilities in order to save Illinois taxpayers what he said would be nearly $12 million.  At the time, the St. Charles Illinois Youth Center was the 8th largest employer in St. Charles with 327 employees.  The closing was never carried out.
With an investigation prompted by a suicide at the facility, more problems at the St. Charles Illinois Youth Center were exposed in a 2009 report by the John Howard Association of Illinois. The organization found “appalling” conditions at the Center. Buildings magnificent in the past, such as the chapel, were closed due to high mold and mildew levels.  Other structures had failing plumbing which posed sanitation threats.  Furniture and fixtures in the sleeping areas were seen as outdated and safety risks to inmates.  Governor Pat Quinn, in late 2009, responded to the reports by appropriating $71,000 for the IYC, which continued to operate the St. Charles facility.
Several inmates of the Illinois Boy’s School/Illinois Youth Center gained notoriety for crimes committed after they left the institution. Bank robber and murderer “Baby Face” Nelson (Lester Gillis) was housed at the Illinois Youth Center for Boys several times between 1922 and 1925, once for stealing a car in Cook County at the age of 13. Jose Padilla, charged in 2002 with planning to detonate a “dirty bomb” in the U.S., and convicted in 2007 on terrorism charges, was incarcerated at the Illinois Youth Center-St. Charles from 1985-1988 on armed robbery charges. Jeff Fort, the former gang leader, now serving time for murder and federal domestic terrorism charges was once incarcerated at the facility.
Today, the Illinois Youth Center-St. Charles functions as a Level 2 medium-security facility for male youth and has a capacity of 318 inmates.

T. Ellis in Honey Creek Township for a poor farm. By May 1855 a larger farm was purchased in Gilmer Township. County records were mandated in 1874 to show admission, discharge, place of birth, cause of the dependence and other vital data. A report from county poorhouse records to the General Assembly of Illinois in 1881 indicated there were 101 inmates of whom 36 were considered insane paupers. The report stated that a female patient who ""occupies a large wooden box filled with straw will not wear clothing, is covered with a canvass cloth, is in constant motion, has bruised herself from head to foot, and put out her own eyes.""
A new Adams County almshouse was built southwest of Coatsburg in Gilmer Township in 1875, and another building for insane patients was added in 1895.The Adams County Poor Farm was not equipped to care for the mentally ill. Reports of poor conditions surfaced in the newspapers from time to time. A Quincy Daily Journal story on Feb. 12, 1892, pointed to abuses including underfed and neglected inmates.

Illinois,Carroll County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Carroll_County_Farm,1851,,1852,,,,,"From the ""Thomson Review"" 09 February 1933
Carroll County Residents who have never called on their employee W. H. Christian, Superintendent of the Carroll County Home for the past 17 years should plan to do so one of these days. They will find Mr. Christian and his good wife ready and eager to show them through the building and explain just what goes on each day of the year. The Review Reporter dropped in and was told a great many facts which should prove of interest to readers.
The present site was purchased in June 1864, when the board of supervisors consisting of George G. Groves, Orlando S. Beardsley, Seymour Downs, Fisher Allenson, John Heileman, Hugh Gillespie, Andrew Dodds, M.D. Lewis, William S. Ashton, Rufus M. Cook, and Andrew Hamilton bought the land from Jacob P. Emmert. At that time there were less than 10 inmates while at present there are 38. The farm covers 156 acres and contains well kept modern buildings. Mr. and Mrs. Christian, with the help of the inmates do most of the work, though at certain times the superintendent has to hire one man and two women to assist with the work.
The cyclone of 1898 wrecked all of the buildings on the farm and the main building now in use was built in 98 after the storm. The annex was erected in 1915. The buildings are all modern with steam heat, electric lights, modern plumbing and 70 feet of fire hose on each floor. There are three baths in the mens part and two in the ladies part.
In 1916 when Mr. and Mrs. Christian took charge of the farm there were 19 people living there. Forty-Eight deaths have occurred in the past 17 years. 280 people between the ages of 40 and 92 have been taken into the home and 197 have been discharged. The duties of the Christian is varied and takes all of their time. There are three invalids at the home right now but none are sick and Mr. Christian is proud to state that there has been no sickness thus far this winter. Mrs. Christian looks after the beds, scrubbing and cleaning and is assisted by one maid. The two women do all the cooking
Monday is always wash day and in the past 14 years only 8 Mondays have been missed. Tuesday is ironing day and on Wednesday all necessary repair work is done. All the articles are initialed. The inmates look after the stock and do the necessary outdoor work. It has been 2 years since a state inspector has visited but at the time he gave the place a high rating. Each inmate has their own room, lots of sunshine, good venilating system and the men and women eat in their own dining rooms.
Dr. Rice has been the physician since 1916 and he gives everyone wonderful medical care. If an inmate is seriously ill a nurse is called and employed as long as needed. Both the superintendent and the physician are appointed by the board of supervisors and work under the direction of the committee appointed in April.
Mr. and Mrs. Christian are both very economical and have managed to cut down the cost for each person, in keeping with the times. At the present with all expenses figured in it cost but .62 cents per day for each person in the house. Mr. and Mrs. Christian are both very efficient, are pleasing to the patients and are most satisfactory to the tax payers in the county.",,"Mount Carroll, IL",,

Illinois,Champaign County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Champaign_County_Poor_Farm,,,1857,,Single Building,,Champaign County Nursing Home,"Land for the first Champaign County Poor Farm was first purchased in 1857 in the township of St. Joseph. The original poorhouse in Champaign County was 116 acres. Initially, men were awarded contracts for the “keeping of the paupers of the County and the renting of the County Farm”. Whoever won the contract to provide for the ‘paupers’, would then have the right to put the ‘paupers’ to work on the land. In 1863, it was decided that each township within Champaign County would care for its poor instead of operating at a county level and the county poor farm was temporarily dissolved for two years.
In 1865, officials reverted to the county system and a new tract of land consisting of 42 acres a mile east of the Champaign County Courthouse was purchased for a county farm. By 1866, a house had been built at a cost of just over $7500. A report from 1884 describes repairs and improvements which have been made at the Champaign County Poor Farm and notes that, “the number of inmates present was thirty-nine…of whom nine were insane, one an idiot, one blind and three were children under sixteen years of age.”  The quarters for the insane are, “much improved since the last visit, much tidier and the odor not so offensive.” The system of management shifted in 1887 from contract base to elected official. A superintendent was elected to manage the poor farm and house. The living quarters for the non-insane separated the men from the women. Men and women had separate dining rooms, sitting rooms and sleeping quarters. For the sake of economy, a boiler system was used to cook the food, consisting primarily of steamed vegetables. Acreage was added to the complex over the years to expand the farm portion. The grounds of the Champaign County Poor Farm included: a large house, a cell house for the insane, shelters for livestock and fields for crops. Inhabitants of the poor farm were expected to work. Ideally, the poor farm would be self-sustaining through the crops and livestock; however, the inhabitants of the Champaign County Poor Farm consisted almost entirely of the elderly, the disabled and the chronically ill who were physically incapable of work, hence their residence at the poor farm. This proved to be a fundamental flaw of the poor farm system. The Champaign County Poor Farm transitioned to the Champaign County Nursing Home in the 1930s.
Burials were made between the late 1800's to middle 1900's, but soon after the graves were ""lost"". In 1970 during some construction, the graves were ""re-discovered"", and moved about 50 feed east, were a memorial service dedicating the new resting place took place August 10, 1970. There is an estimate of around 100 graves in the original cemetery.",,"Urbana, IL",,

Illinois,Cook County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cook_County_Infirmary,1869,,1910 (Current Location),Active,Pavilion Plan,Holabird & Roche,Cook County Poorhouse | Cook County Poor Farm | Oak Forest Infirmary | Oak Forest Tuberculosis Hospital | Oak Forest Hospital | Oak Forest Health Center,"Under state law each county has had responsibility for providing a variety of social services to its most destitute residents, and in the nineteenth century each county in the Chicago region established its own almshouse. The Cook County Almshouse was the only public institution at any jurisdictional level specifically established to provide long-term refuge for the most extremely destitute people in the Chicago area. These were people with chronic physical illnesses or disabilities, mental illness or retardation, elderly people, or single mothers unable to work for a living even during periods when jobs were plentiful. Infamous for its corruption, mismanagement, deplorable living conditions, and maltreatment of inmates, the almshouse was regarded as a refuge of last resort. The number of residents ranged from 75 in 1854 to a peak of about 4,300 in January 1932, but usually the population, of whom approximately 10 percent were children, hovered around 1,000. The insane asylum department housed an additional 500–1,000 persons.
The Cook County commissioners allocated all almshouse funds and appointed the county agent, who not only determined admission to the almshouse but also distributed any county “outdoor” relief to “deserving” paupers. The commissioners also selected the staffs of the almshouse and the insane asylum. This situation erupted in major scandal nearly once every decade. In 1869, in an effort to make all public and private charitable institutions in Illinois more accountable, the legislature established a State Board of Public Charities. Its five members, private volunteers, were charged with visiting every institution in all 102 counties at least annually. Although they produced valuable biennial written reports and recommendations, they had no authority over the administration of the institutions.
Until the 1940s, almshouse personnel were largely untrained political appointees, but efforts were occasionally made to provide limited differential care. For example, because of concerns that the almshouse was an unfit environment for children, a schoolhouse and teacher were provided on the grounds. Separate cottages were allocated to lying-in patients and individuals with consumption or tuberculosis. More to prevent pandemonium than to provide special medical care, the county began maintaining an insane asylum in conjunction with the almshouse in 1870. When the almshouse moved from Dunning to Oak Forest, the insane asylum stayed behind to be turned over to state management. The Chicago State Hospital at Dunning, established in 1912, still exists.
Although the county almshouse was originally located, from 1835 to 1841, in the center of Chicago on the town square (at Clark and Randolph), all subsequent locations were rural, chosen with the persistent if impractical idea that residents work the land to pay their way. These farms included 160 acres in Lake Township, 1841–1854; 160 acres five miles from the North Branch of the Chicago River, 1854–1883, expanded to 240 acres with new buildings and a county-constructed railroad station called Dunning, 1883–1910; and, finally, 360 acres in Bremen Township, the Oak Forest Infirmary designed by Holabird & Roche, 1911–1956. The farm ceased operation in 1956 when the institution became licensed as a hospital, but Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County remained on the site and continues to serve the chronically ill as part of the Cook County Health Care System.

Illinois,Coles County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Coles_County_Almshouse,,,1870,Preserved,,,Ashmore Estates,"From 1857 until 1869, the Coles County Poor Farm was located in Charleston Township near the small town of Loxa. In 1870, the county purchased 260 acres from A. N. Graham in Section 35 of Ashmore Township for a new farm, which sat astride the Indianapolis & St. Louis Railroad. This small timber and brick building, constructed by H. B. Truman, was the first to sit on that property. It was 38x58 feet and two stories tall, with an attached kitchen. The initial superintendent or “Overseer of the Poor” of the county farm was Oliver D. Hawkins, who immigrated to Coles County from Kentucky in 1841.
Many of these residents, or “inmates” as they were called, died at the farm, and the county maintained a small cemetery somewhere north of the grounds. In 1879, Joshua Ricketts, superintendent of the county farm at the time, had recorded 32 deaths out of the roughly 250 inmates who had stayed at the farm between 1870 and 1879. Another pauper cemetery, established a few years later, still exists south of Route 16 and now contains the graves of between sixty to one hundred persons.
The Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities visited the poor farm in 1902. “The heating is by stove and is sufficient,” they reported. “There is no regular system of ventilation, but plenty of fresh air is easily obtained. There is no plumbing… There is no fire protection.” As for the condition of the mentally ill at the farm, they wrote, “There is no special provision for the insane… None are locked up or in restraint.” By 1911, however, the Auxiliary Committee of the State Board of Charities condemned the almshouse for its “vermin infected walls,” “rough floors,” “small windows,” and improper ventilation. It was reported that “flies swarmed everywhere” and “were especially noticeable on the poor food prepared for dinner.” In January 1915, the Almshouse Committee, headed up by John Goodyear, Ivory W. Merritt, Jr., E.N. Carter, W.R. Zimmerman, and William Knollenberg, received bids for the construction of a new “fireproof” building at the location.
The newer buildings operated for over 40 years, until in 1959, the county sold the facility to Ashmore Estates Inc. They operated the facility as a private mental hospital until 1964 when it closed to financial issues. The following year it reopened, with a change, that it now accepted patients from state-run psychiatric hospitals. In 1976 Paul Swinford purchased the building and reworked it to be used as a ICFDD (Intermediate Care Facility for the Developmentally Disabled).  The building remained in use until 1987 when it was closed due to lack of funding. Three years later, in 1990, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) had attempted to turn Ashmore Estates into a mental facility for teenage boys. Due to fire safety and code laws then, The Ashmore Village Board rejected their request. The property has changed hands several times since then and is still privately owned but only functions as a haunted house for part of the year.",1986,"Loxa, IL",,

By January 1957, there was a waiting list and budget problems: The state only released $10,000 of the $54,000 promised. It was the beginning of a theme that continues today. But money pitfalls have also never stopped the clinic from pushing for more services. A year after reporting budget deficits in 1965, the clinic expanded service to patients in surrounding counties thanks to a tax referendum passed in 1966. After mostly just outpatient services up until then, by 1970, the clinic served more than 1,500 clients and provided additional services like day care, emergency services, consultation, substance abuse treatment, a halfway house for alcoholics, after care for those leaving state mental hospitals, and an outreach worker for the poor.
The next 20-plus years were probably the smoothest in the center’s history. By 1980, under the direction of Anne Menz, a crisis hotline was added and there were more than 2,000 clients. In 1982, the center began establishing apartments for clients who previously had been in mental hospitals. While the center continued to sustain financially with the establishment of Medicaid as a pay source for many low-income people with mental health problems, outside forces caused the biggest upheaval in the center’s history. It began in 1995 with the closing of the Adolf Meyer Mental Health Center, which caused an influx of patients to the Decatur Mental Health Center. Right when the center had adjusted to that, in 1996 DMH decided to tear down the old City Public Hospital building, where the center had been located for 40 years.
The Decatur Mental Health Center was forced to relocate to the old Meyer Mental Health Center building, where the Decatur Correctional Center is now located on East Mound. It was there for about a year but was moved out when the women’s prison came in to being. The center was forced to move to the old Decatur Herald building at 357 N. Main St. while it renovated the former Quigle’s building downtown. On Jan. 5, 1998, it was announced the Decatur Mental Health Center would move into the former Quigles building, 151 N. Main St., and change its name to Heritage Behavioral Health Center. At the 50-year mark, in 2006, Heritage served more than 7,000 clients and had a staff of 210.",,"Decatur, IL",,

Illinois,DuPage County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=DuPage_County_Infirmary,,,1888,Demolished,Single Building,,DuPage County Almshouse | DuPage County Convalescent Home,"originally built in 1888 as the County Alms House, or poor farm, for the indigent.  It was known as the ""county farm"" which eventually led to the naming of the road the facility resides on today.  The residents were initially known as inmates and farmed the 217-acre parcel which included a heard of dairy cattle.  The farm produced most of the food necessary to feed the residents.  In return for the work of the residents, they were provided shelter and board.
While some residents of the farm maintained the facility as a permanent retirement home, a majority of residents were transient and regularly traveled to and from alms houses/farms in other counties.  It wasn’t until the 1930’s that the DuPage Care Center began operating as a nursing facility.  At that time, the facility was taking in individuals that required health care as a result of tuberculosis.  The name of the facility was changed to the DuPage County Convalescent Home in 1942.

The next location in the second half of the 19th century was in what was then a rural location at Peachtree and Piedmont roads. After that area started to develop into a residential district, the government of Fulton County purchased 1,000 acres even farther from downtown for two new almshouses to be built in 1911; the main building was for white residents, and another building nearby was for African-Americans. This occurred during the era of Jim Crow segregation when separate public facilities were commonplace in the South. The former almshouse for African Americans is now on a different parcel, owned by a different entity, and outside the boundary for this nomination. (It is currently used by the Chastain Arts Center.) In addition to using it as an almshouse, the county once housed black female prisoners in the rear section of the caretaker's house at the black almshouse. Some of these African-American women worked in the kitchen and did other domestic chores, such as cooking, cleaning, and caretaking, at the almshouse for white residents. These prisoners functioned as the staff for the white almshouse, under the
direction of the superintendent and nurses.
After 1932, the property also was known as Haven Home. Ms. Jessie Clark Boynton became superintendent in 1932 and remained in this position until the end of the almshouse era in 1963. She was instrumental in supervising female prisoners who lived in a wing at the almshouse for African Americans and did domestic work at the almshouse for Whites; she helped them find jobs upon their release. Ms. Boynton also instituted recreational programs for elderly residents.
The days of the building as an almshouse ended in 1963; the remaining residents were moved elsewhere. The property served as an annex for a local elementary school for a time. It was leased from the county in 1969 and became a private school, the Galloway School, founded by Elliot Galloway. Few alterations were needed to convert the almshouse to a school; some interior walls were removed to convert bedrooms to classrooms; the original windows remain. Dropped ceilings and new lighting fixtures have been added to the school as well as new electrical wiring. Some dormers have been added on the courtyard-facing side of the attic of the west wing to create more classrooms.",1963,"Atlanta, GA",Neoclassical Revival,

Illinois,Greene County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Greene_County_Poor_House,,,1842/1870/1939,Demolished,Single Building,,Greene County Almshouse,"Greene County established its first almshouse, or poorhouse, about 10 miles west of the location of the final almshouse and the current Almshouse Cemetery and Memorial Park. Land was purchased just east of what was then Springfield’s eastern city limits, near Pickwick Avenue. There, a “substantial brick building” was erected and used as an almshouse in 1873. By 1890 the city had grown to include the location of the almshouse, and the property had increased in value. Also, the increasing number of residents had rendered the old building too small for their accommodation. The decision was made to build a new almshouse on property west of town on Division Street.
The News and Leader newspaper published a story in 1937 with photos that exposed the terrible conditions at the almshouse. The report refers to the almshouse as a “tumble-down, overcrowded, filthy firetrap which serves Greene County as an almshouse — where 135 men and women daily risk their lives by merely living.…” It also says Works Progress Administration (WPA) officials had approved plans to build a new almshouse the next year. The new building was completed in 1939.
This location would be used as an almshouse until 1978. When a resident died at this almshouse, he or she were sometimes buried in an unmarked grave in a pasture just north of the almshouse.",1978,"Carrollton, IL",Italianate,

It was for the sum of $10 for medicine and attendance to one ""Joseph Brown, pauper."" Unfortunately with the development of any community comes poverty, and the tax payers are always forced to make provision for those whom the chances of life leave destitute. Grundy County has not been exempt, and its people have nobly risen to the occasion, and now have one of the best equipped poor farms in the State. The first farm of 160 acres was in Norman Township. The county paid $2,400 for it but found it was too large and portions of it were sold to outsiders.
On October 27, 1879, eighty acres of land was bought for $45 per acre, in Wauponsee Township to build a new poor farm. An old brick building standing upon the property was torn down and a large frame building was built. This was used for about twenty years, and when it was decided to build new quarters, it was partially wrecked, and the rubbish was sold to a party who removed it.

Illinois,Hamilton County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hamilton_County_Almshouse,,,,Preserved,,,,"""The almshouse in this county consists of two log buildings, one of which is occupied by the keeper, the other by the paupers. The pauper house contains two rooms, joined by a porch; and one of the rooms is divided through the centre by a partition. The keeper is paid two dollars a week for each pauper cared for, and furnishes everything, including medicine and medical attendance. There were only five inmates on the day of visitation, of whom two were idiotic. [Source: ""Reports to the General Assembly of Illinois"", Vol 1, 1871]
The Hamilton county almshouse is located two and a half miles northeast of McLeansboro. The farm contains 160 acres of land of inferior quality, of which 10 acres is in orchard and garden and 70 acres cultivated. The building is frame, old and battered, without underpinning, with window panes missing, locks and latches, and in some instances doors, broken off for years. The facilities for separating the sexes are nominal. But one stove is used in this entire building. This is placed in the sitting room, also used as a dining room, used by all the inmates.
The one insane inmate is filthy beyond all description and should be removed. He and his room are as clean as it is possible to keep either, where the conveniences for caring for this class of patients are almost wholly wanting. The bedding of the more cleanly inmates is in good condition. There are numerous evidences that vermin at one time abounded, though the present management think they have them under control. A three-year-old girl who is here with her mother should be sent to the Asylum for the Feeble Minded. No religious services are ever held, or reading matter supplied. The food is cooked by the management, and served by the inmates.
For $55.00 per year and the income of the farm the superintendent agrees to furnish food, clothing, furniture and care of the inmates. One naturally speculates on what the conditions would have been had the lowest bid of $40.00 per year per capita been accepted.

Illinois,Henry County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Henry_County_Infirmary,1853,,,Active,,,Hillcrest Home,"Henry County located its Poor Farm north of Cambridge, the county seat, on Illinois Route 82. Today that county owned facility is known as Hillcrest Home. In the mid 1800’s the Henry County Board created the Poor House. It served as a home for the poor and the homeless. It often served as a home for those who had no where else to turn. Many of the residents were newly arrived immigrants from European countries. Many were ill, injured or crippled. Some stayed for a short time; others stayed for years. Babies were born there. It took on the aspects of a small village.
In 1871 the need for additional space resulted in the construction of a new building at a cost of $50,000. It was said to be the best building in the State of Illinois. Approximately 320 acres of farm grounds was purchased. While it was a farm, the able residents were responsible for raising the crops, caring for the livestock and raising garden produce. The rooms were described as light and airy. On the grounds there was a large infirmary as well as a kitchen, bakery, fruit room, milk room, cold storage place and laundry. Separate private dining quarters were provided for the men and for the women.
The personnel who operated the Poor House and Poor Farm were hired by a Committee appointed by the County Board. While compiling the Index, the volunteers found two January 19, 1907 advertisements in one of the ledger books. The two legal notices were printed in the Henry County Chronicle. The first ad sought a proposal from “a warden and wife to take charge of the Poor House and the inmates and the Poor Farm of Henry County.” Note that the ad indicates there were two separate entities to be attended by the warden and the matron. The second ad was for a physician for the “Inmates of the Poor House at Henry County.” In both instances the proposals were to be submitted to the County Clerk by the end of January with a one year contract starting on March 1st.
At this time each township helped with the cost of room and board for the people from their township. It was often stated that the Henry County Infirmary provided some of the older Henry County residents with a “home away from home.” With the purchase of the 320 acres and the establishment of the Poor Farm, two employees were hired to help farm the land which consisted of 75 acres of corn, 50 acres of oats and balance in hay or pasture. The farm housed 25 cows, 30 head of young stock, 300 laying hens and 6 horses. Some of the farm work was done with a tractor. Two cooks and two cook helpers served meals to the residents at 7 a.m., noon, and 5:30 p.m. The people who lived at the Poor House and Poor Farm helped with the chores as well as growing the food and vegetables for their use.
On Sunday, July 28, 1912 at 4 p.m., the Infirmary accidentally burned to the ground. The fire originated as a result of an attempt to smoke out chimney swallows that were nesting in a ventilator. The fire in the duct spread quickly to the tinder dry attic. Concerned citizens of Henry County arrived by horse and buggy to view the damage, but only the brick shell remained. Fifty-eight residents were living in the Infirmary at the time. Some were taken to the Geneseo Hospital. Others were temporarily sent to neighboring counties. And, some slept on cots in the machine shed.
A decision was made to construct a new building. On September 24, 1912 plans began for a new “fire proof” structure at a cost of $110,000. The home was divided into three sections, much like the former home, to house the men on one side and the women on the other. The middle section was for the dining and recreation common space. A spacious lawn was place in the front of the building with trees, shrubs and flowers. There were long rows of peonies, irises and roses along the flower-bordered walks.
With the advent of the welfare program in 1949, fewer residents of Henry County needed admission to the Alms House. Henry County took the initiative to become the first county in Illinois to convert its Infirmary/Poor Farm into a convalescent home. At that time the name was changed from the Henry County Infirmary to the Henry County Convalescent Center. All 120 rooms were redecorated. The hospital and the hospital quarters were completely redone. The individuals living at the Center were referred to as “patients.” They were paying customers. As to the farming operations, in 1957 Henry County decided to quit operating the farm itself and began leasing out the land. The Center continued to be under the supervision of a Committee of County Board supervisors.
As evidenced by Superintendent Wilson’s response the institution has been known under a number of names. In 1970 Henry County Convalescent Home was renamed Hillcrest Home. A skilled care addition was added to the home in 1976. It included a physical therapy room, an activity area, a beauty shop, and an employee classroom. It continues to be owned and operated by the people of Henry County. Day to day operations is coordinated by a licensed nursing home administrator. The Health and Human Services Committee, which is comprised of four Henry County Board members, meets monthly to discuss and review the activities at Hillcrest. Their findings are reported to the Henry County Board each month.
There is a small cemetery on the property. Between 1899 & 1937 it was used to bury those that either had no family or funds to be buried elsewhere.

Illinois,Jersey County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jersey_County_Farm,,,1845 (Original building),Preserved,Single Building,,,"In a special Jersey County Commissioners meeting on Oct. 13, 1845, the commission voted to purchase 166 acres in the county for the sum of $900 to establish a poor farm. By December of that year, it was up and running. The county, through the years, found that larger or more suitable facilities were needed, and thus the county would acquire different properties throughout the 1800s. Around 1868-69, 160 acres were purchased in English Township upon which was erected a large brick house, along with all the necessary outbuildings required for a farm. Even an orchard was planted in front of the house.
This building, which served as the third poorhouse, burned in 1887. Another one was built on the same property, which, in Aug. 1921, also burned. The fifth and final poorhouse was constructed not long after, and continued to serve its purpose until 1956, when it closed and was sold to Les Boner, thus turning the farm over into private hands. As the twentieth century wore on, the demographics of poorhouses, also known as county farms, were beginning to shift as society itself experienced major changes. Primarily elderly persons were housed in them. Now, societal advancements have made these county farms for the poor, elderly and mentally disabled obsolete, as newer, and even more humane facilities came to take their place.",1956,"Jerseyville, IL",,

Illinois,Kane County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kane_County_Poor_Farm,1852,,1853,Demolished,Single Building,,Kane County Alms House | Kane County Farm and Home,"The farm was established in 1852 as refuge for the indigent, senior citizens and mentally ill. The name was changed by Superintendent Frank Averill (tenure 1914 - 1935) to Kane County Farm, in order to restore a sense of dignity to the residents. It should also be noted that the facility also served as a hospital, since the hospitals in the area were either for fee, not nearby, or non-existent. In the early 20th century, circa 1912, laws were changed regarding treatment and housing of the mentally ill. The ""insane"" at the farm were removed primarily to the Elgin State Hospital (est. 1872). No further mental patients were taken in at the Farm.
It was a fully functioning, and extremely large, residential facility, with a large crop and dairy farm. The Farm closed in 1971 & the structures were razed.
Residents who died there were often buried in the on-site cemetery. The cemetery is located on what is now the grounds of the Kane County Sheriff's Dept. and former county jail. Graves in the northern two-thirds of the cemetery were thought to have been dug in the early 1850s until the late 1920s. They were never marked. In the southern third, 167 small concrete cylindrical markers were installed for burials from 1931 to the last one, but many were lost or obscured.",1971,"Geneva, IL",,
Illinois,Kankakee County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kankakee_County_Almshouse,,,1856/1893,Demolished,Single Building,,Kankakee County Poor Farm,"The first Kankakee County Poor Farm was located about 1-mile northeast of what is now the Village of Bonfield. It was purchased by the county in 1856 from George Smith for $1,600. In 1958, some 102 years later, the County Poor Farm (then located in Kankakee at Entrance Avenue north of Mertens Street) finally closed its doors. 
In May 1890, the Kankakee County Board of Supervisors faced a crisis: the existing county poor farm was running out of room. The board was notified the Eastern Illinois Hospital for the Insane (later Kankakee State Hospital) would soon be discharging three “incurable patients” to be cared for by the county. (At that time, each county served by the state hospital was assigned a quota for patients. When that quota was exceeded, patients would be released to the county.) The Kankakee Gazette reported “The county must provide for these and others to follow as best it can outside of the county house until the new house is ready for use.”
At its meeting on June 20, 1890, the County Board approved buying the property, and 20 acres of land adjoining it to the west, to bring the total size of the farm to 42 acres. The additional acreage cost $2,500. Also approved was a contract with architect C.D. Henry Sr., of Bonfield, to prepare plans for a three-story stone building to be erected on the new Kankakee County Poor Farm grounds. A sum of $13,000 was set aside to pay for construction of the new building (when that building was completed in 1893, the final cost came to $17,000).
In May 1894, a reporter for the Kankakee Times made an unannounced visit to the poor farm and wrote a lengthy article on his impressions. In the new building, he noted, “we could not help observing how clean everything looked, especially the floors and stairs.” He had a far different impression of “the old building, which has been standing a number of years doing duty as a poor house. The old building has long outlived its age of usefulness and should be torn down.”
Describing the farm’s inmates, he observed three men who were “seated on a settee in a corridor. A more inanimate trio of human beings it would be hard to find. Apathetic describes them exactly.” Another group “was seated around a red-hot stove during our visit and seemed from their melancholy attitudes to be meditating over the past.” The Kankakee County Poor Farm shut down in 1958. The reason for closing the facility was described by County Board Chairman George R. Luehrs: “Old age pensions and other retirement funds have virtually eliminated the need for a county farm.”",1958,"Bonfield, IL",,

Illinois,Knox County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Knox_County_Almshouse,1856,,1866,Demolished,Single Building,W. W. Boyington,Knox County Poor Farm,"In 1856 Cephas Arms, John S. Winter and Rufus S. Miles served on a committee of the County Board of Supervisors (now named the County Board). The men stated that conditions at the poor farm were inadequate. The building wasn’t large enough for the number of residents. One patient, Crazy Hannah, had to be locked in a small room to keep her away from the heating stove. She had been confined in that room for three years. In that same year land was purchased in Section 21, Knox County. A two-story building was erected with ample ventilation, many windows to allow light into the rooms and supplied with a number of bathrooms. In 1876 a second wing was added to the facility.
The 1881 Knox County report was quite favorable. The yearly cost of operating the facility was $8250. At that time there were 105 residents (28 were insane, but none were secluded or restrained). The inspector stated that the establishment was first class in every respect. The Knox County Board chose to continue with a nursing home to serve constituents. The Alms House was torn down just before the present day nursing home was built in 1966 at a cost of $2.8 million.",1967,"Knoxville, IL",Gothic,
Illinois,Lake County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lake_County_Poor_Farm,1847,,1855,Demolished,Single Building,,Lake County Nursing Home | Winchester House,"At a special meeting of the Lake County Commissioners Court in October 1847, it was decided to purchase 190 acres of farmland from Alva Trowbridge, also a commissioner at the time, for $2,025 ($57,045 today) to be used as a poor farm. Located at what is now the Northwest corner of Milwaukee Ave. and West Winchester Road on the edge of Libertyville, the farm included a comfortable farmhouse, barn, as well as a small wooded area around 10 acres in size. However, the commissioners soon realized that their plan was more expensive than they had originally anticipated, leading the newly constituted board of supervisors to adopt a resolution on November 15, 1850 to sell the farm and send the poor away. The board’s decision led to warring editorials in local papers about the pros and cons of a poor farm along with a large number of residents protesting the sale at a crowded meeting on December 6, 1850. Because of the protests, the board rescinded their previous resolution, retaining the farmhouse along with 35 acres. The controversy over the poor farm wasn’t over yet though, with residents arguing over whether it should be paid for by Libertyville or Lake County. Eventually after much back-and-forth and two separate injunctions in the local court, the issue was put to a vote. At a meeting of Supervisors on May 11, 1853, the vote count found 636 in favor of county support to 531 for township support, clearing the way for the construction of an almshouse in 1855.
According to the newspaper accounts of the time, the poor farm offered “little more than food and shelter” for its residents, made up largely of unwed mothers, people dealing with alcoholism or mental illness, and those who simply had nowhere else to go  (History). The earliest residents of the farm lived in a cramped, ill lit, two-story brick house with little to no ventilation. Men and women were kept separate, with women sleeping on the first floor, men on the second, and an enclosed porch being used to house people suffering from mental illness. Residents who weren’t bedridden were expected to work to help pay for their own upkeep, producing beef, raising chickens, and attending to the vegetable garden and orchard. In 1870, Charles Appley was elected as the first director for the poor farm. In 1883 an annex with iron bars on the doors and windows was built to house inmates dealing with mental illness (some of whom were kept locked in their rooms day and night). Another feature of the farm was a pauper’s cemetery for residents who could not afford to be buried elsewhere.
By the early 1910s, there were fifty-two people living at the farm, in addition to the three women and one man the county hired to care for residents and to help tend the one hundred and fifty acre farm. On November 9, 1912, the State Charities Commission inspected the farm, and in its report, recommended the immediate removal of residents suffering from mental illness along with repairs to the almost sixty-year-old almshouse. The removal of mentally ill residents would eventually be accomplished, although not without changes in state law all but forcing the supervisor to do so.
Then, on March 16, 1918, a scandal erupted when it was revealed that a twenty-six year old resident of the farm named Lina Larsen, who was described in the papers as a “half-wit,” was pregnant (Libertyville Independent 1918, p.1). A meeting of the Board of Supervisors was held in Waukegan on March 21, where the now seventy-year-old Appley was questioned about the matter. After the meeting adjourned, a reporter from the Waukegan Daily Sun, attempting to interview a committeeman, was told only that “He admits he is guilty” (Libertyville Independent 1918, p.1). Crying, Appley begged the reporter not to put his name in the paper, saying that he would “pay any sum necessary to hush matters up,” but the damning conversation was published anyway in the next day’s edition of the paper (Libertyville Independent 1918, p.1). Charles Appley resigned on Friday, April 19, and on Thursday, April 25 his son, Schuyler Appley, was appointed superintendent of the farm.
In 1926, the seventy-year-old almshouse underwent a series of major renovations, including widened stairways, modern plumbing, and additional bed space, allowing for up to 90 residents who required medical care. The people of Libertyville took a certain amount of pride in the farm, with the County Board Chairman Martin Ringdahl declaring in 1928 that he “couldn’t find a weed” and compared the farm to those of Samuel Insull and J. Ogden Armour. Then, on October 29, 1929 the markets fell, marking the beginning of what would become known as the Great Depression. Predictably, as factories closed and bread lines grew, more and more people turned to the farm, which at one point had one hundred and twelve residents. Among the farm’s residents during this time was a man who, despite having lost his wealth in the crash, insisted on remaining impeccably dressed despite his circumstances. In 1932, the county estimated that it spent 96 ¢ per day (around $17.26 today) to feed, house, and clothe each resident of the farm.
By 1940, the same year residents stopped working the farm, its name was changed again to the Lake County Nursing Home. In 1973, the current five story nursing home was built at a cost of $2.5 million ($ $13,782,995 today) and renamed once again, becoming Winchester House, completing the sites transformation from poor farm to nursing home. In 2020, after occupancy of Winchester House needed repairs to the structure had mounted and occupancy had declined, the remaining occupants were moved to the Thrive Lake County facility in Mundelein, which is the first new skilled nursing care facility to open in Lake County in more than 20 years.  In 2021, the Winchester House was demolished.
Today there isn’t anything left of the original farm, except for the small cemetery with a white fence around it and a small bronze plaque honoring some of the residents of the farm that were known to be buried in this pauper’s cemetery.",,"Libertyville, IL",,

By 1859, the question of whether to build a county supported poorhouse in McHenry County was rejected by voters, but it wasn’t long before the issue returned. By fall 1883, McHenry County took its first steps toward establishing a county almshouse and insane asylum. Almshouse sponsors protested against the inhumanity of practices that lumped the poor and mentally ill together. Since men, women and children shared the same space, it was difficult to keep order. Little wonder there were a number of illegitimate births. McHenry County’s board of county supervisors agreed in 1884 to spend $25,000 to buy land and erect buildings for a “poor farm.” It bought 113 acres from J. C. Allen for $6,000. An addition, exclusively for the mentally ill, was added in 1900 at a cost of $12,366.
The McHenry County Farm Home & Hospital (the name was changed to Valley-Hi Nursing Home in 1959) featured offices, men’s and women’s dormitories and separate dining rooms, a hospital, laundry room, sunroom, library and a myriad of farm-related structures including hog and dairy barns, smokehouse, a chicken house, machinery shed and orchard. 
In 1915, it cost the county $2.51 a person a week to care for the 64 “inmates” living at the McHenry County poor farm. Records indicate costs reached $19,153 a year for 48 inmates by 1921. But less supplies on hand and farm products sold, the cost for a single year was $11,284.
McHenry County used the 1884 buildings until 1959, when voters approved construction of a $285,000 bond issue to construct a new building and renovate an old one into an employee dormitory. One of the original buildings was razed in 1960, when farm operations ceased. The other was leveled eight years later.",,"Woodstock, IL",,
Illinois,McLean County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=McLean_County_Almshouse,1859,,1860,Preserved,Single Building,,McLean County Poor Farm | Maple Grove Nursing Home,"In 1859-1860, the McLean County Board of Supervisors purchased 220 acres from John Grove Myers and established the county’s first permanent poor farm. Additions were made in 1888 (80 acres) and 1904 (62 acres). The buildings, which eventually included a superintendent’s house, residential quarters, washhouse, stables and various outbuildings, were situated on a 20-acre site just west of U.S. Route 51. In December 1864, there were 32 “inmates” at the Farm. The “hopelessly insane and idiotic,” numbering about a half dozen, were kept in unheated cells. “To our mind,” The Pantagraph remarked, “it is sheer brutality and cruelty to keep these unfortunate persons in cold rooms when the thermometer is twenty degrees below zero, but we may be mistaken.”
June 1877, The Pantagraph described the pitiful state of many of Poor Farm’s 50 some residents: Formerly “strong men and women from whom the light of reason has been taken away by its Giver ... fragments of once prosperous and gleeful families, the wrecks of blasted hopes and ruined lives, young women at whose breasts suckle babes brought unto the world in shame, and young men whom dissipation and sinful practices have brought from the glory of manhood to the level of the most groveling beasts.” The McLean County Poor Farm, simply put, presented “one of the saddest sights that mortal eyes can view.”
State inspector Anna Hinrichsen visited the Farm in October 1915, issuing a scathing report the following January. In it, she criticized the lack of support staff to care for the 91 residents, 16 of whom were women. “This institution,” Hinrichsen added, “employs the smallest amount of help in proportion to the population of any almshouse in Illinois.” The report noted the peeling exteriors and grimy interiors of the residential buildings. “More attention is given to the domestic animals than to inmates, and they are better housed,” was one typically blunt assessment. Over the years, the Poor Farm was home to profoundly troubled individuals. In 1894, there was the “Electric Man” William Woodard, a former Danvers resident known for his “lectures” on the electrical currents he believed permeated his body. And then there was “John the Baptist,” a resident whose name and personal history were a complete mystery. “He is a religious maniac, but will only talk when spoken to,” noted The Pantagraph. “He is a German but speaks fairly good English.” John the Baptist died in March 1900 having spent most of his final four decades under the care of the county.
In 1953-1954, the county converted the Poor Farm into the Maple Grove Nursing Home. Twenty years later the McLean County Nursing Home in Normal opened and the land comprising the old Poor Farm was put on the auction block. Russell O. Shirk, a founder of Beer Nuts Inc., purchased 320 of the 360 acres, including the collection of buildings. Today, the old Poor Farm site is private property and not open to the public.",1970s,"Bloomington, IL",,

Illinois,Montgomery County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Montgomery_County_Almshouse,"March 10th, 1806","1807, 1871 (current building)",Fall 1807,Active,,Henry Sims (1870 almshouse),*Montgomery County Poorfarm | Charles Johnson Home (1954-1971) | Montgomery County Geriatric & Rehabilitation Center (1972-Present),"The question of establishing a county poor farm in Montgomery County was first considered at a public meeting, held at the residence of John Davis in Norristown on January 23, 1801. Despite this it was not until March 10th 1806 that the county first passed an act establishing the county poor farm and authorizing its construction. By the fall of 1807 the construction was completed and the farm was in operation. It was located in Upper Providence Township, two miles from Phoenixville. By 1885 the alsmhouse property extended 298 acres, of which 245 were under cultivation and four more under garden husbandry. In 1821 the originals almshouse building caught fire and burned down, but was rebuilt that same year. In 1867 a fire consumed many of the hospital's outbuildings, causing them to be rebuilt that summer. These buildings included the wagon-house, slaughter-house, sheep-stable, barn-yard wall, corn-crib and chicken-house.
In 1870 it was deemed the 1821 almshouse was not suitable for its purpose and construction of a few almshouse was begun. The new almshouse building was constructed between 1871-1872 and designed by architect Henry Sims on the plan popular with Pennsylvania almshouses at the time. It was two hundred and forty-four feet long, from seventy-five to fifty feet wide, and three stories high, surmounted by a stone belfry. A two story central wing extends to the buildings rear and likely housed the institutions kitchen and cafeteria on the first floor and chapel on the second. The building was constructed entirely of locally quarried red sandstone and continues to stand to this day. The building was heated by steam, which was provided for by three large boilers installed in an adjacent building in 1874.
On March 21, 1872 a fire consumed the 1821 stone almshouse and took the lives of 6 male patients. Fortunately though, the new building was near completion and the remaining paupers were not left homeless by this tragedy.
On the property were two other buildings used to housed the counties indigent. One, a three story stone building constructed in 1838 was used at the hospital. In the basement of this building was also the accommodation for the institutions male insane patients. The male insane floor contained 11 rooms or ""cells"" measuring roughly 7 foot square in their dimensions. The second stone building was also three stories tall including the basement and constructed of stone. On the second and third floor were the female insane patients. The basement story of this building was occupied by the colored paupers of the institution.
In 1900 and addition to the 1871 was constructed of the same stone and joined to the building via a corridor running off of the eastern wing. These buildings were remodeled in 1940 and the original gabled roof and belfry were removed from the 1871 building. In the later 1960s the eight story ""North Building"" was constructed. Like many county almshouse the focus of the institution is now on geriatric services, and it continues to serve as the county nursing home. It provides 650 full time jobs and provides a full range of physician and nursing services, clinics and X-ray, physical, occupational and speech therapies, recreation and activities.
A potters field cemetery was on the almshouse premises. In 1885 it took up one acre of enclosed ground.

Taylor to watch over the county's poor. In June of 1853, 37 acres were purchased for $900 and farmed until 1860, when the land was sold and a 180-acre farm was purchased in Rural Township. Fred Weyerhauser of Coal Valley was given the contract to build a poor house on this site for $3,000. The 40-by-60 foot building was 3-stories high. The first 18 inmates were moved into the new structure in 1861. In 1869 the building came into use as an insane asylum until the state opened the nearby East Moline State Hospital in 1895. In 1946 this original building was remodeled and turned over to the County Farm Association for use as a boys' school.
A building was constructed for $19,873 by Collins Brothers of Rock Island and dedicated December 2, 1904 after the infirmary had burned December 29, 1902 in -6 degree weather. Fortunately no lives were lost but it brought attention to the need of a newer & safer building. By November 1950 voters approved a $750,000 bond issue (75% of that was paid by the state) to construct a new building. Construction started the following February and the name changed to Oak Glen, honoring Joe Oakleaf & Glen Bull, both county supervisors who served many years on the county home committee.",2009,"Coal Valley, IL",,

This farm originally containing 175 acres under the Almshouse Law using log buildings for many years until the brick building was constructed. The idealistic notion, that people would gladly work for their subsistence, soon met reality. The poor farm became an orphanage, a jail, an insane asylum, and a place for refugees, i.e. a social dumping ground for the outcast and deplored.

Illinois,Sangamon County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sangamon_County_Poor_Farm,,,1851,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Sangamon County first created a home to care for the poor, feeble, disabled and mentally ill in 1851, four years after famed social reformer Dorothea Dix wrote a scathing commentary about the county’s practice of keeping paupers and the insane in the Sangamon County Jail. (Prior to 1844 or ’45, according to Dix’s letter, the county imposed a year’s indenture on anyone found to be a pauper; by the time she wrote in 1847, however, officials had decided it was cheaper to house them in the jail.)
In 1851, the county board bought a property known as “Two Mile House,” a 115-acre site that included a former tavern. It was  named because it was about two miles north of the city proper. That original poor farm was turned over to the Sangamon County Agricultural and Mechanical Association in 1869 for use as a county fairgrounds. It now is part of the Illinois State Fairgrounds. To replace that property, the county paid $20,000 for 380 acres of land 1.5 miles east of Buffalo as the site for the new farm. About 200 acres were immediately sold off. Later descriptions of the farm give varying sizes for the property, from 177 to 188 acres. Officials sought bids to build a poor house on the property in July 1870. A two-story, 44-room building was built to house 100 people, men in the east wing and women in the west, with a large hall, dining room, sitting rooms and medical areas in the middle, along with offices and staff quarters.
The number of poor farm residents was frequently above the design capacity of 100 during the 74 years the farm operated – usually about 150 people lived there, and at times the population approached 200. The vast majority were men. Most residents were old and incapacitated in some way. The poor farm eventually became an anachronism, and with the number of residents dropping –only 58 people remained in the home by 1944 – the county board closed the facility and sold the property. Residents were transferred to boarding homes or, in the case of the mentally ill, to state institutions.
Most of the farm’s buildings were demolished. The only remnants today are the brick shell of one outbuilding and a tiny, neglected cemetery located on a dirt road that runs south from Old U.S. 36. Only one of what might be 100 graves appears to be maintained.",1944,"Buffalo, IL",,

Illinois,Scott County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Scott_County_Poor_Farm,,,1861 (Original location),Preserved,Single Building,Johan J. Wiley,Scott County Home,"The first Scott County Home was located three miles north of Lexington, the first county seat and was built in 1861, 41 years after the establishment of Scott County by the Indiana Legislature, on 110 acres by James Hallenbeck. This home was used until 1879 when the Courthouse was moved to Scottsburg, the new county seat. The two-story brick structure was built around 1890 to replace an earlier frame building on the same site.  The Indiana Board of State Charities and Corrections was established in 1899 and was required by Indiana law to examine the condition and management of the county homes and make an annual report to the Governor for the use of the Legislature.  Under the reporting system by the board, county asylums greatly improved.
While the acreage surrounding the home was reduced greatly over the years, the building continued to function as a poor house until 1973.  At this time offices for Scott County public services and government moved in and a few remaining residents were relocated. The building continued to function in this capacity until 1995 when an addition to the Scott County Courthouse fulfilled the need for extra space. Of the 92 county homes, only 31 remain standing.  The Scott County Home remains unaltered in regard to architecture, location, and interior layout.  Those changes that have been made throughout the years are largely superficial and could easily be restored to their original. On May 26, 2000, the Scott County Home was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Illinois,Tazewell County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tazewell_County_Poor_Farm,1866,,1871/1900,Demolished,Single Building,,,"An initial proposal in August 1866 to purchase Lemuel Allen’s farm for $7,000 for use as a Poor Farm was rejected by the Tazewell County Board. After further investigation and deliberation, by May 1871 the county had agreed to the purchase of the 211 ½-acre farm of James Smith in Elm Grove Township and to prepare it for occupancy for a total price of $4,550.10. Allensworth writes, “There were at that time nineteen paupers in the home in the care of Mrs. E. Hall, who had been engaged as matron, with Dr. Bumstead as physician. . . . Not all the paupers in the County were lodged at the Poor Farm. In 1872, at a May meeting of the Board, it was shown that since the building of the Poor House, the sum of $1,624.07 had been paid out by the county on account of the poor. For the same time — that is, from the August term, 1871, to the February term, 1872 — the county had paid the current expenses of the Poor Farm $5,997.31, and had sold property from the farm to the amount of $1,097.85. The net expense of the Poor Farm was, therefore, $4,899.46, from which cost must be deducted the improvements made, making a net cost of the paupers at the Poor Farm $2,344.56.”
By the 1890s, the facilities at the Poor Farm were no longer adequate, and the County Board moved to finance the construction of new buildings. To find out how to improve the Poor Farm, a county committee toured poor farms in other Illinois counties that had more modern facilities. The county opted for a plan modeled closely on Ford County’s Poor Farm, and the new buildings were completed on May 18, 1900, at a total cost of $18,377.74.
Eventually changes in how society provides for the underprivileged led to the closing of the Poor Farm, which was turned into a children’s home and a later a nursing home before the old structures were replaced with the current county facilities. The Poor Farm cemetery still exists, however, in a grove about a half-mile behind the TCEMA and TCHD facilities, where one may find a monument erected in 1910 “In Memory of the Unfortunate of Tazewell County.”",,"Tazewell, IL",,

Illinois,Warren County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Warren_County_Almshouse,,,1858,Demolished,Single Building,,Warren County Home,"In 1839, county commissioners were authorized to establish “poorhouses,” if they so wished, and Warren County built its first such facility in 1858, a “county farm”, on 120 acres purchased in Lenox Township, five and a half miles south of Monmouth. A frame building, a story and a half in height, was erected at a cost of $3,000. An annex in the rear housed “the insane.” The farm was as much as possible self-sustaining, with produce, dairy, meat and poultry raised on the premises. The farm’s first resident, Henry Hopper, was one of Warren County’s earliest settlers, having arrived in 1834. At the age of 40 he had been injured in the head in a sawmill accident. When he died in 1887, Hopper’s obituary noted that “after that time his mind was never quite right.” Before the accident, though, “he was an industrious and hard working man, well liked by his neighbors. He has no relatives in this city and it is doubtful he had any anywhere else.“
As the Progressive Era began to take root at the turn of the 20th century, the county board felt pressure to build a modern facility that was more sanitary and spacious. In 1903, a brick structure replaced the original building, erected at a cost of $50,000. Containing 57 rooms, the new county home was a model of modernity. It was served by two deep wells equipped with electric pumps. Outbuildings included a dairy barn, poultry house and vegetable cellar. Milk was supplied by 15 purebred Holstein cows, while 250 hogs and 800 chickens were raised each year. In 1912, a committee of the board of supervisors recommended discontinuing the terms “County Farm,” “Poor Farm” and “Alms House,” and instead calling it the “Warren County Home.”
In 1949, the Public Assistance Code forbade county homes from taking in poor but physically healthy people. Instead, they were issued monthly welfare checks and given assistance to help them live independently. All county homes in Illinois were decommissioned by the state in 1967. The Warren County Home continued for a time as a nursing facility, operated by superintendent Betty Killip, who resided there with her family. Community groups, such as the nearby Larchland Ladies Aid Society, volunteered at the home — especially to celebrate birthdays. When Applegate Inn opened in the former Monmouth Hospital in 1970, the remaining 23 County Home residents were transferred there. An auction of the facility’s contents was held in September 1970. The home was later razed and a gasohol plant was built on the site. When U.S. 67 was widened to a two-lane, the county home cemetery was vacated and many of the remains were transferred to the Lenox Union Cemetery, southwest of the former home.",1970,"Monmouth, IL",,

Illinois,Whiteside County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Whiteside_County_Farm,,,,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The Board of Supervisors assembled together at the June term of 1853 to devise some means to provide for the helpless poor of the county. After due consideration a committee was appointed for this purpose, consisting of W. C. Snyder, William V. Wetzell and James M. Pratt. The committee immediately set to work and matured their plans. A farm of 240 acres, of which one-half was inclosed and under cultivation, was selected, in Union Grove Township. It contained a good rock house and outbuildings. This farm could be bought for $25 per acre, one-half down and the balance in one and two years’ payments. The report of the committee was accepted by the Board, and the farm purchased, which was called the County Poor Farm. This answered the purpose for many years. A more suitable location, one convenient to the railroad and the county seat, became desirable.
The Supervisors took the matter under consideration, which resulted in the appointment of James M. Pratt, L. S. Pennington and H.R. Sampson as a committee to make a new selection of grounds and erect necessary buildings. The committee selected108 acres of land on; section 23, township 21 north, range 5 east, on the line of the Northwestern Railroad, which could be purchased for $45 per acre. This selection was approved by the Board, and the committee was instructed to purchase the farm, and erect the necessary buildings, at a cost not to exceed $15,000 for the whole. Switzer & Kennedy received the contract for putting tip the house, barn and out-buildings. The whole was completed in 1870, and at a cost of $13,448. The building is 50 by 72 feet, three stories high, with basement, and constructed of brick. It is divided in two parts for the convenience of the male and female occupants.
The basement is divided up into apartments for kitchen, dining-room, store-rooms, bath-rooms and cellar. On the first floor are bed-rooms, a parlor, a sitting-room and a vestibule. The second is arranged for sleeping-rooms, with ample closets. The general construction of the building is substantial and the architecture attractive. Every convenience is considered for making the county wards comfortable and at home. The soil is rich and well adapted for agriculture. The larger and smaller fruits are cultivated at the farm with success. This eleemosynary institution is very creditable to the authoritiçs and citizens of Whiteside County, and gives assurance that while they are supplied with the wants and luxuries of life, they are not forgetful of the poor. W. F. Barnum is the present Superintendent of the farm. He is paid $850 for his services. Expenses for the year ending Sept. 1, 1884, was $6.343.67.
Source: Portrait and Biographical Album of Whiteside County 1885
As the population of the county increased, so did the number of insane people, and it was deemed necessary to make some suitable provisions for them. The subject was brought to the attention of the Board of Supervisors, and they made an appropriation for a building which was to be erected on the Poor Farm. A committee was appointed to draw up plans and specifications for the building, and an estimate of the expense. The plans and specifications, with an estimate of the cost, was presented to the Board at a special meeting held in December, 1874, and were adopted. The contract was let to Messrs. A. & J. A. McKay. In November,1875, the building was completed, and accepted by the committee. The total cost of the building was $7,429.47. This building stands near the Farm house. It is a large two-story and basement structure, built of stone and brick. It contains 16 cells, with large corridors and halls for the accommodation and recreation of the inmates.",,"Morrison, IL",,

Illinois,Williamson County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Williamson_County_Poor_Farm,,,1840,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Williamson County was formed in late 1839, and during the year of 1840, the Williamson County Court appointed Overseers of the Poor, and up to 1861, when the county bought the poor farm, there were a great many sickly people in the county. Joab Goodall was named Overseer of the Poor in 1840 and Robert C. Thompson was for two years one of the Supervisors of the County and Overseer of the Poor. This farm was fitted up as a home for the poor of the county. In 1870 a one-story brick building, 18×80 feet, was erected thereon for the county, and the northeast quarter of said quarter section was sold by the county to W. J. Spiller for the sum of $362.50, and conveyed by deed dated September 23, of that year, the consideration being applied in payment of the cost of said building. A frame house of the same dimensions had previously been erected, and the cost of both buildings was about $2,500. These buildings are ample and comfortable, as an asylum for the paupers, who average about thirty in number from year to year, and who ate supported by the county at an average annual expense of $1,300 to $1,500. Prior to the purchase of this farm, the dependent poor were supported by appropriations made by the county court, and in this manner a few are yet partially supported outside of the county poor asylum.
In 1870, Jeremiah Cash took charge of the Poor Farm, and ran it for seven years. He then bought a farm near Marion, which he ran for four years and again took charge of the Poor Farm for three years more. The land was divided east and west when Route 37 was built through the center of it and at various stages it was reduced in size as lack of county need for such a sizeable tract dictated.
In June of 1946, the property was sold by the county board at public auction with the high bid taken by Marion funeral director and ex-sheriff G.J. Frick for $8,800. Buildings which were used for the housing of the county’s helplessly poor as late as 1930 were still around when Frick bought the property but had been picked over and stripped by thieves. The property on the west side of Route 37, was later put into use as the location for the Marion Drive In Theater which lasted until about the early 1970’s and then was bought for use by WDDD.  The land on the east side of Rt 37 is in current use by the VFW.",1946,"West Marion, IL",,
Illinois,Winnebago County County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Winnebago_County_County_Poor_Farm,1853,,1854/1883,Demolished,Single Building,,Winnebago County Almshouse,"The Winnebago County Board of Supervisors voted to look for available land for purchase in 1853.  It was decided to buy the farm of John DeGroot located on Elmwood Road. The need for housing was a problem almost immediately when a cholera outbreak filled the small farmhouse to capacity. The County Board decided to move the house to land located on North Main Street at the present day site of the River Bluff Nursing Home. This was a time when services for the mentally ill consisted of confining them, not caring for them. The conditions under which they lived was no better than if they were animals. During warm weather, the completely insane were kept in a “stockade” that was open to the elements. During inclement weather and colder temperatures, they were penned in cells that were placed near the kitchen wall. When the temperatures rose, the stench that came from these inmates was “unhealthy and unbearable.”
In the fall of 1856, there were 49 people served by the farm during the year and eight of the residents died. It was decided that the county would place a “potter’s field” cemetery in back of the property.  At first, only the inmates who passed away were laid to rest behind the building. Later it would be expanded to include unidentified transients, suicides and those who could not afford a “proper funeral.” In 1861, the farm served 39 persons, six of whom were insane. Three of these had to be confined. Wadley Favor was superintendent of the farm during this time. The Winnebago County Board of Supervisors would arrange annual visits to the home to make sure the “clients” were properly cared for. These visits were usually a big deal and held with “much fanfare.” The County Board granted permission in 1863 for an annex and the next year a 22 foot square outbuilding was built with an 8 foot ceiling.  It housed, according to the records, “three insane persons, two raving lunatics, and one entirely naked man whom it is impossible to keep clothed.” Other reports from 1863 state that the main building housed 36 inmates. The farm was by this time self-sustaining, raising its own crops and livestock.
An 1873 newspaper article includes a description of the poor house at this time: “a frame building that had two stories 26 by 40 feet that housed 21 cells and a bathroom.” An article in 1875 stated that the Superintendent of the time, George Weaver visited the Elgin Asylum to see if they had any openings for insane patients. The Superintendent of the Elgin facility refused Weaver’s request explaining that Winnebago County had a quota of twelve for insane patients and that they had already exceeded their limit and sent twenty. He explained that Winnebago County had a “larger proportion of insane persons than any other county in the state.” The county sent twenty insane persons to be held at Elgin and there were nine more confined at the poor farm.
In 1883, a new two story building was built and renamed the Winnebago County Almshouse. It used a “brick veneer to cover a wooden frame”. The day of March 5, 1884 began with bitter cold temperatures but that didn’t discourage an amazing 600 people that arrived to visit the brand new Almshouse.  They rode trains from cities all over Northern Illinois. Sleighs were there to meet the trains to take the visitors the rest of the way to the home from the depot located at the bottom of the bluff on the the Rock River. Visitors were very impressed with the ornately decorated reception rooms with chandeliers and carpets. The “cells” as they had previously been called, were now referred to as “apartments” and plainly but nicely furnished. In 1893 Alexander Collier was the Superintendent of the Almshouse. There were sixty four inmates on the 200 acre farm. One great advantage of the new building built in 1883 was that the violently insane were separated from the others.
By November of 1904, the almshouse was found to be in bad shape. The newspapers claimed it was dirty, dingy and not fit for anyone to live in. In 1905, it was decided to transfer the insane patients to the Bartonville Insane Asylum. The County Board also decided to listen to Dr. Crawford at the Almshouse and create a sick ward at the poor farm that would include an operating room. The emphasis of the new ward would be the medical treatment of Rockford’s poor.  In 1907, an inspection showed the almshouse to be greatly improved with a separate house for any contagious diseases, something that the staff had requested for many years.
In July of 1930, the Winnebago County Almshouse got a new look. Superintendent Conklin told the Rockford Republic reporter that all eighty of their beds were filled. He went on to explain that they had to turn some very needy people away because they just “could not care for anymore.” During this time, this time the back of the building was used as a county hospital and added thirty beds and it once again was called the Winnebago County Poor Farm. The county finally voted to expand the building portion and construction was beginning on the 136 feet by 32 wide addition.  It would provide the home with a much needed hospital that would hold a hundred more beds. By 1932, the Winnebago County Poor Farm was in financial straits.
Smaller townships in the surrounding area agreed to pay the farm for providing care for their poor and did not follow through with their part of the bargain. They were behind almost $45,000. They estimated a cost of over $.70 per patient per day for the home and almost $2.00 per patient for the hospital to run the Poor Farm. An average day at the farm saw over one hundred patients in the home plus another thirty five in the hospital. Those patients who were physically able helped with whatever farming or housekeeping chores that were needed. But many of the inmates were too sick or too old to be much assistance. By 1949, the financial struggles to keep the hospital and home open caused the County to look at other options. The idea that the county decided upon was to turn the poor home portion into a nursing home. This plan would shift the responsibility from the township to the state. The land was still used as a farm with livestock.
The later part of the 1950’s, the decision was made to use the farm to grow crops to feed the livestock which would be used to supply the milk and meat used at the nursing home. This decision would reunite the two entities for the first time in five years. Previously, the County Farm and the County Home for the Poor were conducted jointly for over seventy years until 1953 when they were separated. In the 1960’s, the livestock was sold off and the County entertained the idea to turn the farm portion of the land into the River Bluff Forest Preserve but that idea was eventually rejected. In 1968, a referendum was passed to build a replacement for the 80 year old building that had once again, grown dangerously overcrowded. The old building was filled with 204 patients with another 70 on the waiting list. The beautiful new building was opened in 1971. It continues to care for elderly patients needs whether it is rehabilitation so they can return home after an illness or surgery or long term care.",,"Rockford, IL",,

Illinois,Chicago Home for Incurables,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chicago_Home_for_Incurables,,,1898,Preserved,Single Building,,Home for Incurables,"Established in 1886, the Chicago Home for Incurables has a long and storied past, which began with a $625,000 bequest from Chicago philanthropist Clarissa C. Peck. At the time, it was the largest philanthropic donation ever made by a woman in the US. In 1898, the Home was built at 56th Street and Ellis Avenue—the location of the Young Memorial Building today—to care for individuals in Cook County with conditions that were then deemed ""incurable,"" including tuberculosis, rheumatism, paralysis, and locomotor ataxia (known today as tabes dorsalis). The Home accommodated 125 patients, who had access to lawns with shade trees and swinging hammocks, reading rooms, and a parlor on every floor. Patients were provided with wheelchairs, and male patients could go to a smoking room to ""indulge to their hearts' content in the use of their favorite brands.""
The Chicago Home for Incurables included a 68-bed ward dedicated to caring for patients with advanced cases of tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease that typically affects the lungs but can attack any part of the body. Occupying the south wing of the home, the TB ward was established by Otto Young. In the 1920s, University of Chicago researcher Alexander A. Maximow, MD, provided a new understanding of TB when he reproduced the disease in lung tissue isolated from rabbits and traced its progression under the microscope. However, it wasn’t until the 1944 discovery of streptomycin—an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections—that a cure for TB became a reality. Subsequently, sanatoriums became obsolete, as patients with the disease no longer required multiyear periods of hospitalization.
Since the Chicago Home for Incurables was founded, society has benefited from significant advances in science, medicine, public health, and sanitation. From the time the Home was established until its closing in the late 1950s, the average life expectancy in the US rose from 47 to 67 years. The University of Chicago acquired the Chicago Home for the Incurables in 1963 and changed the name to the ""Young Memorial Building"". Since then, It has functioned as departmental space for the university's architect, security, housing, and administrative facilities. Currently it houses the administrative offices of Court Theatre, the Smart Museum, and campus security.

Illinois,Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chicago_Municipal_Tuberculosis_Sanitarium,1913,,1915,Preserved,Cottage Plan,Otis & Clark,,"The Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium (MTS) was originally designed as a 160-acre campus with buildings planned at the center of the site with a ring of trees and green space for farming that would also serve as a buffer from the surrounding community. The main administration and infirmary buildings, all constructed of brick, were organized in a straight line across the campus, with the public Administration Building at the west end of the campus and the back-of-house functional buildings—the power house and grounds-keeping buildings—at the far eastern end. These buildings were connected by subterranean service tunnels for nurses and staff. The tops of the tunnels served as raised walkways with pipe railings and brick planters. The central axis of brick buildings also served to divide the grounds into two separate sections—the men’s section to the north and the women’s section to the south. Frame cottages for men were arranged along diagonal paths with a road connecting to the men’s infirmary; a similar arrangement of cottages was constructed south of the main complex for female patients. A farm was located at the southeastern corner of the site, including a greenhouse, chicken coops, root cellar, and small dairy house that were built after the sanitarium opened in 1915. Open fields for outdoor activities were placed along the eastern edge and northeastern corner of the campus and a long, narrow pond was established near the center of the north end of the site.
A series of paved roads and walking paths served to connect the campus buildings. Historically, visitors entered from the main entrance gate at the southwestern corner of the site, at the intersection of Bryn Mawr and Pulaski Road, and followed a 1,400-foot-long driveway into the center of the campus. A secondary service entrance was located at the northeastern corner of the site at the intersection of Peterson and Central Park avenues. Both entrances featured a small brick gatehouse.
Despite progress, a national survey in 1945 identified Chicago as one of the “nation’s tuberculosis plague spots.” The city’s death rate was one of the highest in the country despite its innovative procedures and extensive antituberculosis programs. By the time MTS’s quality and care had suffered. By the late 1940s, MTS had room for 1,200 patients, but, the Chicago Tribune reported, “many patients died while seeking to cut the political red tape which frequently balked their admission.” MTS was overhauled to remove political interference in 1949 following the election of Mayor Martin H. Kennelly, with a new board headed by Dr. Ernest E. Irons, who had served as president of the American Medical Association. The entire institution was then revamped for increased efficiency to better accommodate the hundreds of critical tuberculosis cases that had been on waiting lists to enter the facility. The city’s death rate from tuberculosis declined by 20 percent in 1950 following reforms at MTS, and by the late 1950s there was no longer a waiting list for treatment.
Between 1955 and 1965, deaths from the disease decreased by 64 percent. Part of this decline was because of improvements at MTS and the city’s hospital system, but the reduction was also due to new drugs to fight tuberculosis.A sharp decline in tuberculosis cases in the late 1960s brought the first significant changes to the grounds of the MTS campus. Patients were consolidated into the larger infirmary buildings and women’s cottages and all the men’s cottages, along with several of the women’s and children’s cottages and adjacent landscaping, were demolished around 1970. After the MTS closed in 1974, the site was renamed North Park Village and divided into several sections, each with a proposed reuse. The remaining frame cottages and adjacent landscaping were razed at this time.
Most of the buildings have been reused and are part of the Peterson Park Gymnastic Center.

The Chicago State Tuberculosis Sanitarium (CSTS) opened for service in 1953, at 1919 W. Taylor St., Chicago, in the heart of the University of Illinois hospital and medical school complex. Dr. Karl H. Pfuetze, M.D., led the sanitarium as Medical Director and Superintendent until 1962, when he left to become General Administrator at Suburban Cook County TB Sanitarium in Hinsdale. Dr. Marjorie Pyle was Chief of Medical Services at CSTS and co-authored a number of articles about tuberculosis with Dr. Pfuetze. Dr. Herbert Neuhaus, formerly Chief of the Cardio Respiratory Laboratory at CSTS, assumed the title of Medical Director from 1963 or 1964 until 1982.
In September 1971, CSTS closed its tuberculosis center and converted to an accredited general hospital in December 1971, still under the direction of the State of Illinois Department of Public Health. Roalda J. Alderman was Executive Director, presiding over a facility which provided geriatric care and referral to about a thousand elderly patients each year. In 1972, the hospital opened a forty bed alcoholism treatment center, and developed out-patient clinics for birth control, sickle cell, and drug abuse.
On July 1, 1975, ownership of the Illinois Department of Public Health Hospitals and Clinics transferred to the University of Illinois. The University continued the geriatric and alcoholism services, and announced plans to expand operations to provide a primary health care center for residents of Chicago's West Side.
In 1982, the University of Illinois closed the facility and suspended operation of the unit.",1971,"Chicago, IL",,

In 1897, Winfield, Illinois, was selected as the site for a family-run rest home near what is now the main entrance to Central DuPage Hospital. The two-story frame building was set on a wooded hillside, with grounds that reached to the DuPage River. After the owner’s death in 1908, the rest home was sold. A year later, it reopened as the Chicago-Winfield Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which was operated by three Chicago-area charitable organizations.
Over the years, more land was acquired to the east. The original building was destroyed by fire, and a new sanitarium was rebuilt on the same site. By the late 1950s, most patients were being relocated to Chicago for care. In 1958, a citizens group representing the communities of Glen Ellyn, Lombard, Wheaton, Warrenville, Winfield and West Chicago was incorporated as the Central DuPage Hospital Association. In 1962, as more treatment for tuberculosis was being handled by places like Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, the sanitarium closed and sold its property to citizens seeking to open a hospital in the area—that hospital became the Central DuPage Hospital.",,"Winfield, IL",,

After the fair, the Spanish Consulate donated the building, located on Lake Michigan at Jackson Harbor to the City of Chicago for use as a fresh air sanitarium for sick children. A group of volunteer women led the effort to equip and staff the facility, raising money for operations and recruiting volunteer physicians.
The Women's Board of La Rabida made it their mission to provide a “medical refuge for sick children” and relief for ""tired and weary mothers.” Early in its history, La Rabida was saving the lives of children who suffered from illnesses and diseases associated with slum squalor and unsafe food handling practices. Children acquired severe and sometimes fatal illnesses from milk and food that had not been stored and cooled properly.
For generations, La Rabida has responded to the medical needs companion to the time. As food handling technology improved, La Rabida turned its attention to rheumatic fever which was claiming the lives of young children between the 1930s through the 1950s. The hospital gained international recognition for research that led to the eradication of the disease. In the 1960s, with the threat of rheumatic fever quelled, La Rabida made a formal commitment to treat the chronic illnesses of childhood.
Today, La Rabida employs some of the nation’s top professionals who provide treatment of lifelong medical conditions, including asthma, cerebral palsy, diabetes, Down syndrome, sickle cell disease, and developmental disabilities. It also provides Illinois’ most extensive hospital-based programs for child abuse and trauma, serving as a model for other health care institutions across the U.S.",,"Chicago, IL",,

Illinois,Kelso Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kelso_Sanatorium,,,1919,Closed,Single Building,,,"Mennonite Hospital, located at Bloomington, IL, came into being through a growing concern on the part of Mennonite leaders in the Central and Evangelical (then Defenseless) Conference churches in Central Illinois, that provision be made by and in behalf of the Church, for the carrying out of Christ's command to ""heal the sick."" They were encouraged and aided by Bloomington physicians, particularly Dr. E. P. Sloan, nationally known surgeon, who served for many years as chief of the medical staff. The Mennonite Sanitarium Association was organized on 23 January 1919, its membership consisting of delegates from the constituent churches. (The name was subsequently changed to Mennonite Hospital Association. A board of five directors was chosen, consisting of Emanuel Troyer, who served as president until his death in 1942, Benjamin Rupp, John Kinsinger, Allen Miller, and J. H. King. The board was subsequently enlarged to nine members, three being elected each year by the Association at its annual meeting in January. A property was purchased on North Main Street in Bloomington, and the first patients entered on 1 May 1919. While plans were afoot for the construction of a new building, it was learned that the Kelso Sanitarium at 807 North Main Street was available and by action of the Association it was purchased at a cost of $75,000, the purchase being made by five men making themselves personally responsible for the amount, for which fact many of them paid heavily in later years. In 1931-1932 the main building was added to the single fire-proof structure in the Kelso plant. After weathering the depression, the institution grew rapidly in favor and patronage, and the southern east wing of 45 rooms was added in 1941-1942. In 1944-1945 the Troyer Memorial Nurses' Home with a capacity of 80 was built; and in 1956 the northern east wing was completed, giving the hospital a total capacity of 130 beds.
Benjamin Rupp was the first superintendent of the hospital, serving in that capacity until 1927, at which time N. O. Hoover became administrator and held that position for more than 29 years. The 1956 administrator was Theodor F. Kaap, Jr. The hospital also operated the Mennonite Hospital School of Nursing with a usual complement of 65 girls in training.
In 1956 the institution served a total of 7,357 at an operating cost of $719,384.91. Births numbered 901. Total assets of the institution were listed by the auditor as $1,147,261.99, with a net worth of $772,354.19. Not more than 4 per cent of its patients came from its constituent churches. The hospital sought to render a service in behalf of the church and in the spirit of Christ, and the testimony of many who were served by it attested to the fact that it is serving that purpose.
In 1984 the Mennonite Hospital, Eureka Hospital and the Brokaw Hospital merged to form BroMenn Healthcare. The Mennonite Hospital facility became BroMenn Lifecare Center and from 1991-1998 provided services dedicated to enhancing quality of life. The Mennonite Hospital building was then vacated and sold to become the corporate headquarters for the Electrolux Company, manufacturer of vacuum cleaners and other products.[1]",1998,"Bloomington, IL",,

Residents lived in cottages or tents and paid a monthly fee for housing and food. Stays at the facility could last years, but in many cases this treatment of fresh air and a good diet was ineffective.
In 1939, a 90-bed sanitarium was constructed on Belvidere Street in Waukegan, adjacent to today's Belvidere Park. The building was modern in design and became nationally known for its unique architecture. By the 1940s, the emphasis on the need for fresh air was gone, and patient rooms looked much as they do today.

Illinois,Madison County Tuberculosis Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Madison_County_Tuberculosis_Sanitarium,,,1926,Demolished,Single Building,,Madison County Nursing Home,"In 1915, tuberculosis was one of the leading causes of death in the United States. To address this issue, the state of Illinois enabled legislation that allowed individual local governments to raise money for sanitariums to care for the afflicted. Led by the local advocacy group the Antituberculosis Association in 1920, Madison County authorized a property tax to be deposited into a fund which would accumulate value. As a result, no bonds would be needed to build the sanitarium. A fifty-acre lot was purchased for $40,000 from William R. Grace in October of 1921, and the first cornerstone was laid on August 7, 1925. Made entirely of brick, the structure was three stories high and could accommodate ninety to a hundred patients. Under the care of its first superintendent, Dr. D. D. Monroe, the Madison County Tuberculosis Sanitarium opened its doors to its first patients in April 1926.
Soon after opening, however, the sanitarium started to experience structural problems due to subsidence. By May small cracks appeared on the first and third floor but “otherwise nothing had been observed to indicate any unusual conditions” in the building.” By June these tiny cracks expanded to more than one inch. They grew another inch by July, and the foundation also started to show damage. At this point, the county employed structural engineers to assess the damage to determine if the subsidence was caused by the weight of the building being over code or the structural integrity of the closed mines underneath. The engineers soon found that the building did not exceed 4,000 pounds per square inch and therefore was within the building code. The study concluded that the mine integrity was the reason for the subsidence. Eventually, Madison County filed a lawsuit, and the former operator of the mines, the Donk Brothers Coal & Coke Company, was found liable and fined $100,000.
With the structure repaired, the sanitarium employed more than forty people and cared for 323 patients in 1929. However, funding became an issue. To address the financial concerns, the board decided to cultivate the land surrounding the institution. They hired a farmer to grow food for the consumption of the residents in the hopes of saving money. They provided a home on the property and paid him $50 a month for his service. The facility also employed four registered nurses, eleven attendants, full-time technicians for the lab, a physiotherapist, a part-time dentist, a bookkeeper, and other service staff including janitors, kitchen staff, and groundskeepers. Dr. D. D. Monroe served as the superintendent until 1935 when he retired and was replaced by Dr. O. C. Heger. Dr. Heger, however, stepped down in 1939 and was replaced by Dr. Joseph T. Maher.
Due to improvements in living and social conditions coupled with more effective treatments, cases of Tuberculosis started to decline by the second half of the twentieth century. By the 1960s, there was little need for the Madison County Sanitarium, and most of its patients were finding services in smaller clinics in the area. In 1968 the county conducted a study to determine the fate of the building, and they concluded that it should be sold to the county and refurbished into the Madison County Nursing Home. The tuberculosis facility closed its doors after 43 years in 1969. In the mid-1970s the building was transformed into a nursing home, but by the late 1990s the county decided to close it because the facilities were “too old and poorly designed to be effective.” In the early 2000s, the building itself was torn down and replaced by the grocery store Dierbergs in the Edwardsville Crossing shopping center.

Illinois,Morgan County Tuberculosis Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Morgan_County_Tuberculosis_Sanitarium,1871,,1917 (as a sanatorium),Demolished,Single Building,,Oak Lawn Retreat | McFarland’s Insane Retreat | Oaklawn,"Among those leading the local fight against TB in the early 1900s was Dr. T.O. Hardesty, who helped organize the Morgan County Anti-Tuberculosis Society in 1905, the second such group in Illinois. A few years later, Hardesty established a clinic and began treating patients with TB, which can cause a fever, emaciation, loss of strength, coughing, breathing difficulties and the spitting up of blood.
The state of Illinois joined the TB battle soon thereafter when the legislature passed a bill authorizing county governments to levy a tax for the purpose of establishing and maintaining TB sanatoriums, according to records of the Morgan County Anti-Tuberculosis Society. The tax dollars helped the local TB organization buy Oaklawn Retreat, a private psychiatric hospital on east side of Jacksonville, in 1917.
Oaklawn Retreat, also known at one time as McFarland’s Insane Retreat, was established by Dr. Andrew McFarland in a hilltop grove of oak trees in 1872. The main building, which was said to have been modeled after a Scottish abbey, housed mentally-ill patients from as far away as Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming. The TB association remodeled the building and renamed it Oaklawn, the Morgan County TB Sanatorium.
Few drugs were used in the early years of the sanatorium. In fact, of 78 patients treated one year, only $476.58 was spent for medication. Sick would have their beds wheeled onto a porch on the south side of Oaklawn, where they would be exposed, even in cold weather, to fresh air and sunlight, which were thought to improve the patients’ health. Patients’ average stay at Oaklawn was from 18 months to two years, according to sanatorium records
Antibiotics developed after World War II joined the fight against TB and greatly reduced the incidence of the disease. By the 1960s, the Oaklawn staff was turning more to prevention and early diagnosis as fewer patients were hospitalized at Oaklawn each year. The Oaklawn TB Clinic moved to the Medical Center on West Walnut Street in 1969, and the old sanatorium building was razed in 1981.",1969,"Jacksonville, IL",,

Illinois,Palmer Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Palmer_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,,,1913,Preserved,Single Building,,Springfield Open Air Colony | Fair Hills Residence (Current),"The Springfield Open Air Colony was a private sanatorium for people suffering from tuberculosis that operated at Chatham Road and Lawrence Avenue from 1913 until the 1940s. The Colony eventually was renamed the Palmer Tuberculosis Sanatorium, after Dr. George T. Palmer, a public health advocate and specialist in tuberculosis who was associated with the institution for its entire existence. The colony, which in 1919 charged $17 per week and up, also cared for poor people with TB, thanks to funding from Sangamon County and the Springfield Tuberculosis Association. Otherwise, the 1914 Springfield Survey reported, Sangamon County had few resources for needy TB patients.
The former sanatorium was vacant in 1954, when the longtime pastor of First Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Richard Paul Graebel, initiated a move to buy the facility as the site for a planned Illinois Presbyterian Home. Following a fundraising drive, the church bought the old sanatorium complex, which took in 26 acres, for $140,000. The first residents moved in on March 5, 1956. The facility is now the Fair Hills Residence of the Illinois Presbyterian Home.",1952,"Springfield, IL",,
Illinois,Peoria Municipal Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Peoria_Municipal_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,1913,,1919,Preserved,Single Building,"Hewitt, Emerson & Gregg",,"The sanitarium’s first permanent building opened in 1919. Incurable and highly contagious, the disease colored the way the city lived and died. It was the leading cause of death in Peoria, and the United States, for the first three decades of the 1900s. It was the second TB sanitarium in Illinois, the first downstate. In its early days, the recommended treatment stay was at least a year, including six months total bed rest. The sanitarium closed in 1973, a willing victim of decades of public health campaigns and the discovery of an antibiotic called streptomycin. By the time its last 10 patients moved to a new pulmonary disease unit at what was then Saint Francis Hospital, almost 6,000 people had been treated at the sanitarium. Some stayed for two years or longer.",1973,"Peoria, IL",,

Illinois,Rock Island Municipal Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rock_Island_Municipal_Sanatorium,,,1917,Demolished,Single Building,Cervin & Stuhr,,"In the first half of this century, most Illinois counties began to operate a TB San. This postcard, dating from 1935, shows the san built by Rock Island County in 1931.  It was designed by the prominent local firm of Cervin & Stuhr to replace a circa 1917 San that had been on the southeast corner of 17th Street and 25th Avenue.  This new San was built a block to the east at 2122 25th Avenue.   It was able to house at least 79 patients, in contrast to only 20 at the previous building. Cervin & Stuhr’s red brick building did not look institutional at all.  Although it was a restrained design, it was enhanced with details typical of the era.   In many ways, it showed similarities to the Fort Armstrong Hotel, which had been built in 1924.  Each corner had a zipper of white stonework quoins providing a strong vertical outline. There were three horizontal bands of white stonework as well.  The parapet wall had a balcony effect on the elevator tower and above the main entrance.
Rock Island County’s san operated until 1974, when it was no longer needed, because new antibiotics allowed TB to be treated on an outpatient basis.  The san was converted to the County Health Care Center, a skilled nursing facility, with a TB clinic maintained in the basement area.  The nursing home was closed in 1995.  The old san was torn down in 1999, with those who inspected it at the time agreeing its condition was very poor, despite its still attractive outward appearance.",1974,"Rock Island, IL",,
