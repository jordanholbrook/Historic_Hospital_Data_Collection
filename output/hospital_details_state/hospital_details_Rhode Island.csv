Rhode Island,Eleanor Slater Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Eleanor_Slater_Hospital,,,1994,Active,Single Building,,,"In March of 1994 the three state hospitals operated by RI Department of Mental Health Retardation and Hospitals integrated into one hospital system; the Eleanor Slater Unified Hospital System (ESH). The 495 bed public hospital consists of two campus locations: The Eleanor Slater Hospital at the John O. Pastore Center in Cranston, RI and the Eleanor Slater Hospital/Zambarano Unit in Burrillville, RI.
The hospital is licensed by the Rhode Island Department of Health and accredited by the The Joint Commission (TJC).  It treats patients with acute and long term medical illnesses as well as patients with psychiatric disorders.  Most of the patients are admitted from community hospitals or other health care facilities and require hospital level long term care.  The hospital recognizes the severity and chronic nature of the illnesses of its patients and endeavors to provide a treatment environment in which dignity, respect, and recovery are emphasized. In addition to diagnosis and treatment, the hospital focuses on issues connected to quality of living. [1]

Rhode Island,Rhode Island State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rhode_Island_State_Hospital,1864,1868,1870,Active,Cottage Plan,,"Asylum for the Pauper Insane | State Asylum for the Incurable Insane | Hospital for the Insane, Howard | Institute of Mental Health | Howard State Hospital","Eighteen frame buildings were constructed in 1870, and that November 118 mental patients were admitted - 65 charity cases from Butler Asylum, 25 from town poor houses and 28 from asylums in Vermont and Massachusetts where the state had sent them. The patients at the State Asylum were poor and believed beyond help, as is reflected in the evolution of names for the asylum. Initially it was to be called the State Insane Asylum; in 1869 the Asylum for the Pauper Insane; and in 1870 the State Asylum for the Incurable Insane. In 1885, to relieve the cities and towns from the burden of supporting their insane poor, the General Assembly adopted a resolution that the State Asylum for the Insane should serve as a receiving hospital for all types of mental disorder, acute as well as chronic, thereby merging the two. By giving over the Asylum to “undesirable” elements, the poor, the incurable, and the foreign born, the upper and middle classes thus restricted their own ability to use it. Therapy was second to custody.
In 1888, the General Assembly appropriated funds for a new almshouse to replace the frame building that had been originally built for the insane. Known now as the Center Building, the Almshouse was also designed by Stone, Carpenter and Wilson. Its name acknowledges the prevailing trend in institutional design, as evidenced in the House of Correction and State Prison, as well: the installation of a large central administration building with office and residential facilities for the staff and public eating and worship spaces for the inmates who were segregated in wings flanking the central structure. In this case, the wings housed 150 men and 150 women and includes an additional wing, the children’s “cottage” for sixty children. Opened in 1890, the three-and a half story stone building stands as a series of long buildings running north-south and interrupted regularly by octagonal stair towers. Its handsome stone work and red-brick trim and its site behind copper beach trees on a bluff overlooking Pontiac Avenue make the Center Building one of the most visually striking structures in Rhode Island.
The major improvement of the decade before the turn of the century was the appointment of Howard’s first full-time medical superintendent, Dr. George F. Keene, which signaled the introduction of professionally trained, therapy-oriented administrators at the State Farm. The new orientation manifested itself in the building plan for the Hospital for the Insane created in 1900 from designs by the prominent Providence architectural firm of Martin and Hall. Based on the contemporary practice of constructing hospitals for the insane on the cottage or ward plan, “thereby establishing small communities in separate buildings that are more easily taken care of and administered,” the plan was the first at Howard to establish a campus-like quadrangle arrangement of buildings in place of one large self-contained structure.
A key part of the new plan was a communal dining room, modeled after the one in the hospital at Danvers, Massachusetts. As a result of Martin and Hall’s recommendations, the Service Building was constructed in 1903 and included a dining room measuring 195 feet by 104 feet, which could seat 1,400 people.The master plan outlined by Martin and Hall was slow in being realized. In 1912, the Reception Hospital (A Building) was opened. With 184 beds it was intended to permit appropriate diagnosis and classification of patients as they entered the institution. This effort became a reality with the assignment in 1916 of psychiatric social workers to the state hospital.
The Training School for Nurses was opened in conjunction with the Reception Building, and when the Rhode Island Medical Society held its annual meeting there, it recorded its approval. Nonetheless, the new facility did not relieve overcrowding, and in 1913, 2000 people were sleeping on the floor at the State Hospital for the Insane. The completion of B Ward in 1916 and C Ward in 1918 responded to the population increase and at last fulfilled Martin and Hall’s plan for “simple and dignified” buildings and “plain red brick walls with pitched roofs, without any attempt at ornamentation.” Standing just west of Howard Avenue and opposite the old House of Correction, the Martin and Hall quadrangle signals the beginning of a new mode of construction at Howard - red brick buildings in a simple Colonial Revival style grouped around a quadrangle and containing dormitories, single rooms, and porches as well as treatment facilities.
The concern for professionalism at the staff level soon affected the administration as well. In 1918, the General Assembly unified the Board of State Charities with the Board of Control and Supply, which controlled state expenditure and formed the Penal and Charitable Commission. Until this time there had been considerable tension between the two Boards, the Board of Supply frequently imposing fiscal restraints on the Board of State Charities’ efforts at reform. Although some proposed plans to relieve overcrowding were postponed due to shortages caused by the First World War, the new Commission constructed a new building for the criminally insane and additional dormitories.
The old twelve foot high solid fence which shut off patients from the outside world was replaced in 1919 by a lower lattice one with a view of the surrounding countryside. This change alone symbolized the change in attitude which was articulated in the 1920 Annual Report:
“The commission tries to save dollars, but it would rather save a man or a woman. It wants to see the plants in Cranston, Providence, and Exeter a credit to Rhode Island, standing like so many Temples of Reform, Education, and Philanthropy. But it is even more desirable that its work should be represented in reconstructed Living Temples in the morals, minds and bodies of those who have been ministered to by these public administrators. For it is better to minister than administer.”
These efforts at reform in the treatment of the insane were paralleled by a new attitude towards the infirm. The Almshouse became the State Infirmary and attention was focused on the medical, not the social, disabilities of the inmates.
It was the infusion of large amounts of federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds that dramatically altered the appearance of the Howard complex and permitted, if briefly, appropriate physical accommodation for patients, inmates, and attendants. Overcrowding has been a chronic problem at Howard and only the large-scale construction program of the WPA could solve it. Despite the building effort of the 1920s, in 1933 the State Hospital, with accommodations for 1,550, housed 2,235 and was labeled the most overcrowded mental hospital in the northeast.
In the years 1935-1938 twenty-five buildings were erected for the State Hospital for Mental Disease, three for the State Infirmary, and three for the Sockanosset School. The appearance of Howard was dramatically altered by this construction which went up so fast the Providence Journal declared a “new skyline rises at Howard.”
Built in a uniform, red-brick, Georgian Revival style, the structures comprising the State Hospital and State Infirmary are grouped in campus fashion on either side of Howard Avenue. Among the most interesting are the Benjamin Rush Building, with an ogee gable inspired by the Joseph Brown House in Providence, and the cluster of Physician’s Cottages which finally permitted the hospital staff improved residential accommodations. Taken in total, the buildings constructed at Howard by the WPA incorporated a uniformity of style, scale, material, and siting that is striking. Historically they represent the coming together of national policy and local initiative. Architecturally, they present one of the most lucid statements of the Georgian Revival in Rhode Island.
But despite the tremendous improvement made possible by the WPA, by 1947 conditions at Howard had once again deteriorated due to overcrowding. The Hospital for the Insane, built for 2,700 beds, held over 3,000 patients. Increased salaries were approved to help recruit additional staff, and it was proposed that a master plan be developed. In 1947, the “Hospital Survey and Construction Act of Rhode Island,” stemming from the federal Hospital Survey and Construction Act of that year, was passed. Through it, the governor was authorized to appoint an advisory hospital council to advise and consult with the Department of Health in implementing the Survey and Construction Act. However, no immediate action was taken, and in 1949 the population at Howard reached its highest in history without significant new construction. Interestingly, in 1959 an expert from Boston declared that the conditions at Howard were shameful and yet “relatively good” compared with mental hospitals in the country. The problem stemmed not from a lack in the annual budget (Rhode Island ranked twelfth nationwide in the amount spent per patient) but in the inability to raise capital funds to match federal programs.
In 1962, the General Hospital and State Hospital for Mental Diseases merged to become the Rhode Island Medical Center. The former became the Center General Hospital and the latter the Institute of Mental Health. In so doing, Rhode Island was the first state to create therapy units for its mentally ill, an approach pioneered at the Center General Hospital. As a result, four buildings housing elderly patients were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Cranston General Hospital in order to remove the stigma of residing in a mental hospital.
In 1967, the Medical Center was divided. The Center General Hospital was designated to serve as an infirmary for the prison and the Institute of Mental Health. Both hospitals are administered by a new Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals, In 1977, the IMH was divided into nine units to deal with specific categories and regions of patients. The institution is currently undergoing another philosophical re-orientation, encouraging group homes away from the environment of Howard. The extent of this change will very likely depend on federal support, but if carried out extensively, it will help to redefine the role of Howard just as previous changes in attitude have.

Rhode Island,Zambarano Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Zambarano_Hospital,1901,,1905,Active,Cottage Plan,,Rhode Island State Sanatorium | Zambarano Unit of the Eleanor Slater Hospital,"Experience in other parts of the nation showed the advantages of open-air treatment for the early stages of the disease.  Separating these patients from the rest of the population would minimize the spread of tuberculosis. The state then considered the feasibility of building and maintaining a state sanatorium.  A sanatorium was built in the northwest corner of the state, on 250 acres of land, at Wallum Lake. The superintendent was Dr. Harry Lee Barnes.  Under his direction the sanatorium gave patients access to fresh air along with a regular schedule, good food and medical attention.
Initially the sanatorium was overwhelmed with prospective patients.  In 1909, Barnes refused admission for 181 patients because their disease was too far advanced.  Over 200 patients needed hospital care.  Still, Barnes was criticized for admitting too many patients and for not always allowing the examining physician to have the final decision concerning the admittance of potential patients.  Barnes is also noted for refusing to allow men and women patients to mingle. The care offered by the sanatorium was likely one of the factors that led to a decrease in Rhode Island’s death rate from tuberculosis.  It fell from 198.5 in 1907 to 131.3 in 1920.
A hospital to treat advanced cases of tuberculosis was established on the WallumLake property in 1917.  In the 1930’s they added a nurses home, two other buildings for staff and also the Wallum Lake House, which included a kitchen, bakery, auditorium, chapel and pharmacy.  Until 1936 the sanatorium also had a vegetable garden, hennery and piggery.  These were constructed by patients and employees.  By 1940 the original buildings were destroyed, mainly because they were considered a fire hazard.
By the beginning of the second World War, Wallum Lake's average daily census was 556, served by 330 employees. Several more buildings had been constructed and what began as an outpost had its own store, slaughterhouse, hennery, barbershop, chapel, school, fire department, post office -- even its own postcards, printed at Wallum Lake.
The war ended, the 1950s dawned, and the commercial introduction of antibiotic treatment began to improve outcomes for tuberculosis patients. Once the leading cause of death in America, TB had dropped to 10th place in 1953. Fewer than 20,000 people died of the disease that year, compared with nearly 120,000 in 1918, the height of the epidemic.
The first patients with lung disorders not caused by tuberculosis were admitted in 1955, at about the time the hospital's name was changed, to honor former superintendent Dr. Ubaldo E. Zambarano. Thirty children with developmental disabilities were admitted in 1958, and in 1961, Zambarano began to accept ""general medical care"" patients. The state closed the last TB ward in 1982, and the final such patient was discharged six years later.
Rhode Island's deinstitutionalization movement of the 1970s and '80s further reduced Zambarano's population, but the hospital survived calls to close it and the census today is 115 patients, the oldest of whom is a 95-year-old woman, and the youngest of whom is 19. Although a few patients pass through Zambarano, which is run by the state Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, the majority require long-term care. Some are bedridden. Some are comatose. Some require respirators to breathe. Some, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's and other dementias, live on locked wards. Some have lost cognition to strokes or head trauma. Approximately 120 patients are treated at the Zambarano Unit. Others (approximately 240 patients) are served at the Hospital's Cranston site, located at the John O. Pastore Center.

Rhode Island,Bradley Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bradley_Hospital,1929,,1931,Preserved,Single Building,,Emma Pendleton Bradley Home,"Bradley Hospital was the nation's first neuropsychiatric hospital for children. The hospital was named for George and Helen Bradley's only child Emma Pendleton Bradley, who was born in 1879.
Emma was stricken with encephalitis at the age of seven. The disease left her with multiple disabilities, including epilepsy, mental retardation and cerebral palsy. This tragedy sparked the Bradleys to conduct a worldwide search for a cure or a treatment for Emma's condition. Because psychiatry and neurology were in their infancy, hospitals were solely for adults and pediatric services were not yet available, the Bradleys arranged around-the-clock medical care for Emma at their summer home in Pomfret, Connecticut.
After eighteen years of treatment, Emma showed no improvement. George and Helen began to accept their daughter's fate but wanted to ensure that other families would not share their family's struggle. In their wills, both George and Helen Bradley requested that the Baton House, the family's Providence estate, be converted into a treatment facility for children. The board of trustees decided that more space and a less urban setting were necessary for the institution, and so the beautiful home on Eaton Street was sold and 35 acres of wooded land was purchased on the Barrington Parkway. The ground was broken in 1929, and two years later the institution opened its doors.
The Emma Pendleton Bradley Home was officially dedicated on April 8,1931 during a ceremony in the hospital's Pine Room. In accordance with the terms of George Bradley's will, the facility gave first preference to poor, needy children from Rhode Island. Families were only billed if they had the means to pay. And so, 25 years after George Bradley's death, the Bradleys' dream was realized. It is clear today that the dream was only the beginning. [1]

Rhode Island,Butler Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Butler_Hospital,1844,,1846,Active,Pre-1854 Plans,William Tallman & James Bucklin,Butler Hospital for the Insane | Butler Health Center,"The facility was founded in 1844 as Rhode Island's first exclusively mental health hospital. Industrialist Cyrus Butler donated heavily to the hospital, and it was named in his honor. Local Yankee philanthropist Nicholas Brown, Jr. also bequeathed a large amount of money to construct the hospital.[1]
The land Butler Hospital sits upon was originally purchased for a price of $6,000, and the original building was approximately 100,000 square feet and constructed at a cost of $89,000.
Dr. Isaac Ray, the hospital’s first superintendent, believed that each patient should be treated humanely in a clean, safe environment. His beliefs in the healing effects of quality care and the legal rights of mentally ill patients provided an important foundation upon which Butler Hospital developed its reputation.
Today, the sprawling campus is 110 acres and houses 35 buildings, which are home to many of Butler’s services and programs. Many of the original, historic red-brick buildings built in the 1800s remain standing and are still in use, today.[2]

Rhode Island,Sockanosset Boys Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sockanosset_Boys_Training_School,1866,,1881,Preserved,Cottage Plan,"Stone, Carpenter, & Willson",,"The establishment of the Howard Reservation, which includes the Boys Training School, was Rhode Island’s first attempt to provide statewide social services through publicly supported and administered institutions.
In 1866, a state Board of Charities and Corrections was established for the purpose of consolidating into one “state farm” a house of correction, a state asylum for the incurably insane, and a state almshouse. The two-fold goal was to raise standards for the indigent while at the same time lifting this burden from the local towns and cities.
There was a machine shop, a carpenter shop, a printing shop, a mason shop and a blacksmith shop where the boys learned useful trades. The boys also helped construct their own environment, so the elements that compose the structures themselves reflect the philosophy that created and guided the school throughout its history. The bricks, stone and mortar, as well as the woodwork, bear silent testimony to the benefits of honest labor.
The cottages that housed the boys were designed to give them a sense of ordered and structured home life; they were both institutional and domestic at the same time. These handsome cottages, which surround a circular driveway, were built between 1881 and 1895 and combine solid rubblestone walls, brownstone quoins, and arched windows with Stick style porches.
Wholesome recreational activities were provided by the gymnasium (built in 1898). The chapel and its infirmary addition administered the necessary spiritual and physical healing needed by the wayward youth. The current chapel (now minus the infirmary wing, which was destroyed by fire in the 1970s. In some of the photos you can see the ghost of the roof line) was built in 1891 of stone, with a shingled porch. Designed by Stone, Carpenter and Wilson, it is one of the most handsome buildings at the Howard Complex.
The Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission report on Cranston states, “Although in disrepair, the buildings at Sockanosset, beautifully sited on spacious grounds behind a stone wall, are among the finest nineteenth-century institutional buildings in the state.”[1]
After the school's closure in 1985, the buildings decayed rapidly. Within the last deacde, however, the property was acquired by private developers who have integrated some of the extant school buildings into a new shopping plaza. The centerpiece of the restoration work is the school's chapel, which has been converted into the ""Chapel Grille Restaurant.""

Ladd Center,"Prior to building the Rhode Island School for the Feeble-Minded in 1907, most patients were treated out of state at places with such charming names as the Connecticut School for Imbeciles and the Massachusetts School for the Feeble-Minded. The Ladd School started as a farm colony, based on programs in other states were patients were housed in small cottage settings, as opposed to large institutions that came later, and worked in a rural setting doing small chores, farming, and later making of clothes and household items. In 1909 they erected a girls dormitory, as the boys was full and a waiting list was established.
In 1917 the name was changed to the Exeter School, dropping the “feeble-minded”, as the term began to grow objectionable. After a decade of mismanagement, low funding, and high over-crowded enrollment, in 1928, the Exeter School was a warehouse for society's refuse. Amidst a steady and growing controversy over his policies, Dr Joseph Ladd retired on June 1, 1956. During the early seventies, the Ladd School Parents Association, an advocacy group for the developmentally disabled, brought suit against the State for running such poor institutions. In 1986, law-makers tried to get it closed because of pending legal issues (child abuse cases), and Rhode Island wanted to abolish institutions from it's mental health programs.
The last patient of the Ladd School was moved to permanent offsite, community based housing in March of 1994.
Superintendents of the facility include:
Dr. Joseph H. Ladd 1907-1956 
Dr. John G Smith 1956-1978 
Mr. George W. Gunther 1979-1993
The majority of the buildings on the property were demolished in August of 2013. The only structure remaining is the iconic yellow rounded Foggarty hospital.

Rhode Island,State Home and School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=State_Home_and_School,1884,,1885,Closed,Cottage Plan,,State Home for Dependent and Neglected Children | Rhode Island State Home and School | O’Rourke Children’s Center,"The State Home for Dependent and Neglected Children was founded in 1884 on what was previously known as “Walnut Grove Farm.” Its original purpose was to provide care to children who were neglected or dependent on the state for support. The State Home was one of the first post-Civil War public orphanages in the United States. Up until that time, large state-operated institutions called almshouses were the primary means of support for dependent children who were not fortunate enough to be placed in small, privately sponsored orphanages. Public dismay regarding the poor conditions of the almshouse and the children's exposure to adults who were charged with criminal acts or physically and/or mentally ill, led to state legislation that established the State Home.
Small cottages directed by a house parent were built to better approximate a family style of living. Children were provided with both academic schooling and the opportunity to acquire practical skills, usually by working on the farm located at the Home or through indenture. Most of the residents of the State Home were not orphans. Many were placed in the home because their parents were unable to financially support them due to one or many of the following: illness, substance abuse, and the lack of housing or employment opportunities. Some of the children had been abandoned.
The Home attempted to teach the children steady work habits by assigning them responsibilities on the farm and through the system of indenture. As soon as they were old enough, children at the Home were placed with families in the community. In return for work, children were to receive additional public schooling, and their basic needs were to be met by the family. The board overseeing the Home created a Committee on Homes to visit the indentured children and their new families to ensure that the children were receiving adequate care. Records indicate that the board was aware that some families were more interested in the child's ability to work than in providing a caring and loving environment for the child. In 1912, a ""placing out"" department was established at the Home and paid “visitors” were hired. The program was eliminated in 1919, when the newly formed Rhode Island Penal and Charitable Commission established a placing out program for all dependent children in the state. This placemen program was the precursor to the current foster care system that is today operated by the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families.
The State Home underwent numerous physical changes during its existence. Originally the Home was situated on 80 acres of land. Its physical structures consisted of a stone farmhouse (now known as the Forman Center), two wooden cottages, and a barn. The first year it housed 27 children and was staffed by 8 people. By 1900 the Home had grown considerably. Four residential cottages were built and the farmhouse was expanded to allow for a dining room, a bakery, a dormitory, a classroom, and a boiler house. A two-story schoolhouse with three classrooms and an auditorium for religious services and entertainment was also built. In addition, a well, a pond for cutting ice, a laundry, and a hospital cottage were constructed. By the late 1800s the Home housed 125 children and employed 21 staff members.
The next major renovations occurred in the middle of the 20th century. By then the State Home was renamed the Dr. Patrick I. O'Rourke Center. In 1952, the center experienced a fire in the old school house. Its replacement was an all-purpose Activities Building. Fear of additional fires and poor conditions led to the demolition of all but one of the old wooden cottages. The structures were replaced with new brick, 18 bed, and single room cottages. In 1957 the remains of 13 children who had died at the Home and were buried on the property were relocated to the Grace Church burial grounds in order for the development of the Mount Pleasant Street entrance to Rhode Island College. Six of those children to this day remain unaccounted for.
Throughout the 20th century, numerous committees were appointed to study the viability question. A 1950 study recommended that the Home serve as a temporary emergency shelter for children pending foster home placement, as well as offer permanent home facilities to children who require group care. From that point until the closure of the facility, the Home was recognized as having two roles, a reception center for the temporary housing of children awaiting foster homes and a permanent home and treatment center for children with serious emotional and behavioral difficulties.
In the 1960's and 70's public opinion regarding the Home changed significantly. Reports of substandard living conditions such as a lack of heat and overcrowded conditions reopened the question of whether or not the Home should remain open. Children running away from the institution, fires in the cottages, and other property damage, as well as allegations of abuse and neglect increasingly became a problem. There were also concerns relating to the high cost of maintaining the facility. The institution closed in 1979. Today the property is now home to the East Campus of the Rhode Island College. [1]

Rhode Island,Dexter Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dexter_Asylum,,1828,,Demolished,Single Building,,Dexter Asylum for Paupers | Dexter State Hospital,"The Dexter Asylum served as an institution for the care of the poor, aged and mentally ill of Providence from 1828 to 1957. The Asylum began through a bequest in the will of Ebenezer Knight Dexter (1773-1824), a wealthy citizen who had served on a town committee for poor relief. Dexter's gift to the town, though much needed at the time, later was seen as an anachronism--a walled and isolated ""poor farm"" in the midst of Providence's residential east side. Beginning in the 1920's, city officials, developers and assorted heirs made several attempts to change the conditions of the will, and in 1957, they finally succeeded. The Dexter Asylum property was sold to Brown University.
Ebenezer Dexter's will of 1824 left a property known as Neck Farm to Providence to be used for ""the accommodation and support of the poor of said town... and for no other use or purpose whatever."" The bulk of his estate was left to the city (then town) for the construction and upkeep of the asylum and the care of the poor. Dexter's will further called for the town to erect a stone wall around the property, forbade the town to sell Neck Farm, and specified that a town meeting of no less than ""forty freemen"" should be required for any action concerning the property.
Before Dexter's bequest, Providence had no institution for the care of the poor. Those unable to support themselves due to age or illness were cared for at town expense in private homes by caretakers who bid for the job. A committee formed soon after Dexter's death to oversee the donation, and town meetings from 1824 until the original building's completion in 1828 discussed the construction, operation and rules of the asylum.
In the mid-nineteenth century, as Providence grew, crowding became a problem at the asylum. The opening of Butler Hospital provided a new resource for the mentally ill, and some inmates were transferred there in 1847. In 1849 Thomas M. Burgess, mayor of Providence, called for either a limit on inmates or the construction of new buildings to accommodate the asylum's 190 men and women. The next year, the Board of Aldermen voted to limit inmates to 180. In 1867, the city commissioned ""alterations and improvements"" costing $120,000, and later sketches show an enlarged main building, but new buildings were not added. By the late 1870's, the inmate population had stabilized at around 100, where it would remain until the asylum's closing.
Living conditions, as depicted in early lists of rules and punishments, work records and daily menus, were hardly desirable by present standards. Visitors were permitted only once every three weeks; male and female inmates were strictly separated; the evening meal consisted of white bread and tea; and those found guilty of drinking, ""immoral conduct,"" ""loud talking or disrespectful behavior"" or faking illness to avoid work were subject to ""confinement in bridewell (a jail cell) for a time not exceeding three days, and of being kept on short allowance of food."" An 1843 observer reported one-quarter of the inmates insane, yet medical records reveal no attempt at treating mental illness beyond confinement in the ""maniac cells.""
Legal wrangles between the city and the asylum began as early as 1872, when part of the stone wall around the Dexter property was knocked down during the widening of Hope Street. The city solicitor finally determined that Providence was not legally required to rebuild the wall. The city did restore the wall, but more conflicts were to come. In the 1920's, with rising real estate values and open space at a premium, city officials first tried to break up the property and sell it for house lots, then suggested making the land a public park. In 1926, the Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld the provisions of Ebenezer Dexter's will, declaring that no part of the property could be sold--much to the disgust of city Alderman Sol S. Bromson, who declared that the city could board the inmates at the Biltmore Hotel for less than it cost to maintain the asylum. The will's stipulation that ""forty freemen"" be present for any meeting about the asylum was altered in 1940, when the state General Assembly allowed the city council to have all powers originally bestowed upon the freemen.
A 1941 article in the Providence Sunday Journal characterized the asylum as a ""well-meaning legacy of a bygone day which has made time stand still."" Vegetable farming had been abandoned in the late 1920's, and while dairy farming continued through the '40's, farm revenues were not enough to make the asylum self-supporting. In 1947, the battle to break the will resumed. Lawyers and genealogists searched through old records, trying to determine who had owned ""Neck Farm"" before Ebenezer Dexter. Could the heirs of this previous owner determine the fate of the property? Could Dexter's heirs? If the asylum was demolished, what would take its place--a housing development, a park? In 1956, Brown University President Barnaby Keeney proposed that the city sell or lease the property to the university for a gym and athletic complex: ""If and when the Courts permit the City to dispose of this land, it must honor its obligation to the Dexter Trust by obtaining the best possible income for the support of the poor... the University is in a position to help.""
Providence Mayor Walter H. Reynolds hesitated, noting that the land could provide space for as many as 150 new home sites. But in the end the Brown proposal proved the best offer; today the University's athletic complex stands on the former asylum site on Hope Street. In October, 1957, the Dexter Asylum submitted its final report to the city of Providence. Its 129-year history had come to an end.[1]

Rhode Island,Warwick Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Warwick_Asylum,1870,,,Demolished,Single Building,,Warwick Asylum for the Poor | Warwick Poor Farm | Warwick City House,"The Warwick Asylum was opened in 1870 and operated as a poor farm and almshouse for residents who were unable to support themselves and admitted men, women, and children. Patients lived in a large, wooden farmhouse that contained thirty dormitory rooms, communal dining room, a library, and separate sitting rooms and hospital rooms for men and women. According to a 1897 report, Warwick Asylum was “one of the best in the state…well-built, convenient, thoroughly heated and well located.”
Despite the poor conditions of the land, patients were made to farm and followed a strict daily schedule of work and meal times. There was also strict regulations put in place that all patients were expected to follow. If a patient was late to a meal, they would be denied that meal. There was to be no smoking, drinking, stealing, intercourse, profane language, indecent behavior, or refusal of work. Penalties for rule breaking included additional hard labor, loss of meals, loss of a day’s allowance, and solitary confinement. Patients could only leave the asylum grounds if they were granted a ticket of permission. Children were permitted to leave only to attend a nearby school.
The asylum housed anywhere from 15 to 20 patients at a time, and while some patients’ stay only lasted months, some would live their entire lives within the wooden walls of the poor house.
Warwick Asylum closed in 1943 and the main house and farm buildings have since been demolished. All that remains of the asylum are 94 anonymous headstones marking the resting place of deceased patients, which presently sits in a pine grove in Warwick City Park. In 2017 the Friends of the Warwick Commission on Historical Cemeteries and the Warwick Historical Society worked to uncover the cemetery and identify as many of the patients buried there as they could. They were successful in identifying 78 patients. While the cemetery contains 94 markers, the true numbered of buried patients is unknown.",1943,"Warwick, RI",,

Rhode Island,Newport Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Newport_Asylum,,1819,1822,Preserved,Pre-1854 Plans,Benjamin Chase,"Newport Asylum | Deaf and Dumb Asylum, Newport","In 1819 the citizens of Newport recognized the need for a poor house and asylum for those deemed less fortunate. Construction on the Newport Asylum and Poor House began a few months later on Coasters Island, a location chosen because of its seclusion as there was no bridge linking the mainland to the island at the time. A bridge would not be built until later in the 1850s. In the 18th century, Coasters Island was home to a quarantine station and smallpox hospital. The island was also the site of where 26 pirates were hanged together in 1723 after they were caught on a British ship.
The Newport Asylum and Poor House opened in 1822. Residents included the indigent, mentally ill, and those struggling with addiction. Some residents were born into poverty and had no means of supporting themselves, some were orphaned children, while others were petty criminals. A report published in 1851 listed the following as reasons for admission: “disagreement with husband,” “insanity,” “blindness,” “drunkenness,” “insane due to fall from horse,” “old age and destitution,” “imbecility of mind,” “loss of industrious husband.”
Residents were given work to perform, including cleaning, farming, weaving, and sewing. Children were educated at a school on the property. The asylum set designated times for work, meals, washing, and worship. Contact between male and female residents was strictly prohibited. Inmates who failed to comply to the rules were punished, the most severe punishment included incarceration in a small cage. It has been recorded that the asylum overseer would sometimes lock those declared insane in these solitary confinement cages permanently.
In the 1850s, the asylum’s population began to decline as residents were moved to Rhode Island State Hospital in Cranston or to a larger jail outside of Newport. Though the asylum continued to house the poor until 1883 when the asylum closed and the building was sold to the U.S. Navy to serve as the US Naval War College, a training college for naval officers.
The asylum building currently serves as Naval War College Museum and is open to the public.

Rhode Island,Zambarano Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rhode_Island_State_Sanatorium,1901,,1905,Active,Cottage Plan,,Rhode Island State Sanatorium | Zambarano Unit of the Eleanor Slater Hospital,"Experience in other parts of the nation showed the advantages of open-air treatment for the early stages of the disease.  Separating these patients from the rest of the population would minimize the spread of tuberculosis. The state then considered the feasibility of building and maintaining a state sanatorium.  A sanatorium was built in the northwest corner of the state, on 250 acres of land, at Wallum Lake. The superintendent was Dr. Harry Lee Barnes.  Under his direction the sanatorium gave patients access to fresh air along with a regular schedule, good food and medical attention.
Initially the sanatorium was overwhelmed with prospective patients.  In 1909, Barnes refused admission for 181 patients because their disease was too far advanced.  Over 200 patients needed hospital care.  Still, Barnes was criticized for admitting too many patients and for not always allowing the examining physician to have the final decision concerning the admittance of potential patients.  Barnes is also noted for refusing to allow men and women patients to mingle. The care offered by the sanatorium was likely one of the factors that led to a decrease in Rhode Island’s death rate from tuberculosis.  It fell from 198.5 in 1907 to 131.3 in 1920.
A hospital to treat advanced cases of tuberculosis was established on the WallumLake property in 1917.  In the 1930’s they added a nurses home, two other buildings for staff and also the Wallum Lake House, which included a kitchen, bakery, auditorium, chapel and pharmacy.  Until 1936 the sanatorium also had a vegetable garden, hennery and piggery.  These were constructed by patients and employees.  By 1940 the original buildings were destroyed, mainly because they were considered a fire hazard.
By the beginning of the second World War, Wallum Lake's average daily census was 556, served by 330 employees. Several more buildings had been constructed and what began as an outpost had its own store, slaughterhouse, hennery, barbershop, chapel, school, fire department, post office -- even its own postcards, printed at Wallum Lake.
The war ended, the 1950s dawned, and the commercial introduction of antibiotic treatment began to improve outcomes for tuberculosis patients. Once the leading cause of death in America, TB had dropped to 10th place in 1953. Fewer than 20,000 people died of the disease that year, compared with nearly 120,000 in 1918, the height of the epidemic.
The first patients with lung disorders not caused by tuberculosis were admitted in 1955, at about the time the hospital's name was changed, to honor former superintendent Dr. Ubaldo E. Zambarano. Thirty children with developmental disabilities were admitted in 1958, and in 1961, Zambarano began to accept ""general medical care"" patients. The state closed the last TB ward in 1982, and the final such patient was discharged six years later.
Rhode Island's deinstitutionalization movement of the 1970s and '80s further reduced Zambarano's population, but the hospital survived calls to close it and the census today is 115 patients, the oldest of whom is a 95-year-old woman, and the youngest of whom is 19. Although a few patients pass through Zambarano, which is run by the state Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, the majority require long-term care. Some are bedridden. Some are comatose. Some require respirators to breathe. Some, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's and other dementias, live on locked wards. Some have lost cognition to strokes or head trauma. Approximately 120 patients are treated at the Zambarano Unit. Others (approximately 240 patients) are served at the Hospital's Cranston site, located at the John O. Pastore Center.
