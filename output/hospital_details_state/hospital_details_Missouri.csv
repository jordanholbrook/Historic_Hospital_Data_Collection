Missouri,Farmington State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Farmington_State_Hospital,,1901,1903/1987,Active,Cottage Plan,,State Hospital Number 4  | Southeast Missouri Mental Health Center (Current) | Farmington Correctional Center (Old facility location),"Received its first patients in 1903. The state budgeted $150,000 to build the hospital itself and in 1901, an additional $120,000 went for new buildings and equipment. Five cottages were built for patients and from 1901 to 1902 a dining room, kitchen, power house, barns, laundry, ice plant, the folk building (set aside for nurses, attendants and recreation), an administration building, the Hall building, the superintendents' residences and the Harrison Building, a receiving building and acute care hospital, were constructed. Dr. William Hall admitted the first three patients in 1903 and by 1904, the population stood at 332. By 1907, 795 patients were housed at the hospital. By 1922, the hospital was so crowded the superintendent's home was converted to housing for women patients. In 1925, the Hyde Building was built and the Folk Building was converted to house female patients. Another milestone was marked in 1925 when Dr. Emmett Hoctor took over as superintendent of Farmington State Hospital, then known as State hospital Number 4.
In 1931, the diathermy machine was introduced to treat paresis, a form of paralysis. Before, physicians had induced a high fever in paretic patients by injecting them with malaria germs. While the malarial fever did help some patients, the danger of dying of malaria outweighed the benefits. When penicillin was discovered, it replaced the diathermy machine, chiefly because it was dramatically effective for treating syphillis, the major cause of paresis. In 1932, the hospital established its first community-based treatment center when it set up a clinic for mental health education and consultation in the New Madrid County Courthouse. Other clinics were set up in Mississippi and Scott Counties and today clinics can be found in Sikeston, Cape Girardeau, Kennett and West Plains. On June 6, 1940, Dr. Paul Schrader performed the first lobotomy. In the first months of 1940, 64 major lobotomies were performed at the hospital. All told, 200 lobotomies were performed at the hospital, the last in 1943. Electroshock therapy was introduced in 1942. During the 1930s and '40s, several WPA projects were completed on the hospital grounds, including utility tunnels, storm sewers and a new dairy barn. The 1950s and '60s were a period of overcrowding for the hospital. In 1954, the average daily patient population was 1,879. The recommended capacity was 1,600. By 1970, the hospital was serving 25 counties and the Alcoholism Treatment Center had been expanded to handle drug abuse patients. Treatments in practice included recreation, music and occupational therapy.
In 1972, the Blair Building, the last of the new buildings, was opened as a psychiatric medical facility. By 1975, the average daily population had fallen to 521 patients at the state hospital, but an average of 600 people were treated monthly on an outpatient basis. In 1978, Dr. Hoctor retired after a 53-year career with Farmington State Hospital, and the institution marked its 75th anniversary. By 1982, the population had fallen to 320 on the hospital grounds, the level stipulated under the conversion plan. The majority of the original grounds, and buildings for State Hospital Number 4 became part of the Missouri Department of Corrections.[1] In 1987 the facility was renamed Southeast Missouri Mental Health Center and the non-forensic patients were moved into the new building which is now known as the Danny Staples building, where Adult Psychiatric Services are provided. The Hoctor building, named after Dr. Hoctor, is now used along with the Blair building to house the SORTS program-Sexual Offender Rehabilitation Services.

The first patient was buried in the cemetery on December 29, 1903, the year the hospital opened. The last person buried there died December 29, 1960, just 57 years later. Between those dates over 1100 individuals were buried there. Records of each grave and burial are maintained by the Southeast Missouri Mental Health Center (SMMHC). After 1960, the cemetery fell into disrepair. In 1978 a group of concerned citizens restored the cemetery, removing weeds and brush and resetting stones as needed. Since that time, the cemetery has been maintained by the SMMHC. Though some of the stones have deteriorated due to age, the cemetery is well maintained and reflects its historic significance as a cemetery associated with a state-run asylum and hospital.",,"Farmington, MO",,"1,879 in 1954"
Missouri,Fulton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fulton_State_Hospital,1847,,1851,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),Solomon Jenkins (Original Building) & Morris Frederick Bell (Later modifications),Missouri Asylum for the Insane | Missouri State Hospital #1,"In 1847, the Missouri General Assembly enacted legislation to establish an asylum for the insane in the central area of the state. This institution was to provide physical care for societal ""lunatics."" Several counties were encouraged to bid for this institution. Callaway County was able to produce $11,500 and 500 acres of land, thus winning the bid. Fulton State Hospital, the first public mental institution west of the Mississippi River in 1851, admitted its first 67 patients in December.
The original building was three stories high, excluding the basement and attic. It contained 72 rooms and housed the same number of patients. The center of the building was reserved for a patient dining area, and lodging rooms for officers, attendants, and laborers. All employees of the hospital were required to live on the grounds, and had to obtain special permission from the Superintendent in order to leave. The hospital was almost totally self-sufficient at this time. By maintaining sewing rooms, vegetable and straw houses, raising their own food, pumping water from underground wells and streams, and making their own soap, the hospital was similar to a small city, requiring few resources from outside its grounds.
According to State Biennial Reports, several probable causes of mental illness were determined in the first cases admitted. Among the more unusual causes were indigestion, religious anxiety, disappointed love, intense study, and jealousy. Epilepsy and tuberculosis were the two most common causes. As psychiatry was virtually an unexplored field, primary emphasis was placed on the physical needs of the individuals and maintaining a system of order within the hospital. The majority of individuals at this time were aged 20 to 40, and ranged in occupation from broom makers to lawyers. Early methods of calming these individuals included the use of hydrotherapy (running cool water over individuals' wrists and ankles to reduce metabolic rate), sensory deprivation chairs (chairs with straps and a hood to be lowered over the individual's head, depriving the person of his senses), twirling chairs (devised to spin individuals in rapid circles in order to separate the ""humors"" of the brain), and needle cabinets (steel boxes in which individuals sat in while high pressure water was pumped directly onto their skin). Strain jackets and shackles were used to restrain individuals. All of these seemingly cruel tactics served the purpose of preventing individuals from causing physical harm to themselves or others during their psychotic episodes.
As technology advanced, these early strategies were abandoned and a more curative approach was adopted. The hospital developed a motto that required its employees to treat patients as friends and brothers as opposed to inferiors. According to Pinel, it was believed that ""goodness is the most effective of remedies, and justice the most impressive of authorities."" Any employee not abiding by this motto was released from duty.
In 1852, the idea that religious instinct survives the wreck of the intellect initiated the construction of the first chapel for individuals' use. Music played during religious services seemed beneficial to these individuals and served as a rudimentary form of what was later to become music therapy. In 1859, Dorothea Lynde Dix visited the hospital. Through her, the hospital received a large number of amusement items as well as cash donations. Dix was a pioneer in the movement to establish mental health facilities. She thought it unnecessary to keep mentally disturbed persons in jail because of their burden on society. She appealed to lawmakers to establish a facility for these individuals where they could receive proper care. A period of local disorder brought about by the Civil War forced the hospital to close in 1861, and a large number of individuals from the St. Louis area were returned home. The hospital building was used as a barracks to house Federal troops. Due to the sudden influx of these persons back into the St. Louis community, St. Louis County built an asylum in 1948 that became the St. Louis State Hospital. Fulton individuals were transported by steamboat to this new hospital.
The Fulton hospital reopened in 1863 with approximately 125 individuals. Two years later the first black individuals were admitted to the hospital and cared for on a separate ""colored"" ward. By the early 1870s individuals engaged in work as well as recreational amusements on the hospital grounds. These activities kept patients' minds and bodies active while increasing their self esteem. Eventually, these activities evolved into what is today called recreational and occupational therapy.
By the turn of the century, many changes had taken place within the hospital. In 1910, the patient census had passed the 1,000 mark. Over time, crowding produced expansion of facilities. The original building now included two new large wings on either side. Twenty-nine wards were established and a special unit was built to house the criminally insane. Elevators were installed in various areas to aid disabled patients and alleviate confinement to rooms. Other facilities in operation on hospital grounds included an infirmary, kitchen, bakery, chapel, and museum. Stephens Park provided a place for patient recreation. Technological advancements aided in the maintenance needs of the hospital. Marsh pumps were installed pumping 35,000 gallons of water per day throughout the institution. Dynamos were purchased providing electric lights, a telephone system was setup, and a fire brigade was organized to further ensure patient safety.
Treatment approaches in the mid-1900s advanced to keep up with the rapidly growing hospital. Electrotherapy, insulin and metrozol shock treatment, and prefrontal lobotomies were all performed with the more serious patients. Emphasis in treatment of patients began to shift from merely physical maintenance to encompass mental demands as well. Patients engaged in occupational and recreational therapy, lessening the need for restraining techniques. As the use of restraints declined, an ""open door"" system was implemented with individual clothes lockers to encourage cleanliness. Holidays and special activities were planned to boost morale. Patient interaction became further possible with the building of a canteen. Finally, patient classifications on wards were designed. Epileptics, dangerous patients, tubercular patients, and prisoners were all separated.
By the early 1930s, physical ailments of patients were treated on hospital grounds. Physicians, dentists, and pathologists were employed in this task. Unfortunately, due to the vast number of patients, the doctor-patient ratio was approximately 1 to 543. In 1934, programs to educate the community about the prevention and treatment of mental diseases evolved. The medical staff aided in the task by speaking on several topics such as ""modern treatment and methods of mental diseases"" and ""value of recreational therapy in mental hospitals."" A result of this community education was the development of a volunteer program. The volunteer program provided social interaction for the individuals, as well as a chance for lay people to see and understand firsthand the disease of mental illness. Its overwhelming success is still apparent today, as volunteer interaction remains an important part of an individual's treatment.
The maximum-security Biggs Building was completed in 1940. It housed eight wards, with a kitchen and dining room, hydrotherapy facility, and a hospital ward. Individuals admitted into the Biggs unit were those found not guilty by reason of insanity, criminal sexual psychopaths, those awaiting pre-trial evaluation, and individuals incompetent to stand trial. Today, the Biggs Building has been expanded to include a female forensic unit. Prior to its establishment, women were sent to prison for murder and other serious crimes, or were placed elsewhere in the mental health system.
On March 15, 1956, a disastrous fire destroyed the administration building and the two adjoining wings which housed nearly 250 individuals. Fortunately, no lives were lost; however, many patient and hospital records were destroyed. Students from Westminster College, along with Fulton, Jefferson City, Columbia, and Mexico fire fighters, attempted to salvage whatever possible. The cost for wrecking fire damaged buildings exceeded $1,014,000, and the hospital had to suspend admissions for a few months. Appropriations made afterward allowed for rebuilding as well as the addition of a Geriatrics unit.
In the last half of the 1960s, the Hearnes Unit was built for the purpose of treating children. The main goal of the unit was to simulate normal life and convert maladjusted children into normal citizens. Children were accepted on a limited basis, with the highest census being 170. This facility was the first juvenile treatment center of the Mental Health Division. The 1970s were a time of implementing innovative outpatient treatment programs for problems resulting from specific needs. The average caseload in the early '70s was around 1,199. Outpatient programs provided aid to those afflicted by mental retardation, personality disorders, social maladjustment, and many other neurotic problems. In 1975, approximately 5,300 individuals appeared on the rolls of the hospital. Of these, however, only about 1,180 were physically present. Some 1,000 elderly individuals were placed in nursing homes, where their care and supervision could be attended to. In addition, hospital-based and satellite community clinics served some 2,600 outpatients, and several hundred individuals were on convalescent leave status to determine their readiness to resume community living.
Near the close of the 1970s, Fulton State Hospital applied for Medicaid funding of Geriatric individuals. This was the first time Medicaid funds were used for a psychiatric facility in the Division of Mental Health. Throughout the 1980s, the primary diagnoses of individuals hospitalized at Fulton State Hospital were schizophrenia and manic-depression. A new emphasis was placed on the reintegration of recovering individuals into the social setting. Treatment was expanded to include individual and group therapy, drug therapy, vocational rehabilitation, physical and psychological testing, speech and hearing services, education, and employment-preparedness projects.[1]
Five years after former Gov. Jay Nixon won legislative approval for the $211 million project, the Missouri Department of Mental Health opened the new Nixon Forensic Center in early July 2019. The new building is shaped like a backward “S” with wide hallways, high ceilings and ample use of natural light. The 500,000-square-foot complex features 300 beds separated into 12 living groups of 25 each. Fulton State Hospital consists of treatment units for high and intermediate security patients (Nixon Forensic Center, 300 beds), individuals with developmental disabilities (Hearnes Forensic Center), and the Sexual Offender Rehabilitation and Treatment Services (SORTS) program (Guhleman Forensic Center).

The city of Marshall gave 288 acres of land for the institution which, until 1925, was known as the Missouri State Colony for Feeble-minded and Epileptic. The 69th General Assembly authorized the purchase of 82 additional acres. Through the more than half-century of its existence, the institution has expanded until it is now comprised of three units at Marshall, Carrollton and Higginsville. The 70th General Assembly in 1959 designated the three units as the Marshall State School and Hospital, the Carrollton State School and Hospital, and the Higginsville State School and Hospital, with all three units operating under one superintendent.

Missouri,Nevada State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Nevada_State_Hospital,1885,,1887,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,Morris Frederick Bell,State Hospital for the Insane No. 3  | Southwest Missouri Mental Health Center,"Nevada State Hospital was established in 1885; it was the third asylum in Missouri. The first building to be built was the distinctive Kirkbride main building. Over the years the building lost most of its distinctive features and ornamentation. Originally called Lunatic Asylum Number 3, the State Hospital's first building opened on October 17,
1889. The Second Empire style main building was the single largest public building in Missouri at the time of its construction. The asylum was physically self-sufficient from the beginning. Spread out across 520 acres, it had its own water supply, laundry facilities, power plant, and telephone systems, as well as gardens, a lake, greenhouses, a dairy, a hennery, and a hog farm, all of which aided in the production of food stuffs and provided occupational therapy for inmates. In addition to the main building, the complex
contained numerous support buildings, structures, and outbuildings, including an ice plant, power plant, cannery, fire engine house, carpenter shop, barns, and silos.
During the late 1930s, the Missouri State Hospital Number 3 facilities expanded with the construction of new buildings to address overcrowded conditions. Concurrent with the construction of the Infirmary Building for acute care patients, the state built a Clinic Building to the north of the Infirmary Building to house diagnostic intake facilities and donnitory and treatment space for non-acute/chronic care patients. Another new facility on the hospital grounds was an employee dormitory. These improvements marked the most significant physical growth of the institution in the twentieth century.
In 1973, the Missouri Division of Mental Health divided the institution into the Nevada State Hospital and the Nevada State School and Hospital. The Nevada State Hospital treated mentally ill patients, while the Nevada State School and Hospital became a treatment, training, and habilitation center for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled patients. The latter was renamed Nevada Habilitation Center in 1983.
By 1991 Nevada State Hospital closed and transitioned its operations to a Community Psychiatric Rehabilitation Program known as Southwest Missouri Mental Health Center. The center continued these operations until 1997 when it relocated to a new inpatient facility in ElDorado Springs, Missouri. In conjunction with this move, the facility received an official title change to Southwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center and currently continues services under this title. All that remains is the former Infirmary Building, now renovated as a retirement home.

Missouri,St. Joseph State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Joseph_State_Hospital,1872,1874,1874,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Mostly demolished),,"State Lunatic Asylum #2 | Missouri State Hospital for the Insane  | Northwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation (Current @ new campus) | Western Reception, Diagnostic & Correctional Center (Current @ old campus)","The story begins in 1872 when Missouri’s State Legislature approved $200,000 for the building of a Lunatic Asylum and St. Joseph citizens convinced the legislature to locate it just east of their city. Opening its doors on November 9, 1874, the hospital was called the State Hospital for the Insane No.2, or more familiarly named the Lunatic Asylum #2. Beginning with 25 patients, the first hospital superintendent described the institution as ""the noble work of reviving hope in the human heart and dispelling the portentous clouds that penetrate the intellects of minds diseased.” And so it was for the next 127 years.
In no time at all the hospital’s 275 beds filled when relatives could no longer handle the special needs of family members with mental illness. Soon, an additional 120 beds were added, then another 250, then more and more over the years, as the hopelessly mental ill poured through their doors. In the hospital’s early years, the asylum was a self-sufficient institution where the patients worked on a farm, raising crops and livestock, to provide food for the facility. Allegedly, the hospital needed only to purchase salt and sugar to supplement their food provisions.
The hospital continued to be referred to as the State Lunatic Asylum #2 until 1899, when it gained the name the St. Joseph State Hospital. By the early 1950s, the facility had grown to nearly 3,000 beds and housed some of the most criminally insane individuals in the state, as well as those that could be rehabilitated, and others who were merely depressed. According to the museum, a few of these patients were just mildly depressed individuals who were dumped there by annoyed relatives. With modern medications, more and more patients began to return to society. Throughout its history, the hospital underwent a series of experimental treatments for its patients, some of which sound more like a cause rather than a cure for insanity.
In 1967, a museum was started in a ward of the St. Joseph State Hospital by a man named George Glore, a lifetime employee of the Missouri Department of Mental Health. Beginning with several full-sized replicas of 16th, 17th and 18th century treatment devices that were created for a mental health awareness exhibit, he soon began to look for other items that would illustrate how the treatment of mental illness had progressed over the years. George Glore spent the larger part of his 41 year career with the Missouri Department of Mental Health in developing the largest collection of exhibits featuring the evolution of mental health care in the United States. Glore retired from government service in the 1990s.
By the early 1990’s the majority of the patients of the asylum had been released back into society with the help of modern medications. In August, 1994, the state of Missouri approved a bond that allowed for the large asylum campus and hospital to be converted into a correctional facility. By July, 1997 a new state-of-the-art building was completed across the street from the original campus and the new Northwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation opened with 108 beds.
It was also in 1997 that Glore’s Psychiatric Museum was forced to move from the campus and soon relocated to a 1968 building that once served as a clinic for patients at the mental hospital, which now sits right outside the prison fence. The Western Reception Diagnostic and Correctional Center opened on the old asylum campus in 1999, now confining over 1,800 inmates.[1]

In 1997, a new mental hospital, the Northwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center was built across the street from the original hospital campus.  The Glore Psychiatric Museum, which had approximately 3,300 items, was moved into a building that had been constructed in 1968 as the medical, surgical, and admitting building for the mental hospital.

Designed and built by architect William Rumbold, it is the second governmental facility in the state to serve this population. Rumbold also designed the dome on the Old Courthouse, site of the famous Dred Scott trials and now part of the Gateway Arch National Park. (It is believed he went on to consult on the design of the dome on the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.) The building's bricks were made on site and cost overruns made it the most expensive facility of its kind west of the Mississippi, $750,000 in a time when annual income was $150-$200.
In 1876 the City of St. Louis separates from St. Louis County, so the facility name changes to ""The St. Louis City Insane Asylum"". Thirty-five years later, it was renamed ""City Sanitarium"". Regarded as a showpiece, a model of the western world's ability to take care of its more vulnerable, the Dome Building became a ""must see"" for foreign dignitaries and tourists. The elevation of its city view made it the premier lookout point prior to the 630 ft. Gateway Arch. Graffiti inside the dome attests to its many visitors. Periodically, civic and social leaders dressed up to dance with patients in the ballroom below the dome. Later, debutante parties were common in the Dome Building lobby.
By 1907, construction on wings and annexes (known as buildings B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J, and separate K building) to the original building commences to accommodate the 2000 patients and 300 staff members. More and more people are admitted to the hospital because roads and transportation improved. The next overflow crisis occurred in the early 1920s which precipitated a separate building being erected for attendants' quarters.  This freed space in the hospital into which patients could be moved. By 1940, the hospital had 3,844 patients.
Dr. Louis Kohler took over the hospital when was 120 percent overcrowded.  He established an out-patient clinic and a three-year residency program for psychiatrists.  On October 22, 1962,  the Louis H. Kohler Building was erected.  It included 4 floors with wings on each side. In 1968, a contract was awarded to add two additional floors on the Kohler Building, which would make the building six floors.
In October 1997, St. Louis State Hospital moved into its new quarters at 5300 Arsenal. To reflect the new philosophy of treating psychiatric illness, the facility was renamed to St. Louis Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center.  This new psychiatric and rehabilitation facility is constructed to accommodate 212 clients, housed in a series of 14 cottages and 4 wards. The West wing annex (buildings B, C, D, and E) of the original Dome Building and the Kohler Building were demolished. This demolition accomplished two goals, the first being the removal of the Kohler Building which blocked the view of the historical Dome Building. And secondly, leveling the remaining West wing returned the Dome's structure to Rumbold's original design.

Southwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center was formerly known as Nevada State Hospital. Nevada State Hospital No. 3 admitted its first client in 1887 and once operated its own School of Nursing. The hospital continued as an inpatient psychiatric facility for 104 years.
In 1991 Nevada State Hospital closed and transitioned its operations to a Community Psychiatric Rehabilitation Program known as Southwest Missouri Mental Health Center. The center continued these operations until 1997 when it relocated to a new inpatient facility in El Dorado Springs Missouri. In conjunction with this move, the facility received an official title change to Southwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center and currently continues services under this title.
Southwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center now operates a 4 bed Medicare certified Distinct Part Hospital devoted to acute care and a 12 bed Psychosocial Rehabilitation Program.

Missouri,Western Missouri Mental Health Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Western_Missouri_Mental_Health_Center,,,1954,Active,Single Building,,Psychiatric Receiving Center | Center for Behavioral Medicine (Current),"The history of CBM/WMMHC dates back to 1954 when the greater Kansas City Mental Health Foundation opened the Psychiatric Receiving Center.  The PRC was the first racially integrated psychiatric facility in Kansas City.  Its purpose was to provide mental health services to indigent Kansas City residents in their community.  Serving as the psychiatric section of the city’s General Hospital system, the PRC was one of the pioneers in community mental health using the new psychotropic drugs and treatment therapies.  It was the recipient of the Gold Medal Award of the American Psychiatric Association. Its two inpatient wards, an admissions unit and a discharge unit, emphasized community oriented treatment and its outpatient program maintained patients while they continued to function in their community.
In May of 1963, the Kansas City General Hospital and Medical Center took over the administration of the PRC with the foundation remaining in an advisory role and moving into new areas of mental health research and programming.
In 1963, the Missouri Legislature upgraded the State’s psychiatric services by authorizing the Division of Mental Diseases (Now the Department of Mental Health) to develop three intensive treatment centers across the state.  In addition to WM in Kansas City, Malcolm Bliss Mental Health Center in St. Louis and Mid-Missouri Mental Health Center in Columbia were set up to work with established programs in their respective areas.
General Hospital #2, formerly for African American patients, was purchased from the city, remodeled and enlarged.  Directly adjacent to the PRC WM opened on March 11, 1966, and the two facilities worked together to continue and expand services to the indigent and extended these services to the residents of the 31 western counties of Missouri.  A total assimilation of the Psychiatric Receiving Center by DMH was March 1, 1970.
The Center also maintains close relationships with a wide array of community agencies that assist persons suffering from mental illness or other psychiatric conditions.
The new facility was designed to replace the existing Western Missouri Mental Health Center, encompassing the Center, East, West, South and Old KC Regional Annex Buildings, all of which has been negatively impacted by the proposed widening of 22nd Street in Kansas City. The new construction allowed for an integrated facility, and provides easy access and parking. It is occupied primarily by the Division of Comprehensive Psychiatric Services, with some space allotted to the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse. There was originally a total of 115 beds, including 12 beds in Emergency Services and 15 beds to serve the adolescent population.
This new (approximately 230,000 sf) multi-story acute care psychiatric hospital building comprises five wards with private courtyards, outdoor recreation areas, a combination gymnasium/multi-purpose room, a full service kitchen and dining room, a main ""mall"" or circulation corridor with access to patient occupational activity areas, a library, and the hospital clinic. The building was originally designed to house a forensic unit and a methadone clinic, each strategically isolated from one another and the main facility.

They had 2 separate facilities at different locations, both using the same name however.
In 1892, the Deutsche Evangelische Synode von Nord-Amerika (German Evangelical Synod of North America) voted to set aside its former seminary property as a home for epileptics to be called the Emmaus Asyl für Epileptiker und Idioten (Emmaus Asylum for Epileptics and Idiots) for persons with mental retardation and epilepsy. Pastor Carl Schnake became the first superintendent of the home when it opened on July 4, 1893. The first resident arrived on July 5th, coming from New Orleans. Emmaus was the first institution of its kind west of the Mississippi.
In the 1900 book by William Pryor Letchworth entitled Care and Treatment of Epileptics, the author describes the Emmaus Asylum near Marthasville, Missouri. 
The charity was organized by Rev. C. Schnake. Two buildings of stone, spacious, well lighted, and well ventilated, afford accommodations for fifty patients, and, together with the residence of the Superintendent and a small chapel, comprise the buildings of the colony. The estate contains 240 acres, the greater part of which has not been cleared and fitted for field use.
The Emmaus Asylum for Epileptics and Idiots was also known as the Emmaus Asylum for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded, and later was called the Emmaus Home for Epileptics and the Mentally Retarded. As society came to better understand developmental disabilities and the contributions people with disabilities could make to the community, Emmaus’ programs changed and grew. While some individuals still reside on the Emmaus campuses, many now live in homes in the community. Today, Emmaus serves clients in nearly 50 homes throughout the St. Charles, St. Louis, Warren and Franklin counties and St. Louis City. Emmaus works with each client to help them live as independently as possible.
This separate campus was opened in 1901 and for female patients only. The original hospital buildings there have been demolished.",,"Marthasville & St. Charles, MO",,

Missouri,Ralph Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ralph_Sanitarium,,,1900,Demolished,Single Building,,,"An article from the Kansas City Medical Record, Volume 26, Issue 3, originally published March of 1909 describes the available treatments at the facility;
The method of treatment is new and very successful. The withdrawal of the drug is not attended by any suffering and the cure is complete in a few weeks time, the Kansas City Medical Record stated. The treatment is varied according to the requirements of each individual case and the restoration to normal condition is hastened by the use of electricity, massage electric light baths, hot and cold tub and shower baths, vibratory massage, and a liberal, well cooked digestible diet. A modern, carefully conducted home sanitarium with spacious surroundings and attractive drives and walks. Electro and Hydrotherapeutic advantages are unexcelled. Trained nurses, hot water heat, electric lights. Special rates to physicians for reprints from medical journals and full details of treatment. Dr. Benjamin Burroughs Ralph, 529 Highland, Kansas City MO.
According to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, on Oct. 1, 1903, a fire at the facility killed one patient and badly injured five others. Damage was estimated at $4,000 according to published reports of the day. The facility was demolished in 1983 and the carriage house was demolished in 1994 to make way for surface parking and another classroom building at the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences.",1965,"Kansas City, MO",,
Missouri,Robinson's Neurological Clinic,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Robinson%27s_Neurological_Clinic,,,1914/1935,Preserved,Single Building,Henry Hoit,Christian Church Hospital | Base Hospital No. 28 | Punton Sanitarium | Robinson Neurological Hospital | Robinson Memorial Hospital,"At one of the high points of the city, 27th and Paseo, the Christian Church Hospital, constructed of pale yellow brick and stone with massive stone columns above the entrance, opened its doors to the public in April, 1916. It is the last word in hospital architecture; not a detail has been overlooked, said a news story of the day. The $330,000 building had 75 rooms and 150 beds. Speakers at the dedication ceremonies April 9, 1916, were R. A. Long, Dr. George H. Combs, Dr. L. J. Marhall and Dr. Jabez N. Jackson. J. W. Perry was president of the hospital association.
Long, multimillionaire, devoted churchman and philanthropist, had given $200,000 toward building the hospital, and $156,000 was contributed by church members to an endowment fund, the income to insure that one-third of the beds would be used by charity patients, a stipulation in the Long gift. Five years before the hospital was built, Long's plans were more ambitious. He had hoped to make Kansas City the national center of the Christian Church, and toward this end he purchased a 38-acre tract bounded by 17th, 20th, Hardesty and Brighton, at a cost of $95,000. H. F. Hoit, architect, drew elaborate plans for more than a score of church buildings. Church offices and publications, as well as a hospital, were planned.
In the 1920s financial difficulties faced the church-operated hospital and in 1926 an offer was accepted from the veterans' bureau to lease the property for $34,000 a year, as an official Veterans Hospital, housing disabled World War I veterans. Dr. E. J. Rose was installed as medical officer.
Dr. Robert Patterson, a renowned psychiatrist, bought it in 1927 after the U.S. government lease expired. This European-trained doctor used questionable methods to treat patients. In those days, advanced psychiatry included chains, wet sheets, cages, and, according to some legends, the ice pick technique of frontal lobotomies. Doctor Patterson continued using these controversial methods for three decades. In the late 50s, he suddenly developed mental health issues himself, shortly after the hospital closed. The city eventually purchased the hospital and converted it to a facility to hold the criminally insane. In 1975, the city decided it did not want to keep paying for the upkeep of the building, and moved out of it.
It was left vacant for more than three decades until Hoffman Cortes Restoration, a local group, transformed it into The Residences of West Paseo. During the renovation, all the terra-cotta features and exterior masonry were restored. The casement security windows, which were installed in the 1930s, were removed and replaced with reproductions. The waiting rooms and entrance lobby on the second floor have been renovated with new marble walls. Overall, the financing sources of the project cost $11.5 million. In 2007, The Residences of West Paseo won the Preservation Award from the Historic City Foundation.",1975,"Kansas City, MO",Classic Revival,
Missouri,St Vincent's Institution,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St_Vincent%27s_Institution,,1891-1893? (Kirkbride),"August 1858 (Original hospital), 1895 (Kirkbride)",Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Geo. R. Mann,Insane Asylum of the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul  | St Vincent's Hospital,"This institution was founded as a private hospital for care of those with mental diseases and administered by the Sisters of Charity of Vincent de Saint Paul. Originally this order ran the Mullanphy Hospital in St. Lewis and realizing the increasing number of patients afflicted with mental diseases. Due to the detrimental effect of the mentally ill on other patients a separate facility for their care was sought. A home was soon secured for their use at Ninth and Marion Streets in St. Louis, which in August of 1858 was occupied by four sisters and 15 patients. The patient population swelled as state institutions closed as a result of the Civil War but returned to more normal levels following its closing. By the 1870s this institution was regarded as  ""one  of  the  most  renowned  in  the  west.""
Plans to move the hospital out of the city were considered as early as 1863. In 1891 97 acres of land were purchased on St. Charles Rock rd in St. Louis County one mile beyond city limits from Charles  Lucas  Hunt. Under the supervision of Sister M. Magdalene, Superior plans were quickly drawn up for the new building following the Kirkbride Plan. In the fall of 1895 the building was completed and the sisters and patients moved in. This proved to be fortunate as the following May the building formerly occupied by the hospital was destroyed by the St. Louis Cyclone of 1896.
The new building proved ideal for treatment of the insane, located on a hill in beautiful countryside well away from the city. It could accommodate 500 patients, with each ward under the charge of the Sisters of Charity. The brick building was built on the modified kirkbride plan, consisting of a central administration flanked on either side by two wings. To the rear of the administration were the supporting buildings and chapel. It was four stories tall along with a basement story. The building itself was built in the Châteauesque style and to this day retains its many tall spire and turrets. When it opened it has an area of over 200,000 square feet; over 400 rooms, and could care for over 500 patients.
Since opening a gymnasium as well as an entertainment hall were erected for the benefits of the patients. An addition to the southern wing, the Laboure Clinic for the acutely ill, was opened in 1958. The hospital remarkably managed to keep pace with the times in terms of treatment while maintaining its original building and character.
The as of 1916 the hospital was treating 500-600 patients a year with an average of over 300 in treatment at one time. The hospital boasted a 25% cured rate with a 60% improved rate for all cases at this time. The 1930 census lists the patient population as 343.  By 1941 the hospital was involved in the treatment of those with mental and nervous disorders as well as selected cases of alcoholism and drug addiction. The hospital remained in operation until 1978 when it was consolidated with the DePaul Community Health Center in Bridgeton, and the building was vacated.
About 132.66 acres of the grounds and the adjacent Marillac College property were sold to St. Louis County for use as a park, while the remaining 21.11 acres, in 
cluding the building were leased to private developers. The hospital building was renovated into housing and now is called the Castle Park Apartments.

The city of Marshall gave 288 acres of land for the institution which, until 1925, was known as the Missouri State Colony for Feeble-minded and Epileptic. The 69th General Assembly authorized the purchase of 82 additional acres. Through the more than half-century of its existence, the institution has expanded until it is now comprised of three units at Marshall, Carrollton and Higginsville. The 70th General Assembly in 1959 designated the three units as the Marshall State School and Hospital, the Carrollton State School and Hospital, and the Higginsville State School and Hospital, with all three units operating under one superintendent.

Over the years the school offered educational, vocational, and recreational opportunities supplemented by social service, psychology, medical attention and religious opportunities. The oldest building on the institution is reported to be the supply commissary built in 1888. As additional boys were committed more housing was required and in 1894 the present Stone Cottage, current Administration Building, was completed followed by Stephens Cottage, current visiting room, in 1896 named after Governor Lon V. Stephens, our Missouri governor at the time the institution opened in 1889. An additional 169 acres of land was purchased in 1898 and from the profits of the brickyard an additional 8 acres was acquired bringing the total to 345 acres.
In 1933, another reformatory school for boys, known as Algoa Farms, was opened and the name of the Missouri Reformatory again became the Missouri Training School for Boys. At this time the maximum enrollment was 646. Since the admission age to Algoa was between seventeen and twenty-five, the interpretation of the statutes for admission to the training school in Boonville was below seventeen years of age. By 1938 the Missouri Reform School for Boys at Boonville, which held as many as 650 youth at a time, was labeled one of the worst juvenile correctional institutions in the nation. In 1969 a federal report condemned Boonville as severely substandard in its efforts to rehabilitate and educate youth.
The school which had been operating as a penal institution for juveniles came under the direction of the State Board of Training Schools on March 17, 1948. From 1938 to 1949 there was little or no new construction or remodeling work done. World War II virtually stopped all work for the duration of the war. In 1949 the power plant was renovated and in 1950 Barton, Daniel Boone, George Washington Carver, Mark Twain, and George Caleb Bingham cottages were completed. A presidential commission encouraged states to create “cottage life” for institutionalized children during this period so life at the institution simulated a family.
In 1970, vocational training included five accredited areas: auto mechanics, woodworking, metal, print shop, and radio/electronics. Title 1 programs funded in 1968 included typing, driver’s education, GED, music appreciation and photography. In the 1970’s reform for youth took a definite turn and the larger “penal” juvenile facilities became a way of the past. Juveniles were placed in smaller group homes to simulate family and if possible be closer to their families and the last largest juvenile facility in the state, Boonville Training School for Boys, was closed in 1983. In 1983 the DOC constructed a 14-foot chain link fence topped with razor wire encompassing the main grounds of the 59 acre facility.

Missouri,United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=United_States_Medical_Center_for_Federal_Prisoners,1930,,1933,Active,Pavilion Plan,,MCFP Springfield,"The Medical Center was built at 1900 West Sunshine Street, the corner of Wabash and Sunshine. During the Great Depression, the people of Springfield gave 620 acres of land to the federal government to build the hospital. Congress acted to create the Medical Center in 1930. The first buildings were completed in 1933. The unoccupied land was originally used by the prisoners for farming. In 1966 this farming was abandoned. In 1977 the federal government returned some of the original 620 acres to Springfield.
The hospital was created to care for the physical and mental disorders of federal prisoners in prisons all over the country. There are over 90 of these prisons now. Patients range from minimum-security to maximum-security inmates. Patients are transported from their home institution to the Medical Center by automobiles, institutional buses and airplanes. Every two weeks a 94-passenger airplane starts at the west coast and jumps all the way to the east coast making many stops to pick up and drop off passengers across the United States. If a patient has an acute condition he is either brought to the Medical Center by chartered plane or is treated in a local hospital. All chronic problems are treated at the Medical Center.
The Medical Center is staffed by over 500 full-time employees. These include correctional officers and medical personnel such as doctors, nurses, dentists, psychologists and surgeons. The Medical Center is one of Springfield's major industries. There are no women federal prisoners housed at the Medical Center. They are treated by local hospitals wherever they are inmates. The first superintendent of the Medical Center was Dr. Marion R. King. Some other notable superintendents were Pat Keohane, who was a native of Springfield and ran the prison from 1995 to 1999, and Pat Ciccone who ran the Medical Center from 1965 to 1978.
MCFP had three riots during its existence, in 1941, 1944 and 1959. All three riots were brought under control with tear gas. The 1959 rioters captured five hostages. It was the only riot with any casualties. One prisoner was killed as an assault force rescued the hostages. One hostage was also slightly injured.
Many famous people have spent time in the Medical Center. Among them are John Gotti, Robert Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz), and Larry Flynt who apparently liked Springfield so much he considered buying the Elfindale Manor in which to live and perhaps start a magazine. The convicted terrorist Omar Abdel Rahman, also called the ""blind sheik,"" also spent time at the Medical Center.",,"Springfield, MO",,

Missouri,Cass County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cass_County_Poor_Farm,,,,Demolished,Single Building,,Cass County Home,"The Cass County Poor Farm (later referred to as the County Home) housed the county’s paupers, often those who were old, feeble, and disabled. Many inhabitants were also “pay patients,” individuals were elderly and ill whose families had paid for them to stay there during the duration of their illness. Those who were able bodied worked as laborers on the farm and several of the inhabitants spent most of their lives there. This register begins in 1901 when the poor farm was located on roughly 120 acres in the northeast corner of Dolan Township. The County Home later relocated in the spring of 1910 to just north of Harrisonville. The building constructed specifically to be used as the County Home is still standing and in use as part of the Golden Years Health Center complex on Jefferson Parkway. It remained in operation at that location until its closure in 1945.
When the County Home was located in Dolan Township, those who died while in the county’s care were buried in a cemetery on the grounds. County records of those deaths and burials no longer exist, if they ever existed at all. However, with the use of the Poor Farm Register, death certificates, cemetery records, and additional research, the county was able to “recreate” death and cemetery records for inhabitants who died while living at the County Home or immediately after leaving it from 1910-1953.",1945,"Harrisonville, MO",,

Missouri,"Greene County Almshouse, MO","https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Greene_County_Almshouse,_MO",,,1855,Demolished,Single Building,,Greene County Poor House | Sunshine Acres Nursing Home,"In 1855 Greene County established its first almshouse, or poorhouse, about 10 miles west of the location of the final almshouse and the current Almshouse Cemetery and Memorial Park. By 1873 Land was purchased just east of what was then Springfield’s eastern city limits, near Pickwick Avenue. There, a “substantial brick building” was erected and used as an almshouse. The city had grown to include the location of the almshouse, and the property had increased in value. Also, the increasing number of residents had rendered the old building too small for their accommodation. The decision was made to build a new almshouse on property west of town on Division Street in 1890.
The News and Leader newspaper published a story with photos in 1937 that exposed the terrible conditions at the almshouse. The report refers to the almshouse as a “tumble-down, overcrowded, filthy firetrap which serves Greene County as an almshouse — where 135 men and women daily risk their lives by merely living.…” It also says Works Progress Administration (WPA) officials had approved plans to build a new almshouse the next year. The dilapidated buildings were razed to make way for a new almshouse the following year. A new and final almshouse was built in 1939. Over the years, it became known as Sunshine Acres to many in Greene County and was eventually named Sunshine Acres Nursing Home.
Sunshine Acres was shut down by the state health department which cited the facility for sanitation issues and building deficiencies. 1978 and the land was sold to the Springfield Regional Airport with Greene County retaining the cemetery property in 1979.",,"Springfield, MO",,

Missouri,Missouri State Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Missouri_State_Sanatorium,,,1907,Active,Cottage Plan,,Missouri Rehabilitation Center | University of Missouri Health Care (Current),"Missouri Rehabilitation Center was originally established as the Missouri State Sanatorium in 1907 to treat tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB), also known as the ""White Plague,"" was a major health problem. A diagnosis of tuberculosis often meant impending death and the only known treatment for it was fresh air, sunshine, nutrition and bed rest. To keep the disease from spreading, patients were isolated from society. Thus the Missouri Legislature appropriated $50,000 to establish a sanatorium.
A board of five people was appointed to build a brick or stone facility, capable of future enlargement, at a site at least 1,000 feet above sea level. Chigger Hill in Mt. Vernon met all the requirements. The site had available water, an abundance of shade trees, and was adaptable to support agricultural and dairy needs. To secure its selection, the city offered the state approximately 60 acres of land, a cash donation of $3,000. The city agreed to furnish water, electricity and telephone service for the first five years. The first building, Gupton Villa, was erected at a cost of $20,000. The first patient was admitted Aug. 17, 1907.
The plan called for a total of 12 buildings to be grouped in the form of a Maltese cross, eight of the buildings were to house patients with the remaining ones to be used for administration and support services. Diagnosis of tuberculosis took six to eight weeks and because there were no medications to treat the disease, patients confined to the sanatorium spent months or years away from home. Reinfection was common and often necessitated a return to the hospital.
Drugs were developed in the 1950's that effectively controlled tuberculosis. Patients were able to go home sooner and were usually able to be treated in their local communities. Since that time, drug therapy and diagnostic techniques have become even more efficient. Diagnosis has been shortened from six weeks to as little as a few days. This meant the census of the hospital began to decline. Fewer people had to come to Mt. Vernon for treatment and those who did went home sooner. The old system of housing patients in eight different locations changed. By 1970, the six-story Hearnes building had been erected to bring all patients under one roof. All but one of the original patient buildings was subsequently demolished.
Coinciding with the decline in tuberculosis came an increase in other lung diseases, brought on by a larger population and a greater acceptance of and increase in smoking. The Missouri Sanatorium, with its emphasis on care of lung patients, was the logical place for establishing a facility for the treatment of chest diseases.
In 1971, the Missouri General Assembly expanded the mission of the institution to include all types of cardiac and pulmonary problems, including emphysema, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, COPD and others. The name was changed to Missouri State Chest Hospital. Again, modern medicine shortened the length of stay needed to care for these diseases.
Re-admissions were reduced through the implementation of a respiratory rehabilitation program which taught patients to care for themselves at home. Patients learned to recognize problems before they developed into a crisis. The hospital was able to send patients home who would have been destined to remain in the hospital for the rest of their lives because of ventilator dependence. A significant number of patients were weaned from the ventilator, even though they had been deemed unweanable by other institutions; many had been on ventilators for a long time.
In cases where weaning was not practical, families were trained in the care of their loved ones in order to go home for short periods of time or be discharged altogether. These factors, and new regulations put into effect by medicare, Medicaid and private insurances, brought about a decline in census similar to the decline experienced by other hospitals throughout the nation. In order to make use of its space, the hospital opened an outpatient clinic and an inpatient hospice program.
In 1983 the Mount Vernon Veterans Home was established in a three-story wing of Brasher Building of the Missouri State Chest Hospital.  The Veterans Home was created to provide 24-hour nursing care for veterans whose medical problems include Alzheimer’s disease and service-related lung problems. (Source:  ""Two Area Veterans are Home's First Residents"", Springfield News-Leader May 13, 1983).
The Missouri General Assembly again changed the facility's name and mission. This time, it would answer the needs of those who were seriously impaired through accident or injury and who had capacity for improvement through extensive rehabilitation. General physical rehabilitation was begun in late 1985 and the center opened its traumatic brain injury (TBI) program in January, 1986. The program has grown to be the largest in the state. Several components were added including a transitional living unit, a behavior modification unit and a program for comprehensive substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation program (CSTAR). An outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program was opened in 1989. In 1990, the center rented space to the Veterans Administration for an outpatient clinic to be operated as a satellite of the VA Hospital in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The clinic contracts with the Missouri Rehabilitation Center to provide services which included laboratory, radiology, maintenance and housekeeping.
In 1996, the Missouri General Assembly transferred ownership of Missouri Rehabilitation Center to the University of Missouri Health Care. The merger with the University of Missouri Health Care was necessitated by a competitive HMO-dominated health care market. Missouri Rehabilitation Center has benefited significantly from their affiliation with the University of Missouri. MRC is now a center of excellence, offering the finest health care available. Through the use of technology, telemedicine, research and education, the citizens of missouri are the direct beneficiaries of this growth. Physicians now have the ability to provide live medical consultations via interactive television -- without transferring the patient from the hospital.
A new state-of-the-art Intensive Care Unit was opened in the summer of 2001. The new ICU has two distinct benefits. It provides expanded space that will allow the Center to accept more acute rehabilitation patients, and it allows medical staff to start rehabilitation efforts sooner.

Missouri,Robert Koch Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Robert_Koch_Hospital,,,1875,Demolished,Cottage Plan,"Barnett, Haynes, and Barnett",Koch Tubercular Hospital,"The Robert Koch Hospital was located just off US 255 before it crosses the Jefferson Barracks Bridge in south county at 4101 Koch Road. The hospital was built by the city of St. Louis primarily as a quarantine facility for patients with a variety of easily transmissible diseases, including smallpox, yellow fever, and tuberculosis. There is a cemetery located on the grounds of this closed hospital, the building founded in 1875. The city expanded the site to include Quarantine Hospital, to quarantine and treat patients suffering from cholera, yellow fever and smallpox.
In 1910, it received the name Robert Koch Hospital, and its focus turned to tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. The dreaded tuberculosis, popularly known as TB, killed more residents than all other infectious diseases combined. The hospital provided free medical care to victims of the disease. The hospital at its peak had 19 buildings, its own post office, and even its own town, Koch, Missouri. The 19 buildings that survived to 1989 were all built between 1907 and 1939. It consisted of a 426-bed intermediate care facility, a 39-bed hospital, and a 166-bed residential-care facility.
The hospital expanded in 1920, 1933 and 1934 but still couldn’t keep up with demand. In 1939 the city made plans to expand the hospital to 1,000 beds to eliminate the waiting list, but couldn’t secure an appropriation from Congress to fund it. By the government’s own standards, the appropriate sizing for the hospital would have been 1,200 beds, due the the average number of deaths in the St. Louis area topping 600 at the time. Once cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever were no longer raging out of control in the city, Koch Hospital saw a second career treating tuberculosis.
The buildings that made up Robert Koch Hospital in St. Louis were generally a combination of Italian Romanesque and Italian Renaissance. Hospital design in the early 20th century needed to provide an attractive and appealing facade and landscape to convey a sense of hope, while retaining flexibility due to rapidly changing medical practices. After World War II, new drugs, including antibiotics, revolutionized the treatment of most infectious diseases.  The hospital that was far too small in 1939 was bigger than it needed to be by the 1950s.
The city considered selling the hospital, then decided to repurpose it. It served as a type of nursing home from 1961 until November 1983, when it closed for good, and the city sold the perimeter acreage. In 1985, the city sold the remaining buildings to Bussen Quarries. The new owners demolished the buildings in 1989.",1983,"Oakville, MO",,
