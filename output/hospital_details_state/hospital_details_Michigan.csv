Michigan,Ann Arbor State Psychopathic Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ann_Arbor_State_Psychopathic_Hospital,,,1906,Active,Single Building,,State Psychopathic Hospital,"In the late 1890s, U-M Professor of Nervous Diseases and Electrotherapeutics William J. Herdman (M.D. 1875) set the wheels in motion to build, at the University, a psychopathic hospital for the care and study of mental illness. In 1901 the Michigan state legislature allocated the funding for the facility, and in 1906 the State Psychopathic Hospital opened its doors. The hospital was among the first of its kind in the nation — one intended to provide diagnosis and research on mental diseases rather than custodial care. It contained state-of-the-art research equipment, including a laboratory in which psychiatrists trained in pathological examination studied brain tissue sent from hospitals all over Michigan.
Albert M. Barrett, M.D., the hospital’s first director, oversaw both psychiatry and neurology within what was originally called the Department of Nervous and Mental Diseases until 1920, then continued as chair of the newly formed Department of Psychiatry until his death in 1936.
Shortly after the hospital’s opening, an article in a University publication stated, “For the treatment of the nervous system, the hospital is furnished with apparatus for generating all kinds of electric current. Attendants especially skilled in the application of electricity and massage are put in charge of these cases.”
Michigan’s groundbreaking experiment — looking at mental illness through a lens of scientific scrutiny coupled with humane compassion — was proving successful; by the 1930s, the need for more beds, more physicians trained in psychiatry and more opportunities for residents interested in the field made expansion a priority. The Neuropsychiatric Institute was opened in 1939, adjacent to the University of Michigan Hospital (Old Main), a proximity which signaled a new relationship between medicine and psychiatry. New director Raymond Waggoner (M.D. 1924) immediately set up a three-room psychiatric consultation unit — one of the first such units in a general hospital in the country. Institute faculty and staff fostered increasing ties with medical departments through consultation and outpatient clinics.
Throughout his long tenure (1937-70), Waggoner embodied much of the change that was taking place in the treatment of the mentally ill. Originally trained as a neurologist, he embraced both psychoanalysis and biological theories in psychiatry. His openness to new ideas and his willingness to see each patient as a total person with emotional and physical forces at play helped to forge the bio psychosocial model that is the foundation of psychiatry today.
Since taking the helm of the department in 1985, John Greden, M.D., has worked tirelessly to integrate and translate neuroscience and behavioral science advances, and to battle stigmas that, even today, keep people from seeking help. His work in depression, for example, has brought Michigan national recognition — and given hope to hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from this disease. The new University of Michigan Depression Center is a place where behavioral scientists, neuroscientists, clinical investigators and multidisciplinary leaders from other schools and departments across campus, such as Nursing, Public Health, Pharmacy, Social Work and Psychology, come together to share information, collaborate on research, and offer patients the most up-to-date and comprehensive treatments available.
A century ago, in a simple brick and wood edifice that cost $50,000 to build, several U-M faculty members and nurses strived to care for an unending stream of desperate patients while knowing virtually nothing about what caused psychiatric disorders, and with no way to evaluate underlying brain functions. Today, several hundred U-M faculty and hundreds of nurses, social workers, therapists, and trainees of all kinds make powerful, tangible differences in the lives of thousands of patients in the Department of Psychiatry and the Depression Center in the recently-opened Rachel Upjohn Building.",,"Ann Arbor, MI",,
Michigan,Caro State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Caro_State_Hospital,1913,,1914,Active,Cottage Plan,,Michigan Farm Colony for Epileptics at Wahjamega | Wahjamega Farm Colony for Epileptics | Caro State Hospital for Epileptics | Caro State Home & Training School | Caro Regional Mental Health Center  | Caro Psychiatric Hospital,"In the spring of 1913 Judge Henry S Hulbert and Tracy W McGregor, members of an organization of Detroit businessmen called the Thursday Noon Group, helped to lead a campaign aimed at social reform of the Detroit area prison and mental health programs of the time.  The work of this organization culminated in the creation and passage of the 1921 Act 392 of the public acts, which provided that the state should have the power to ""care, custody, and maintenance of feeble-minded persons within such county"".[1]
Prior to the passage of this act Hulbert, McGregor, and Fred M. Butzel began to focus on juvenile delinquents, the mentally ill, and persons who were diagnosed with the newly assigned medical condition of Epilepsy.  All three men felt that improper care was being given to some of these people, and that segregated institutions that provided more treatment specific care for each persons disorder were more essential to treatment and as such a facility devoted to the treatment of epilepsy was established in 1914 in Wahjamega, a small unincorporated community in the Township of Indianfields, Michigan[2]. Much of the original population of the facility was moved from the then overcrowded Lapeer State Home for Epileptics.  By 1928 funding shortfalls had lead to overcrowding here too, and the governor pushed for an expansion of services, which resulted in the state passing a 120 million dollar expansion bill in 1930-32.
This facility gained some fame later on as it was one of several facilities that was involved in forced sterilizations that took place under Michigan laws from 1914 to the mid 1960's[3].  The facility has operated under several names over the years and is currently still in operation as the Caro Regional Mental Health Center. In October 2019, lawmakers authorized construction of a $63 million, 100-bed state psychiatric hospital to replace the current Caro Regional Mental Health Center on the Caro site. There was a groundbreaking in 2017 to build a $115 million, 200-bed, 225,000-square foot hospital; but just as construction was to start, Gov. Whitmer, and Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon halted the project and hired a consulting firm to review it.
In 2023 a new 130,000-square-foot, 100-bed center opened to will help provide access to physical and mental health resources in mid-Michigan.The new state-of-the-art hospital offers four separate patient neighborhoods/units, each decorated with therapeutic colors reflecting seasonal color schemes for each respective season. Rooms are mostly single-bed suites with private bedrooms for geriatric patients. There are also spaces for patients offering a hair-care salon, exercise room, greenhouse and recreation room. The facility includes an updated HVAC system, modernized spaces for treatment consultations, staff meetings and breakroom spaces.",,"Caro, MI",,

At present, Hawthorn Center has capacity for 118 patients. An agency of the Michigan Department of Community Health, Hawthorn Center has been one of the Midwest's finest psychiatric treatment facilities for children for over forty years. More than 30,000 children and their families have received services since the hospital opened in 1956.
A new hospital is being made possible by a $325 million FY23 budget allocation by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the legislature. It will care for patients currently served at both Hawthorn Center and Walter P. Reuther Psychiatric Hospital in Westland. The two facilities serve nearly 200 patients and are among the state’s five inpatient psychiatric hospitals for individuals who have severe mental illness or intellectual and developmental disabilities. Hawthorn Center opened its doors in 1956, while Walter Reuther began operations in 1979, and need to be replaced due to aging infrastructure. During construction of the new facility in Northville Township, staff and patients currently being cared for at Hawthorn Center will be moved to a separate unit at Walter P. Reuther Psychiatric Hospital to allow for the demolition of the current Hawthorn facility. Construction is expected to begin fall of 2023 and anticipated completion is in 2026.",,"Northville, MI",,
Michigan,Ionia State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ionia_State_Hospital,1883,,1885,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Michigan Asylum for Insane Criminals | Ionia Asylum   | Ionia State Hospital for the Criminally Insane,"The building of the Ionia State Hospital was authorized in 1883 and was opened under the name of the Michigan Asylum for Insane Criminals in 1885. It was found that this name was objectionable as not all of the patients in the hospital were criminals, so the name was changed by legislative action to Ionia State Hospital. The patients committed to this hospital were insane felons, criminal sexual psychopaths, insane convicts from other prisons, patients transferred from other state institutions that had developed dangerous or homicidal tendencies and persons charged with a crime but acquitted on the grounds of insanity. Initially the hospital patients were housed at the site of the Michigan Reformatory.
The hospital was called the North Branch and the farm located on Riverside Drive was called the South Branch. When a large fire broke out at the hospital, all of the rooms were needed to house prisoners, so all of the hospital patients were sent to the South Branch farm. Since that time, the hospital has been located on the grounds of the Riverside Correctional Facility. The hospital was used to treat the mentally ill as well as the criminally insane until 1972, when civilians were removed from the hospital. In 1977, the Legislature transferred the operation to the Department of Corrections when it began operation as a correctional facility. The facility was closed with the reopening of the Michigan Reformatory.

Michigan,Kalamazoo State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kalamazoo_State_Hospital,,1854,1859,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),,Western Michigan Asylum | Michigan Asylum for the Insane | Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital | Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital,"The choice of Kalamazoo as the location for the Michigan Asylum at Kalamazoo was helped by the fact that the governor was Epaphroditus Ransom, who once resided in Kalamazoo. Although the asylum was originally planned for a site in what is now the Stuart neighborhood, it was decided that this location was too close to downtown. So planners instead chose to place the hospital far out in the country, where they would never be bothered by these people. That location was on what is now Oakland Drive, where the hospital is still located.
The asylum was on the cutting edge of many forms of treatment. Through its close proximity to town, it was able to establish an innovative outpatient clinic in 1916 as well as a unique ""family-care"" program that placed patients in certified homes. The hospital also made use of colony farms, adjunct properties on which patients with milder illnesses — and those who today might be considered developmentally delayed — lived in familial farm settings. (One of these was near Kalamazoo's Asylum Lake.) They often raised livestock and produce for use at the hospital. The farms are examples of the limited treatment options for the mentally ill that were available before the 1950s. Electroshock therapy, insulin-induced comas and some barbiturate drugs resulted in limited reversals in thoughts and behavior of patients, he said.
Narcoleptic or anti psychotic drugs, such as Thorazine, that would revolutionize psychiatric treatment and the role of psychiatric hospitals in society. Patients who had been in the hospital for decades were suddenly responsive, able to care for themselves, and moving back to live with their families. By 1987, the number of patients had dropped to 550.By 1959 the State Hospital had a patient load of 3,500 and 900 staff that included doctors, nurses, attendants and service personnel. It became almost a city in its own right with a power plant, water system, bakery, laundry, library, canteen, garage, cannery, general kitchen and greenhouse. For many years the hospital was one of the largest employers in Kalamazoo.
Increased budget cuts by the state and improved treatment methods and medication for patients led to an inevitable decline in patient population. The hospital began to shrink, dropping steadily from a high of 3,500 patients in 1954-1955. Then in 1973, new treatment measures, such as rapid screening and intensive treatment, and early release into the community for other local agencies to take over, shrank the patient population even more. In 1980, the facility started laying off 88 employees and releasing 160 patients in response to the bare bones budget provided by the state. Finally, in 2000, then-Governor John Engler's administration decimated the state-run psychiatric hospitals in favor of community-based care at private agencies and hospitals.
Just a ghost of its former self, the Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital now has turned over most of its holdings on Oakland Drive to Western Michigan University, which has developed it as a health care corridor and research facilities, as well as the home of its current School of Nursing. Today (2008) there are only 2 original buildings still standing on the campus. The water tower was constructed in 1895 and quickly became a local landmark. It played prominently in the history of the city. The other is the ""gate cottage"" situated near Oakland Drive at the entrance to the hospital grounds. The gatehouse is ""carpenter gothic"" in style, featuring board and batten siding, a steep roof and ""gingerbread"" ornamentation. The house has been furnished with Victorian furniture and serves as a museum. When first built, it was used as the porter's residence and later housed a dozen women patients for a time.

It appropriated funds for only 2 cottages & 1 industrial building. The first patients were received November, 1895. Plans for a completed institution were prepared and closely adhered to. They provided for 20 buildings arranged in a quadrangle, 17 designed for care and reception of patients, 1 as an administration building, another as an assembly hall and the other as a kitchen/dining hall. These cottages which are all now erected, are arranged around a hollow square containing about 11 acres. All the buildings are connected by a covered walkway, which runs around the interior of the quadrangle. Outside of the original quadrangle, there have been built- a cottage for tuberculosis patients, a home for nurses & various industrial buildings. The hospital is located on a farm of about 720 acres.
The number of patients in the institution on June 30, 1920 was 1,037, which shows an overcrowding of 52 patients. The institution is modern in having equipment having both male and female receiving wards which are fitted with their own kitchens & dining rooms. The nurses' training school has been in successful operation since 1908. The school has a curriculum of three years. The inventory of the institution, lands, buildings, equipment etc. $1,078,942.

The first patients moved into the main building on January 1, 1952. and Dr. Philip Brown was selected as the first superintendent. One of the buildings on its campus later housed the Northville Residential Training Center, a separate institution. Not long after, the state was considering the small wooded piece of land between this institution and Hawthorne Center to place the Maxey Boys Training School, but the plan was rejected, and Maxey was built in Whitmore Lake.
The hospital was almost completely self-sufficient with its own laundry, kitchen, gymnasium, movie theater, swimming pool, and bowling alley, powered by a steam plant that supplied electricity and heat through a network of underground tunnels. In the 1970s, the state began to trim the mental health budget, closing some hospitals and reducing programs offered as doctors began relying on medicine and drugs to treat symptoms. Crowding became an issue at Northville, as the facility was regularly treating over 1,000 patients, but had only been designed for 650. Some patients had to sleep in the gymnasium until more rooms could be arranged.
In May 2003, the remaining 239 patients were transferred to other state facilities. The last patient left on May 16th, 2003, after which a skeleton staff began winding down operations. Detroit-based Adamo Group demolition company began what was expected to be a four-month demolition process in April, 2018 & was completed early 2019.

To supplement the rapidly overcrowding asylum at Kalamazoo, the Michigan state legislature established the new Eastern Asylum for the Insane in 1873 (renamed to the Eastern Michigan Asylum before it even opened), to be located in an eastern part of the state near the growing population center of Detroit, where many of Kalamazoo's patients where coming from. Members for a locating board were selected, and after considering potential sites at Detroit, which did not meet all of the requirements of the propositions, and at Holly, which had the advantage of railway lines running both North/South and East/West. But Holly was felt by the board to being too close in proximity to Flint, the location of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, since it was a policy of the state to distribute its institutions. the Board selected the site at Pontiac known as the ""Woodward farm"" in June, 1874. This site had the advantages of good soil for farming, a raised elevation that insured pleasant views, fresh air, and good drainage, wells would be able to supply ample fresh water, and it was adjacent to a primary railway line.
Dr. E.H. VanDeusen, Medical Superintendent of the Kalamazoo asylum, supplied the ground plans for the new asylum building, and architect Elijah E. Myers, of Detroit (who was also the architect for the new State Capital building in Lansing), prepared the elevation and working drawings. On December 16th, 1874, the Board of Trustees approved the plans and bids for the construction of the new asylum were called for.
The center building serves to divide the sexes. The longitudinal divisions are the wards proper, consisting of a central corridor with rooms on each side, each room occupied by a single patient, and belonging to him exclusively. These rooms vary in size from nine by twelve feet, to eleven feet eight inches by twelve feet eight inches, the larger size predominating, and the clear space between floor and ceiling is in every case thirteen feet.
The corridors are used as day-rooms, while the large bay-window in the centre of each main corridor affords the opportunity for the inmates in common to enjoy the sunshine and to look without. The large rooms in the front of the transverse division can either be used as day-rooms or parlors, or as associated dormitories for a special class of patients.
In the four main transverse divisions are grouped the dining-rooms, bath-rooms, clothes-rooms, lavatories, water-closets, and shafts, and it will be seen that each ward has a group of these auxiliary rooms readily accessible. The long, narrow wards render it possible to admit light and sunshine into each patient's room, while the transverse divisions perfect the classification by dividing the wards, and serve to break the view, so that patients in the different wards cannot shout across and annoy each other.
Each story of the centre building and wings is a counterpart of the one shown. A basement, nine feet clear space, is excavated beneath the entire main building. The divisions in the basement corresponding to the corridors and passages in the first story are made tight, and afford continuous air-passages for the supply and distribution of fresh air. From these basement corridors a great number of flues start, and lead within the walls to the corridors of each story. Constant and regulated ventilation is secured by means of a large fan, situated in the shop building, and driven by steam-power. The air from the fan-room is forced by the fan through large underground air-ducts or tunnels, six feet by eight feet, into the basement, and thence a constant stream passes up each flue, and is distributed to every portion of the building.
In addition to these supply-flues, each single room has a separate and distinct ventilating flue of it's own for the exit of vitiated air, leading within the brick walls directly to the attic, and the larger rooms have two or more such flues. The air forced into the corridors finds no egress except up these flues to the attics, and out through the large ventilators placed on the roof.
Steam will be used for heating, --mainly, indirect radiation. Beneath the chapel is a large pipe-duct, designed to conduct steam- and water-pipes from the boilers and pumps at the shops forward to the main building. These steam-pipes on reaching the centre building branch right and left, and extend within the air-passages through the basement to the extreme divisions. In the basement, at the base of the supply-flues, radiators or coils of pipe are placed, each connected with the steam-main. The air in its passage to the flue is forced to contact with the hot surface of the iron, and is warmed. In addition to this indirect radiation, a system of summer pipes, to be used in chilly or damp weather, when the main apparatus is not in operation, will extend through the building, connected with direct radiators at various points. Within the pipe-shafts, accessible at all times, will be the pipes for distributing hot and cold water, and the waste- and soil-pipes leading from the bath-rooms, lavatories, and water-closets to the sewers.
The sweepings on the various wards will be passed through an opening in the base-board into a dust-shaft, and will fall directly to the basement. Soiled clothes will be similarly dropped to the basement through shafts provided for the purpose, whence they will be taken to the laundry. There are also drying-shafts for drying dish-clothes and towels, and for thoroughly ventilating the sinks connected with each dining-room. Other shafts are divided at each story by means of lattice or open floor. Inside of some are placed boots and shoes, or brooms; in others pails, mops, etc. A current of air driven up through these shafts removes at once all obnoxious scents from the building.
A car track, for the distribution of food, leads from the general kitchen both North and South through the basement. Connecting with each dining-room on each floor is a dumb-waiter, which raises the food from the car in the basement to the dining-rooms where needed. Thus, one kitchen will supply sixteen dining-rooms within the wards, besides preparing food for the domestics and shop help.
A four inch brick arch forms the ceiling of each inmate's room, and of the corridors. This arched ceiling receives the plastering, and serves both as a deafening and as a protection in case of fire. The floor-joists are above the arches, but not in contact. In rooms too large to be arched, and in the centre building, the same end is attained by laying two sets of joist, but disconnected, the upper set carrying the floor, the lower set the ceiling and the mortar deafening.
Iron sash will be used throughout the wards, but they are made the same in form as wood sash, and are painted white to make the resemblance more perfect.
Exterior walls rest on concrete two feet deep, and from three feet two inches to four feet six inches wide; the interior walls rest on one foot two inches of concrete. With few exceptions all walls are carried up to the roof, which they support. The frame-work for the roof can therefore be made comparatively light. The roof covering is slate, except the tin deck-roof of the centre building.
In stone ornamentation the main building is rich, and the great variety in the forms of the stone-work is a noticeable feature. Cornices of wood; ventilators of galvanized iron. A central tower, a tower at each end, peaks ascending from bay projections in front, and from ventilators on the roof, break the monotonous lines necessary in so extensive a building, and give a pleasing effect.
The Eastern Michigan Asylum Historic District is comprised of forty-four randomly located structures. Many of the buildings are extensions of the original main building, which, as a result, has grown into a vast, spiderlike megastructure. The rambling, three and one-half story, main building built in 1875 to 1878 originally consisted of a center building containing offices and staff quarters with two identical wings, one for men and one for women. Large extensions were added to each of the patients' wings in several stages between 1882 and 1895 to match the original building. These buildings, designed by Elijah E. Myers, are picturesque structures in the High Victorian style made of red brick with elaborate steeply pitched, hipped, patterned slate roofs with multiple towers and pinnacles. Shallow buttresses accent the exterior design, reinforcing the vertical massing of the towers and bay windows. Cornices are made of wood and metal and the roof ventilators are of galvanized iron. Further, hipped-roofed, brick additions were made to the 1880s wings in 1906 and 1914. In 1938 extensive additions of Tudor design were made in front of the original building connected to the older structure by a narrow passage. In addition to the main building complex, architecturally significant buildings in the complex include the Sawyer and Vinton buildings, which were constructed in 1917 and 1893 respectively, and the Italian Renaissance style chapel built in 1907 designed by Smith, Hinchman and Grylls of Detroit.

Michigan,Traverse City State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Traverse_City_State_Hospital,,,1885,Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Gordon W. Lloyd,Northern Michigan Asylum for the Insane | Traverse City Regional Psychiatric Hospital,"Northern Michigan Asylum for the Insane was established in 1885 as the demand for a third psychiatric hospital, in addition to those established in Kalamazoo and Pontiac, Michigan, began to grow. Lumber baron Perry Hannah, “the father of Traverse City,” used his political influence to secure its location in his home town. Under the supervision of prominent architect Gordon W. Lloyd, the first building, known as Building 50, was constructed with Victorian-Italianate? style according to the Kirkbride Plan.
Under Dr. James Decker Munson (1848-1929), the first superintendent from 1885 to 1924, the institution expanded. 12 housing cottages and 2 infirmaries were built between 1887 and 1903 to meet the specific needs of more male and female patients. The institution became the city’s largest employer and contributed to its growth.
Long before the advent of drug therapy in the 1950s, Dr. Munson was a firm believer in the “beauty is therapy” philosophy. Patients were treated through kindness, comfort, pleasantry, and exposure to the asylum’s plentiful arrangements of flora provided year round by its own greenhouses and the variety of trees Dr. Munson planted on the grounds. Restraints, such as the straitjacket were forbidden. Also, as part of the “work is therapy” philosophy, the asylum provided opportunities for patients to gain a sense of purpose through farming, furniture construction, fruit canning, and other trades that kept the institution fully self-sufficient.
While the hospital was established for the care of the mentally ill, its reach expanded during outbreaks of tuberculosis, epilepsy, typhoid, diphtheria, influenza, and polio. It also cared for the elderly, and was used to trained nurses. After Munson’s retirement, James Decker Munson Hospital was honorably established on the grounds in 1926, which was operated by the state well after his death and into the 1950s. It was then replaced by Munson Medical Center, the largest hospital in northern Michigan.
With the gradual success in drug therapies in the 1970s, many patients were cured and/or improved, leaving many of the buildings empty. This, in addition to changes in mental health care philosophy, the decline of institutionalization, and cuts in funding, the Traverse City Regional Psychiatric Hospital was forced to shut down in 1989.
Starting in 2000, The Minervini Group began negotiating with the Grand Traverse Commons Redevelopment Corporation and secured an agreement to renovate the historic buildings. Their efforts have led to the gradual, but successful preservation and development of the Building 50 as part of The Village at Grand Traverse Commons, offering an array of residential and commercial opportunities. By 2005, the southernmost wing and Hall 20 (Phase One) were fully completed and in use. The 100,000 square foot Mercato Phase of the former Building 50 is currently under reconstruction and will be occupied by Fall 2007. Also on the site, other buildings are being renovated for new uses. These include an urban winery, a fair trade coffee roaster, and a brick oven bakery that will all be open for Summer 2007.

Michigan,Ypsilanti State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ypsilanti_State_Hospital,1929,1930,1932,Demolished,Pavilion Plan,,Ypsilanti Regional Psychiatric Hospital | Center for Forensic Psychology,"During the 1920s the necessity for an additional state hospital became apparent. The combined capacity of the existing state hospitals was 1,900 beds short of what was considered adequate. In 1929 Governor Green proposed that a fifth state hospital be developed. The first appropriation of $1.5 million for the fiscal year ending 1930 was passed. Ypsilanti was chosen because of it's population density and proximity to the University Center in Ann Arbor as well as it's availability of land. Purchase of the 1,209 acres was begun in 1929.
On June 16, 1930 the breaking of ground was underway. The following year the Legislature formalized the name and function for the institution. The architectural firm of Albert Kahn designed the buildings and contracts were let out for construction work to 35 separate companies. Construction work was pushed at what was described as a ""miracle pace"".
The first patients were admitted one day short of the 1 year mark since the groundbreaking. At the time of the formal dedication, July 28, 1931, the physical plant consisted of the receiving hospital and administration building (""A"" building), C-1 and C-2 blocks with combined facilities for approximately 900 patients; the unit containing 6 apartments (""J"" building); dormitory and apartments for employees (K-1); powerhouse, warehouse & the superintendents quarters. All main buildings to which patients would have need of access were connected by underground tunnels.
At the conclusion of the first year of operation (1932) 922 patients were living at Ypsilanti State Hospital. There were 239 employees and 116 on the nursing attending force. The total cost for maintaining a patient was .80 cents per day. During the Depression salaries were reduced moderately and personnel received a cutback. The effect was to delay expansion at a time when environmental pressures placed increasingly intolerable stress upon the individual, resulting in overcrowding and waiting list reached new highs.
At virtually the same time the federal and state governments stepped in and in late 1936, plans were drawn for further expansion. C-3, C-4, C-5 and C-6 were completed in 1937. Occupational Therapy Center and buildings B-3& B-4 were begun that same year, formal dedication made in 1938. Difficult as the economic situation was, therapy and service to aptients were continually re-evaluated and new avenues explored. The end of fiscal year 1936 had seen hydrotherapy give 11,807 treatments including ""needle"" showers, fan douches, jet douches, salt glows, general massages, local massages Sitz baths, foot baths, ultraviolet radiations, electric light bakes, cold wet sheet packs, continuous baths, electric light cabinets bubble baths, hot fomentations, colloidal baths and surgical dressings.
During World War 2 the hospital struggled with the problem that plagued all non-military establishments, shortage of personnel. The total personnel dropped approximately 35%. At the same time the patient population and turnover continued unabated. A measure of relief was afforded by the use of 75 conscientious objectors, however this only fulfilled part of the shortfall.
After the end of the war the building program continued. Buildings B-5 & B-6 were completed in 1948; in 1954 the Administration section was remodeled and a third story added for additional office space. YSH was the first state hospital in Michigan to have a separate chapel from other buildings.
A survey of the hospital's buildings in 1969 found that they were functionally obsolete because the units ""were all designed for custodial care of the insane and are not well suited for a therapeutic program of care and treatment for the mentally ill."" By the end of the 1960's YSH saw it's patient population begin a steady decline. Gov. John Engler sought to cut state spending on mental health. Under Engler, State Mental Health Director James Haveman Jr. sought to close all the state's mental hospitals. Ypsilanti State Hospital - by now renamed Ypsilanti Regional Psychiatric Hospital - was one of the first to go, closed in 1991.
A small portion of Ypsilanti State Hospital remained in use as the Center for Forensic Psychiatry until 2005 when a new building for the Center for Forensic Psychiatry just north of the old hospital was opened. By August 2008 all the buildings were demolished and a new Toyota research facility was built on the site.

Michigan,Haven Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Haven_Sanitarium,,,1932,Demolished,Single Building,,,"In the summer of 1926, industrialist Fred Marvin Shinnick began construction of a large country estate in Avon Township (now Rochester Hills), just west of the village of Rochester. Shinnick, who was born in Detroit in 1877, was secretary-treasurer of the Briggs Manufacturing Company, which during the period between the world wars was the nation's largest independent producer of automobile bodies. He also owned and operated the Rochester Dairy during the twenties.
In 1932, according to Fred Shinnick's obituary, he and his wife Lillian decided to convert their home into a private psychiatric hospital. Their reasons were not stated, but the economic realities of the Great Depression were more than likely a major factor. Large estates were costly to operate and many passed out of private hands or were converted to other uses during the difficult Depression years. Shinnick operated The Haven Sanitarium until his retirement in 1938, at which time his son, Graham, took over as hospital administrator. The Haven was known for treating well-to-do patients whose identities and privacy were carefully guarded. Rumors swirled that some of Hollywood's famous stars were numbered among its patients over the years.
The April 6, 1945, edition of the Lake Orion Weekly Review noted in a segment titled, “Happenings of 10 Years Ago,” that “Capt. S. Brines of Detroit, father of Mrs. A.J. Huggett, has been at ‘The Haven,’ a private sanitorium (sic) operated by Mr. and Mrs. F. Shinnick in their beautiful home in Rochester, the past two weeks.” As with most facilities like The Haven, area residents were occasionally unnerved by its presence in their community. Patient escapes, though rare, were announced in the local paper.
By the late 1940s, The Haven was gaining publicity for its youth program, called the Rochester Plan. The Haven partnered with the Rochester School District to assist local children dealing with what was then defined as mental illness. The resulting plan was hailed in newspapers across the Midwest, including Iowa’s Oelwein Daily Register in the article “Rochester Counsels Its Children” by Robert Goldman, published Feb. 22, 1949.
The Haven operated as a psychiatric hospital for thirty-six years, but closed in 1968 due to declining occupancy and rising operating costs. The once grand Shinnick home sat vacant thereafter, and owing to its location so far off the main road, became a magnet for squatters, vandals and teens looking for a place to party. The caretaker and the Oakland County Sheriff's Department fought an ongoing battle to run the intruders off the property, but despite their efforts the old house was torn apart piece by piece.
Late in the evening of November 2, 1973, the Rochester Fire Department was called to a fire at The Haven. They found numerous problems in fighting the blaze and sounded two more alarms, answered by the Brooklands and Avondale departments. Fire department historian William A. Cahill recorded that the nearest hydrant was on the south side of Walton, so fire fighters had to lay 1,200 feet of hose to reach the house, and cars on Walton hampered their efforts by running over the hose line. Further, the heavy slate roof on the Tudor-revival house created an oven effect in the building. A large crowd of gawkers and onlookers added to the difficulties.
The end of The Haven came when the fire chewed away the roof supports and sent the heavy slate crashing down. Near dawn on November 3, after 40,000 gallons of water had been poured onto the blaze, the house was nothing but a smoldering ruin.
A few years after the fire, the property was redeveloped and became the Grosse Pines subdivision, but one reminder of The Haven still stands in testimony to the property's former use. The ledge rock wall and gates that adorned the Walton Boulevard frontage of The Haven property are yet visible among the tall pines at the entrance to the subdivision. [1]",1968,"Rochester, MI",,

The new facility was officially commissioned as a hospital on April 7, 1910, and, in 1922, Providence Hospital was incorporated separately.
Both House and Hospital used the West Grand Boulevard building. Reports of the number of beds at opening vary from 500 to 600. The grand, castle-like structure was quite elegant, with arched ceilings, ornate pillars and inlaid floors. The facility also featured a beautiful chapel and sun gallery at the rear of the building, overlooking a courtyard.

This was Michigan's first private mental institution, and allegedly catered mostly to the affluent. It was started by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. In 1855 the Sisters of St. Mary's Hospital began to care for the mentally ill, who had formerly been confined to prisons or the county poor house. In 1860, they opened a seperate facility named the Michigan State Retreat, which was incorporated in 1883 as St. Joseph's Retreat. The original building stood on 140 acres overlooking the Rouge River. It was later enlarged to house 400 patients. At first these were Civil War veterans, and later alcoholics, drug addicts, and other ""incurables."" The first telephone installed in Dearborn was at the Retreat in 1889.
It was closed and demolished in 1963. Dearborn High School was built on land that formerly belonged to the Retreat. A historic plaque stands at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Outer Drive, marking the site.
Notably, the hospital was designed along the same lines as the other Kirkbrides within the state.  Also Florida state legislator and U.S. Senator Charles Wm. Jones (1834 - 1897) died in the hospital on October 11, 1897.",,"Dearborn, MI",,

The school was opened in Coldwater on May 21, 1874. Once admitted, children participated in ""family-like"" life in cottages and a placing-out program. A third of each day was used for schoolwork, a third for recreation and entertainment, and a third for acquiring work skills. Children learned reading, spelling, counting, calisthenics, singing, cyphering and slate drawing. By the turn of the century, the facility had become the only home in Michigan admitting both non-disabled and disabled children.
In 1939 the Children's Village became the Coldwater State Home and Training School, and persons of all ages with more serious handicaps were admitted. By 1960 there were 2,900 residents. During the 1970s, special education, training and living experiences in communities reduced the number of residents to less than 700. Renamed the Coldwater Regional Center of Developmental Disabilities in 1978, the remodeled facility provides training programs for independent living and self-help.  In 1985 the center began to convert to a psychiatric hospital, and in 1986 its name changed to the Coldwater Regional Mental Health Center. The Coldwater Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities closed in 1992. The Michigan Department of Corrections acquired the facilities for the Florence Crane Correctional Facility and Camp Branch, a minimum security prison camp. Camp Branch closed in 2009 and Florence Crane closed in 2011, but Lakeland Correctional Facility is still operational.

The buildings were declared fire and safety hazards.

Michigan,Lapeer State Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lapeer_State_Home,,1894,1895,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Lapeer State Home & Training School | Michigan Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptic | Michigan Home and Training School | Oakdale Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities,"In August 1893, Gov. John T. Rich, an Elba Township native, named a committee to decide the location of a state home for the feeble minded. Lapeer was in the running along with Saginaw, Bay City, Charlotte and Greenville. Lapeer was selected, partly because of the creek running through the property. It was thought the creek would be handy for sewage disposal, but a neighbor didn’t like that idea and the city ended up having to extend a sewer line to the property. The Michigan Home for the Feeble-Minded and Epileptic opened in June 1895, and there were more than 1,000 applications for employment prior to its opening. Later that year, in November, there were 91 male and 40 female inmates.
In 1910, a smallpox epidemic broke out at the asylum, and a company of the Flint National Guard camped out on the grounds that fall and winter to keep the disease contained to the asylum grounds. Many victims of the smallpox epidemic were buried in the now-forlorn cemetery at the southern edge of the grounds.
By 1919, there were 1,560 patients, and patient load peaked at more than 4,600 in the middle of the century. The home was the largest in the state and one of the largest in the entire country, and it was the largest employer in Lapeer County. Treatment options for the “feeble-minded” were changing by then, and the number of residents began its final decrease. By 1976 there were fewer than 1,500 patients but a record 1,386 employees.
The facility had a number of different names during its operation: The Michigan Home for the Feeble-Minded and Epileptic, the Michigan Home and Training School, the Lapeer State Home and Training School and, finally, the Oakdale Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities. Many who remember it now either refer to it as simply “the State Home” or “Oakdale.”
In February of 1990, it was announced that the state home would close in October of that year. The last three residents left the center at the end of September. In 1992, 400 acres that was once Oakdale was sold to the City of Lapeer for $1, and between 1992 and 1996, most of the buildings were demolished, and what was once a grand institution that was home to many and a living for many others became a memory.
Demolition at the old Oakdale facility was a huge project. Many of the buildings were old and in disrepair. In the final appraisal, two buildings were saved: building #45, which had been a nursery and built in 1958, and Building #71, which had been the administration building. A grant from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint for $180,000 brought building #45 up to school safety codes. Building #71 which was a newer building, received a $1.3 million transformation into Chatfield School, the county's first charter school. According to the Neighbors newsletter, total demolition of Oakdale for $550,000 returned the property to a clean site ready for development. A grant for that amount was funded by the state's ""Clean Michigan” program. The property now belongs to Mott Community College.
Main Image Gallery: Lapeer State Home
Investigation by a relative of Fred Aslin, a former resident of Lapeer State Home, revealed that he and 2,336 other people were sterilized at the Lapeer State Home as a result of state policy. In the 12 years of Aslin’s stay at Lapeer, half a dozen medical doctors repeatedly passed on the diagnosis made by Doctors James F. Darby and William Charlton Edminson from St. Ignace that classified Aslin as a “feeble-minded moron.” In 1944, at the age of 18, Fred Aslin had been sterilized against his will, without having the procedure explained to him. Aslin’s story made national news when he filed a lawsuit in 2000. But the case was dismissed because the relevant statute of limitations had expired.
A cemetery contains an unknown number of remains on the former hospital property. Graves are marked with a small brick with a name and number. They can be found in the Oak dale park nearby.

Michigan,Mount Pleasant State Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mount_Pleasant_State_Training_School,1891,1892,1893,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School | Mt. Pleasant Branch of the Michigan Home and Training School | Mt. Pleasant Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities,"On January 3, 1893, the U.S. government opened an Indian boarding school at Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. It offered a nine-year program, beginning with kindergarten. By 1911 the Mt. Pleasant school had eleven buildings, including dormitories for both the girls and boys. Although the school grew from an original enrollment of 59 students to more than 300 students a year, it created tension among the Indian community. Some Indian parents opposed sending their children away to learn “the white man’s ways.” However, the poverty and hopelessness of living on reservations led other parents to hope that these boarding schools promised their children a better life. Sometimes, the government took Indian children and forced them to attend the school.
Life at the boarding schools was often a shock. One girl recalled being held down as her hair was cut short. She later explained, “among our people” only “cowards” wore short hair. Another student remembered that attending a boarding school was like being “suddenly dumped” into “another world, helpless, defenseless, bewildered, trying desperately and instinctively to survive it all.”
Students awoke to reveille, dressed in military-style uniforms, marched to class and went to bed with taps. Half the day was spent in class; the other half was spent in vocational training. The students also kept vegetable gardens and apple orchards and cared for livestock. During the summer months, they worked as seasonal laborers on area farms. English was the school’s official language, and students might have their mouth washed out with soap if they spoke their native Indian language. Students were also encouraged to take a Christian name in place of their Indian name. They had little privacy, sleeping in dormitories with 30 to 40 students in a large room.
Violating the rules led to punishment, which could be harsh. Sometimes students were beaten with a strap or rubber hose. Some endured the school; others ran away. The Mt. Pleasant Indian School closed in 1933. In exchange for the buildings, the state of Michigan agreed to allow the Indian children to attend public schools.
When the facility reopened in 1934 as the Michigan Home and Training School, the care of the developmentally disabled was much different than today’s standards. The first residents were men from the state home in Lapeer who provided labor to operate the farm and dairy operations at the facility, and were available for hire by community members for day jobs. At this time, the only hospital located in Mt. Pleasant existed at the ‘Michigan Home,’ the terms used by locals at the time for the Mt. Pleasant Center. In 1946 the institution was renamed Mt. Pleasant State Home and Training School.
The time between the opening of the facility in 1934 until the reforms in Special Education laws and practices in the 1960s and 70s made for a dark time at the facility. Care was confined to only food and shelter. Efficiency over anything else was emphasized during this time, and living conditions did not meet the space and privacy requirements of today. Residents were handled in groups of up to 50, and photos show dormitories filled with wall-to-wall beds in day rooms that slept 50 to a room. A building spree happened in the 1950s, with buildings designed to provide a custodial level of care in the most expedient manner. Many of the buildings still in existence on the grounds today were constructed during this time.
Cottage 3 was converted by a Detroit architect in 1950 to what was known as the Crib Care dormitory, and had wall-to-wall cribs on two of its three floors, with toddlers in the basement. More than 200 infants and children with varying degrees of disability were housed there, with 25% of the children diagnosed with Down’s Syndrome. Care at that time, being limited to food and shelter, led to the young residents not getting enough exercise to maintain muscle tone and mobility.
As late as the 1960s, one-piece coveralls were the uniform for all patients. Around that time, staff ‘on its own initiative’ started attempting to work with residents in small groups, or one on one, with planned activities or arts and crafts on a limited basis. The first teachers arrived at the facility in 1966, when Public Law 89-10 made provisions for providing teachers to the institutionalized handicapped.
In the 1970s an extensive renovation program was held, and the institution was renamed the Mt. Pleasant Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities. The renovations focused on making the facility less institutional and more homelike. The interiors were changed from large day rooms housing groups of 50 to apartments holding no more than 16 residents, with snack kitchens. Family dining over institutional feeding was introduced. The Special Education Law of 1974 required that all persons under age 26 who were capable of being transported must be able to attend school, and programs were created individually by interdisciplinary teams for those over age 26, for work activities or sheltered employment. Community-based residential living began to be emphasized at this time, allowing for group home setups in the surrounding neighborhoods. Admissions began to decline as the push for community integration began. [2]  The facility closed in 2008; the State of Michigan made the decision to close due to budget shortfalls at the state level and a dwindling number of patients being assisted at the location.",2008,"Mt.

Michigan,Allegan County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Allegan_County_Poor_Farm,1849,,1870,Demolished,Single Building,,Allegan County Medical Care Facility (Current),"On 14 January 1866, the Allegan County superintendents of the poor recommended the purchase of the J. P. Pope farm for this purpose, at a cost of $7000.  This recommendation was accepted and the purchase was made the following day.  A second poorhouse was erected on the farm in January 1869 at a cost of $2090.07 (1907, p. 15).  In 1870, the original house was found to be in need of razing, and it was replaced with what came to be called “the main building” completed in October of that year.  The insane asylum was the next addition to the complex.  The 20-room hospital-style building received its first inmates on 1 January 1876.  Thursday morning (Feb. 1, 1883) at about six o'clock the main building in the county poor farm was wholly destroyed by fire, and it was only by hard work that the neighboring insane asylum was saved. On 20 Oct 1898, a juvenile home was added to the Poor Farm to house “insane children” separate from the adult asylum.  Next, a hospital “for the isolation of contagious persons” was appended to the main building, completed on 10 January 1899 and a telephone was installed in the main building as part of that same project.
The facility served as the county’s “debtor’s prison” and asylum, i.e. an encampment for “undesirables,” from 1866 to 1914. At that time, the poor housing was demolished.   Debtor’s prisons are no longer legal under the present Michigan Constitution. The poor farm was closed in 1968 as construction of Allegan County Medical Care Facility, our current Community, began on this same property.

In 1889 the County Poor farm was moved to our present location in Kearney Township, south of Bellaire off M-88. The County built a two story wooden structure and allocated a small amount of money to cover clothing and linen expenses. Some of the reasons for the admissions were old age, poverty, sickness and blindness. Orphans were housed at the County Poor Farm and there is an entry of a woman and her children who stayed at the poor farm while her husband was in jail. At that time the residents of the Poor Farm had to be self-sufficient. They raised their own vegetables and meat on the premises. All who were able worked for the good of the community.
In 1902 a barn was placed on the property for livestock. The building housing residents burned completely to the ground in June 1926, and the residents were temporarily moved to the Forest Home Township Hall. Late in 1926 the Board of Supervisors contracted to build a new home to house up to 35 residents at a cost of $39,496.00. This building was completed in 1927. In 1939 the State of Michigan passed Public Act 280 that changed the direction from a Poor Farm to an infirmary to provide medical and nursing care to the needy. It operated until 1948. Then the County moved into acute care, and the Poor Farm was renamed Meadow Brook Hospital. The hospital had one floor for emergency services; obstetrics and general care for an adult population with chronic illnesses. The second floor of the hospital housed the caregivers. At that time the medical community was made up of Dr. Rodgers and Dr. Glenny from Bellaire, Dr. Sealey from Central Lake, Dr. Gingrich and Dr. Krippen from Mancelona. The nursing staff consisted of one nurse and one nursing assistant on each shift for a 24-hour period.
The hospital continued to raise poultry and livestock on the property until 1957. In 1958, the second floor was expanded for more patient services at a cost of $412,000. The third floor was added in 1962 to increase the resident population total to 69, at a cost of $116,000.00. In 1964 the Obstetric Department of Meadow Brook Hospital was closed. During the time the hospital was open, a total of 1,627 babies were born in the facility. In 1982, two new nursing units were added bringing the total bed capacity to 113. All residents who were housed in Meadow Brook Hospital were moved into the new building. The cost for these additions was $2,481,000.00. In 1983, the hospital was remodeled to become Meadow View Apartments with 21 apartments for seniors for a total cost of $754,000.00.
At the present time Meadow Brook Medical Care Facility provides over 40,000 days per year of resident services with a capacity of 133 residents.",,"Bellaire, MI",,
Michigan,Berrien County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Berrien_County_Poor_House,1847,,,Active,Single Building,,Berrien County Infirmary | Berrien County Hospital and Infirmary | Lakeland Medical Center (Current),"The first official action of supervisors to support a County Poor-House and Farm is recorded and dated Oct 27, 1837. There must have been some sort of temporary arrangements made for the poor until the next major resolution was passed.
In 1847 the County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution to purchase land in Berrien Township for the establishment of a poor farm. They purchased this property from Richard McOmber who had settled in this area in about 1835. It was located in the Northeast , section 17 and at that time had only 160 acres with buildings and land.  After sale of the property he moved to Buchanan, in the same county.
Additional acreage about 32 acres, was added later. The original house built in 1847 was about 18 X 26 feet.   John Tate had the contract for taking care of the home and inmates from May 28, 1847 to Apr 1, 1848 for $295.00.  In 1851 a new system for caring for the poor and financially helpless of Berrien County to house them came into being.  Mr. H. W. Hawley took charge of the farm.
The Poor Farm was totally destroyed by fire on December 8, 1868 (Ref: St. Joseph Herald Dec 12, 1868.) It was thought that the fire might have caught from the kitchen chimney. The keeper and inmates attempted in vain to save the building but it burnt to the ground. When saving the building proved futile the inmates heroically concentrated on saving as much as they could of the furnishings, bedding etc.. There were approximately 32 pauper residents living there at that time. In the interim for being rebuilt they were given lodging in the village of Berrien where a building was rented for temporary housing. The County Home was rebuilt in 1869-1870. St. Joseph Herald (Saint Joseph, Michigan) states in the January 22, 1870 edition that the poor-farm buildings are completed. The newer home was that of brick and ran well over budget.
It should be noted that S. C. Wheeler was the Superintendent of the Poor Farm in the late 1870's and was replaced by Capt. Bradley in about 1879. There are quite a few news articles about salaries and the replacement of Mr. Wheeler much to the chagrin of many of those who respected him. In referencing the history books, for the year ending Sept. 30, 1879, there were fifty-nine males and thirty-eight females for a total of ninety-seven and an average of fifty-six that found refuge at the home at point or another during that year.   On April 1, 1880 the smoke house at the Poor Farm burned. No other buildings were affected and contents were partially saved but in damaged condition.
What happened to the Orphans of the county? In 1891 Dr. Amos Barlow was made Superintendent of the Michigan Children's Home Society and the society was Incorporated and called the Michigan Children's Home Society in 1893. Dr. Barlow was considered one of the founders of the home in the St. Joseph area and remained until January 12, 1908. Mrs. Cora Lamping replaced him. Within a few years the home found families to adopt or foster several hundred Orphans.
Through the years the farm became a colony within itself with orchards, vegetable gardens, corn and grain fields, barns, cows, chickens and pigs. Everyone who was physically capable did chores that they could manage. One couple that managed the farm in 1924 and several years after, were Mr. & Mrs. Edward Israel, who became very well known in the area. Before that Mr. and Mrs. Daniel N. Haviland were the executives. Also in the 1920's it should be noted that Charles Miller was the Superintendent for over 16 years.
In 1926 it was realized that the old structure was in desperate need of renovation and repair as some of it had become a ""tinder box"". Things had been stretched as far as they could be stretched and even an old out building was turned into living quarters. Conditions were unacceptable with over crowding of the inmates at these county funded buildings. When toured by county officials it was noted that there were two rooms set up as a hospital ward and another two fitted with heavy screening on the windows and set up for the mentally insane to keep them from harming themselves.  It was voted on and in June of 1928 there was a new $50,000 addition was added to the existing home. The new structure was made of brick and was a fine two story building with two Men's dormitories, a lounging room, general dining room and kitchen.
1936 brought more change and a new structure was built and completed in 1937. In addition to housing the unfortunate it also was operated as a hospital for local residents and renamed, Berrien County Hospital and Infirmary located near Berrien Center. It would later evolve into the Berrien General Hospital Center and from there Lakeland Medical Center. The 200 acres continued to be used by different county facilities.",,"St. Joseph, MI",,

The county erected a frame building for the aged who had no means of support. Many of the residents were no longer able to work or had no family. Some had families who couldn’t care for them. The official name was the County Farm, but most referred to it as the Poor Farm.
The original building burned to the ground in 1905. The Board of Supervisors authorized $25,000 to build a large, three-story red brick building to house 64 “inmates,” as the residents were called at the time. The facility also included several farm buildings. From 1905 to 1958, the inmates farmed the land and raised cows, chickens, and pigs to supply food. In 1958, though, the building was condemned as a fire hazard and ruled as too expensive to repair.",,"Essexville, MI",,

Michigan,Eloise Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Eloise_Asylum,1839,,1841,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Wayne County Poorhouse | Eloise Hospital | Wayne County Asylum | Wayne County Psychiatric Hospital,"In 1839, only two years after Michigan had joined the Union, Wayne County paid $800 to buy a 160-acre farm in Nankin Township (now Westland). The purchase included a log cabin known as the Black Horse Tavern. The County erected an addition to the tavern building and used it to house 35 needy people, a keeper and his wife. They called it the Wayne County Poorhouse. Its first residents were transferred from another poorhouse at Gratiot and Mt. Elliott in Detroit . Many refused to move, claiming the new poorhouse was ""too far out in the wilderness."" And they were right -- at that time the corner of Michigan and Merriman was nearly two days by stage coach from Detroit.
But that was what the county officials had in mind. They wanted somewhere well out of sight to send what they saw as society's dregs -- the vagrants, vagabonds, drunkards, pilferers and brawlers. With such a broad charter, it wasn't long before the feeble-minded and the insane were being housed there. Records show that a Biddy Hughes was Eloise's first official mental patient, committed by her family in 1841. She was in her mid-30s when admitted and was kept there until her death 58 years later.
Prior to the 1840s, little distinction was made between rational and mentally ill inmates. A county report from the 1840s made reference to harsh restraints used to separate the mentally ill from other inmates. The mentally ill were housed on the upper floor of a farm building used to keep pigs.
County employee Stanislas M. Keenan reported in his 1913 book, ""The History of Eloise,"" that in the first few years people in the surrounding area heard ""the chained unfortunates roaring and shrieking in discord with the squealing pigs beneath."" Conditions improved in 1869 when the mentally ill were moved to a new building where they were supervised by a neighboring farmer and his wife. But the chains remained until 1881, when Dr. E.O. Bennett, Eloise's first medical superintendent, did away with them.
In 1894 the Wayne County Poorhouse got a new name. Freeman B. Dickerson, president of the county board overseeing care of the poor, renamed the facility Eloise, after his 5-year-old daughter. The county eventually split the facility into the Eloise Infirmary for the Sick and Elderly and the Eloise Hospital for the Insane.
In 1903, after a sharp increase in tuberculosis cases, it was recommended that these patients be separated from the general hospital population. A canvass hospital was erected consisting of two tents -- one for males and one for females. As the number of TB patients increased Eloise Sanitarium was built. In a report to the auditors in 1911, a Dr. Dutlitz says, ""The erection of this hospital was an answer to the public call."" He said physicians were practically unanimous in recommending open air treatment for tuberculosis of the lungs.
The patients at Eloise posed a special problem, however. By the time they got to Eloise they were in the final stages of the disease. They were sent there from other treatment centers when their personal funds were exhausted, leaving them candidates for the poorhouse. Eloise continued to operate what was essentially a TB hospital for indigents until 1923, when the State and City of Detroit began providing facilities.
In the 1930's Wayne County began feeling the effects of the Depression. Eloise grew rapidly as both the indigent and mentally ill populations multiplied. In 1932, a barracks was erected to house unemployed men. By 1934 the inmate population averaged more than 8,300, about 50 percent of them mentally ill, and the number of employees had risen to nearly 2,000. For residents, boredom was a major problem. A 1939 Detroit News article described the daily routine: ""The residents rise at 7 a.m. and go to bed at 7:30 p.m. Between times, they sit and stare at the wall, at their feet, at the windows. There is no exercise or organized social movement."" Some inmates received passes to leave the grounds where they became easy targets for policemen, who arrested and fined them for petty crimes. Most found the outside world difficult to cope with. Many spent their leaves at local bars and ended up in jail. Others walked the surrounding neighborhoods aimlessly..
Eloise grew into a city unto itself. Its 78 buildings included a fire department, 15-man police force, powerhouses, a cannery, bakery and fruit cellar, a sewage disposal plant a morgue, laundry facilities; a library and low-rent employee lodgings. Nearly 20 percent of the staff lived on the grounds.
In 1945, Eloise was renamed Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary. The new name was intended to reflect the modern ""scientific"" approaches to caring for the poor and mentally ill that had been instituted at the facility. Most, however, continued to refer to the facility as Eloise.
By the 1950's Wayne County General was considered one of the best hospitals in the nation. It played a major part in metro Detroit's health network. It was the only acute-care medical and surgical hospital between Detroit and Ypsilanti. Needy patients would have died without Wayne County General. A reporter who toured the facility in 1953 was moved by the ""pitiful cases"" -- ""the senile, the spastics, the polio victims and those with advanced multiple sclerosis.""  By the '50s, patients were benefiting from insulin and electric shock therapy, psychotherapy by psychiatrists and occupational and recreational therapy. Occupational therapy included farming, sewing, work in the hospital laundry and maintenance departments. Recreational therapy included classes in handiwork and a special division of music therapy.
Throughout its boom years, when the complex was caring for as many as 10,000 patients daily, the facility was plagued by reports of patient beatings, employee theft, mismanagement, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding. At one time 3,800 mental patients -- including 300 with tuberculosis -- were crammed into quarters designed for 2,500. As many as 125 women had to share five toilets.
By 1955 money problems had become acute. George E. Gullen Jr., chairman of the Wayne County chapter of the Michigan Society of Mental Health, figured that on a per patient basis, Wayne General was ""the most expensive mental hospital in the world."" The county continually sought ways to cut costs. One auditor questioned the practice of buying false teeth at $100 a set for indigent TB patients, after noting that $6,500 had been spent on dentures in one six-month period.
Not all was bleak at Eloise. A carnival was held each summer on the hospital grounds with booths built by patients. Patients also ran a coffee shop in the psychiatric building. ""They must face life and its stresses and we want them ready to do that,"" explained one of the doctors. Proceeds were used to buy recreational supplies.
By 1960 new theories for treatment of the mentally ill were developing, and Eloise kept in step. The goal was no longer to provide long term care, but to return patients to society as soon as possible. Most were kept less than 90 days and in 1964 only one in ten became permanent residents -- compared to nearly 50 percent previously. This success added to Eloise's money problems. The state chipped in for psychiatric expenses only after patients had been hospitalized for a year.
Wayne County also began ""mainstreaming"" -- getting the psychiatric patient back into the community each week. This sometimes caused problems. One patient was so excited about his weekend leave that he stole a car from the hospital parking lot. There was a high speed chase in which he was involved in five collisions and ran two police blockades. During the chase shots were fired, nearly missing a group of children at a school crossing. The inmate was taken into custody after running the car into a ditch.
As patient treatment was updated , so were the facilities. Older buildings were razed in the '60s and '70s and two new buildings were constructed -- a 511-bed medical hospital in 1962 and a long term care facility in 1974. The Walter Reuther Long Term Care Facility housed the surviving mentally ill and poor who had made Eloise their permanent home.
By 1987, six years after the facility's closing, Eloise had been reduced to eight buildings. Today, only a 5 buildings remain and all are empty. The county is currently working on a plan to redevelop the complex. The ""D"" building houses some Wayne County of [1]In November 2015, the Detroit Free Press reported that the 50-acre complex was put on sale for $1.5 million – which includes an fire station from the 1800s, a decommissioned power plant and two maintenance buildings. On March 29th, 2016 the former bakery building built in 1905, one of the last original buildings, was the victim of arson. The damage was enough to have the structure demolished. Morgan Development purchased the property in June of 2018.

Michigan,Houghton County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Houghton_County_Poor_House,,,1877,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Since the 1870s, the county funded a poor house and a 100-acre farm to provide for the basic needs of its people when they had nowhere else to go. It was meant to be as self sufficient as possible, and indeed the poor house and its farm was a model institution in its early years. Those who could work did, and those who could not enjoyed the view of Portage Lake. Men and women had separate quarters and had roles at the poor house in accordance with their gender and the times: men would work in the fields, or find a place in the blacksmith shop, machine shop, or stables, while women had sewing rooms and would prepare food.
The farm, as of 1910, supported 43 hogs, about 50 cows, and 200 chickens. It was more than adequate to feed the ‘inmates’, as they were called, whose population ranged from about 25 to 150 in normal years. Most of the elderly residents of the poor farm were able to leave following Michigan’s Public Act 280 of 1939, which directed counties to care for the aging regardless of cost. These state funds helped many of the former residents find better housing; those who wanted to move into other facilities usually could. Still, some had come to think of the old farm as their home. After a visit from a food inspector in 1953, the farm was shut down—the following year saw all the farm buildings torn down.

In 1877 a fine two-story house was built, having 25 rooms and costing about $4,000. In 1884 William Story was appointed Superintendent holding the office for seven years. The end of most for the Poor Farm operations occurred when Social Security was enacted in 1935. Many of the operations became housing for acute health issues such as tuberculosis or mental illness.
By 1936, the number of those in need surpassed the amount of space available to adequately serve the residents; 85 people were crowded into a building that was built to house 26. The building was in dire need of repairs and was condemned. A millage was passed in 1936 to begin construction on a new unit. The new structure was named, “Huron County Home,” to remove the negative connotation of the Poor Farm. During this time frame, farming operations were stopped and the livestock, as well as the farm equipment sold by public auction in 1957.
The facility adopted its latest name in 1966 when it became the “Huron County Medical Care Facility.” The third major renovation of the facility took place 1977-1979 at the expense of $1.4 million. This expansion allowed the facility to have beds on the entire third floor.The Huron County Medical Care Facility park and rose garden can be traced back to 1928 when a small group planted hardwood and pine seedlings in the now groomed area to provide residents of the home with a pleasant outdoor atmosphere. The park, as we have come to know it today, began construction in 1980.",,"Bad Axe, MI",,

Michigan,Jackson County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jackson_County_Poor_Farm,,,1839/1887,Demolished,Single Building,,Jackson County Infirmary,"Jackson County’s poor house/farm became one of the first created in the earliest days of Michigan statehood. Generation after generation of poor souls lived there. Some were blind, deaf or insane, and others just homeless for a variety of reasons. The 1881 “History of Jackson County” documented that 33 people — equal numbers of men and women — lived there then. The men worked about the farm and in the garden, barn and wood pile. The women performed household duties. Fire destroyed the original poor house about 1886 and a new wooden frame building with a brick exterior was built a year later.
After World War II, federal and state governments issued more mandates, and poor houses and farms began to vanish from the social landscape. Counties could no longer warehouse people, but they were expected to provide medical care. By 1950, Jackson County’s poor-home residents were so aged and infirm they were no longer capable of field work. The Social Services Board put the farm up for sale, and on Aug. 15, 1951, the Citizen Patriot reported the sale of 183 acres, for $18,350, to John Jenkins. By about 1960, the grand old poor home was in serious decline. The county put to voters a $1.7 million bond issue to build a new Jackson County Medical Care Facility on Lansing Avenue.
In February of 1963 nearly 90 residents were moved from the old poor home to the new building. And the old building sat empty — except for May 1963, when it briefly served as a hideaway for four escaped Southern Michigan Prison convicts. In the summer of 1964, the poor home was sold to local Seventh-day Adventists for $12,000. They built a school on the property, a short distance from the old home. On April 23, 1967, a father and two sons who had a contract to demolish the old home inadvertently started a fire. They were burning rubbish in an open area when sparks apparently settled in the home’s eaves. Within moments, the top of the building went up in flames.",1963,"Jackson, MI",,

Michigan,Midland County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Midland_County_Poor_Farm,1865,,,Preserved (Original building),Single Building,,Pinecrest Farms (Current),"In 1865, the Midland County Board of Supervisors allotted $2,000 for the purchase of Samuel P. Chapman's farm to be used as a poor farm for the county's ""poor and unfortunate."" The farm consisted of 80 acres (of which 50 were cultivated) a nine room farmhouse, a large barn, and several outbuildings. During the first year of operation, the County Poor Farm supported seven people including several orphans, various elderly people, and a Civil War veteran who was both mentally and physically handicapped by his military service. During the next 20 years, the Poor Farm was enlarged as needed. Additional acreage was purchased which was farmed by its inmates as a contribution to their support.
The early years of the 20th century, the Midland County Poor Farm was in need of new facilities. After nearly 40 years of use, the original structure was in dire need of repair. The limited space was sorely crowded by the increased number of inmates. In 1900, plans were announced to construct a new efficient County Poor Farm near the existing facilities, located on Gordonville Road. However, construction was delayed for several years due to county finances. Construction finally began in 1914, and took 18 months to complete. A local newspaper described Midland's now County Poor Farm as ""A handsome two-story brick structure constructed with an abundance of windows, thus allowing proper ventilation for its residents.""
By 1920, the Midland County Poor Farm was home to almost 40 residents from a wide variety of backgrounds. In the 1940s, the County Poor Farm's operations had developed into a hospital-like facility,providing convalescent care for the elderly. Its role dramatically changed, in accordance to the local communities needs. During the early 1960s, the Midland County Poor Farm location was purchased by Consumers Power Company for the construction of their Nuclear Power Plant facility. Midland County replaced the former county farm with the pleasant facility known as ""Pinecrest,"" located on West Olson Road.",,"Midland Township, MI",,

Michigan,Washtenaw County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Washtenaw_County_Poor_House,1836,,1844,Demolished,Single Building,,Washtenaw County Infirmary,"The County Farm Park, on the east side between Platt and Medford, is devoted to recreation such as jogging and gardening. But once it was the location of the County Poor House. Homeless people of both sexes and all ages lived there. The Poor House sheltered a diverse group of unfortunates: the insane, alcoholic, feeble, indolent, senile, retarded, handicapped, injured, sick, transient, or just down on their luck. Their common denominator was their poverty. Some stayed only for a short time, but others remained until they died. If no relative claimed the body, it was buried on the premises or given to the U-M medical school. Some human bones found in the 1960s when Washtenaw Avenue was being widened were at first believed to be Indian relics until someone figured out that the road extended over the area used for the poor house cemetery.
Poor farms were the nineteenth century solution to poverty. Reformers such as Dorothea Dix, a pioneer in the movement for specialized treatment of the insane, believed that placing people on working farms could make them into contributing members of society and also relieve the public of paying for their care. Most of the people who lived in poor houses were not able to work, however, or if they could, were not very productive. Income from crops raised at the Washtenaw County Poor House helped defray costs, but except for a few years during the Civil War, it was never enough to cover all expenses.
The land for the Washtenaw County Poor House was purchased by the county in 1836 from Revolutionary War veteran Claudius Britton, to comply with an 1830 Michigan law directing each county to build a poor house. The county hired a keeper, always a local person with a farming background, who lived on the premises with a wife who cooked for the residents (or ""inmates,"" as they were called in the official reports).
The farm included orchards of apples, peaches, and pears; livestock (pigs, cattle, sheep, and chickens); and gardens with vegetables and grains. George Campbell, who grew up on nearby Cobblestone Farm, recalled, ""I would often see poor farm residents out in the fields pitching hay, always under supervision. The men worked the farm as long as it was done with horse power, but they couldn't manage farm machinery. The women residents helped in the kitchen, setting the tables or peeling potatoes. During the day they would sew."" Campbell also remembered that Platt Road used to be known as ""Pauper's Alley"" and that ""Poor House residents used to sneak away and, using a little money they might have gotten from relatives, buy some tobacco at McMillan's store on Packard, where the Sunoco station is now.""
Poor houses are usually depicted as bleak, terrible places, but Ann Arborites old enough to remember believe this one was not such a bad place. According to lifelong Ann Arbor resident Arthur Rieff, ""it was a lot nicer than old age homes are today. Those who could work, did, and there was a nice visiting room. No one minded going there to live."" Edith Staebler Kempf agrees it was a pleasant enough place, especially with all the home-grown food, but says there was enough of a social stigma in being there that she was taught in her childhood to refer to it not as the ""poor farm"" but as the ""county home."" She adds, ""People of means were ostracized if they let their relatives live there.""
After the welfare system arose in the 1930s, the farm changed from a home for poor people to a place for people who needed continual medical care but could not afford it. The farm lands were rented to Ralph McCalla, who continued raising cattle and growing crops until 1960. According to McCalla, ""Some of the Poor House residents still helped. They would come down to the barn and feed the livestock just to have something to do.""
The County Infirmary, as it was known after 1917, was closed in 1971 after county officials decided it would cost too much to modernize. It was torn down in 1979. For a time, St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital seriously considered building on the site, and doctors' offices were built on the eastern side of Platt in anticipation of this move. After St. Joe's decided to locate elsewhere, debate centered on whether the land should be used for new county buildings or for a park.
After the county commissioners decided to keep the county courthouse in downtown Ann Arbor, the County Parks and Recreation Department went to work creating the County Farm Park. Today the 127-acre park includes a parcours (a jogging-exercise trail patterned after European fitness courses), a woodland trail, a perennial garden complete with native shrubs, Project Grow gardens, and an irrigation system powered by a windmill. All that remains of the poor farm is the barn now used to store maintenance equipment.",1971,"Ann Arbor, MI",,
Michigan,Eloise Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wayne_County_Poor_House,1839,,1841,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Wayne County Poorhouse | Eloise Hospital | Wayne County Asylum | Wayne County Psychiatric Hospital,"In 1839, only two years after Michigan had joined the Union, Wayne County paid $800 to buy a 160-acre farm in Nankin Township (now Westland). The purchase included a log cabin known as the Black Horse Tavern. The County erected an addition to the tavern building and used it to house 35 needy people, a keeper and his wife. They called it the Wayne County Poorhouse. Its first residents were transferred from another poorhouse at Gratiot and Mt. Elliott in Detroit . Many refused to move, claiming the new poorhouse was ""too far out in the wilderness."" And they were right -- at that time the corner of Michigan and Merriman was nearly two days by stage coach from Detroit.
But that was what the county officials had in mind. They wanted somewhere well out of sight to send what they saw as society's dregs -- the vagrants, vagabonds, drunkards, pilferers and brawlers. With such a broad charter, it wasn't long before the feeble-minded and the insane were being housed there. Records show that a Biddy Hughes was Eloise's first official mental patient, committed by her family in 1841. She was in her mid-30s when admitted and was kept there until her death 58 years later.
Prior to the 1840s, little distinction was made between rational and mentally ill inmates. A county report from the 1840s made reference to harsh restraints used to separate the mentally ill from other inmates. The mentally ill were housed on the upper floor of a farm building used to keep pigs.
County employee Stanislas M. Keenan reported in his 1913 book, ""The History of Eloise,"" that in the first few years people in the surrounding area heard ""the chained unfortunates roaring and shrieking in discord with the squealing pigs beneath."" Conditions improved in 1869 when the mentally ill were moved to a new building where they were supervised by a neighboring farmer and his wife. But the chains remained until 1881, when Dr. E.O. Bennett, Eloise's first medical superintendent, did away with them.
In 1894 the Wayne County Poorhouse got a new name. Freeman B. Dickerson, president of the county board overseeing care of the poor, renamed the facility Eloise, after his 5-year-old daughter. The county eventually split the facility into the Eloise Infirmary for the Sick and Elderly and the Eloise Hospital for the Insane.
In 1903, after a sharp increase in tuberculosis cases, it was recommended that these patients be separated from the general hospital population. A canvass hospital was erected consisting of two tents -- one for males and one for females. As the number of TB patients increased Eloise Sanitarium was built. In a report to the auditors in 1911, a Dr. Dutlitz says, ""The erection of this hospital was an answer to the public call."" He said physicians were practically unanimous in recommending open air treatment for tuberculosis of the lungs.
The patients at Eloise posed a special problem, however. By the time they got to Eloise they were in the final stages of the disease. They were sent there from other treatment centers when their personal funds were exhausted, leaving them candidates for the poorhouse. Eloise continued to operate what was essentially a TB hospital for indigents until 1923, when the State and City of Detroit began providing facilities.
In the 1930's Wayne County began feeling the effects of the Depression. Eloise grew rapidly as both the indigent and mentally ill populations multiplied. In 1932, a barracks was erected to house unemployed men. By 1934 the inmate population averaged more than 8,300, about 50 percent of them mentally ill, and the number of employees had risen to nearly 2,000. For residents, boredom was a major problem. A 1939 Detroit News article described the daily routine: ""The residents rise at 7 a.m. and go to bed at 7:30 p.m. Between times, they sit and stare at the wall, at their feet, at the windows. There is no exercise or organized social movement."" Some inmates received passes to leave the grounds where they became easy targets for policemen, who arrested and fined them for petty crimes. Most found the outside world difficult to cope with. Many spent their leaves at local bars and ended up in jail. Others walked the surrounding neighborhoods aimlessly..
Eloise grew into a city unto itself. Its 78 buildings included a fire department, 15-man police force, powerhouses, a cannery, bakery and fruit cellar, a sewage disposal plant a morgue, laundry facilities; a library and low-rent employee lodgings. Nearly 20 percent of the staff lived on the grounds.
In 1945, Eloise was renamed Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary. The new name was intended to reflect the modern ""scientific"" approaches to caring for the poor and mentally ill that had been instituted at the facility. Most, however, continued to refer to the facility as Eloise.
By the 1950's Wayne County General was considered one of the best hospitals in the nation. It played a major part in metro Detroit's health network. It was the only acute-care medical and surgical hospital between Detroit and Ypsilanti. Needy patients would have died without Wayne County General. A reporter who toured the facility in 1953 was moved by the ""pitiful cases"" -- ""the senile, the spastics, the polio victims and those with advanced multiple sclerosis.""  By the '50s, patients were benefiting from insulin and electric shock therapy, psychotherapy by psychiatrists and occupational and recreational therapy. Occupational therapy included farming, sewing, work in the hospital laundry and maintenance departments. Recreational therapy included classes in handiwork and a special division of music therapy.
Throughout its boom years, when the complex was caring for as many as 10,000 patients daily, the facility was plagued by reports of patient beatings, employee theft, mismanagement, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding. At one time 3,800 mental patients -- including 300 with tuberculosis -- were crammed into quarters designed for 2,500. As many as 125 women had to share five toilets.
By 1955 money problems had become acute. George E. Gullen Jr., chairman of the Wayne County chapter of the Michigan Society of Mental Health, figured that on a per patient basis, Wayne General was ""the most expensive mental hospital in the world."" The county continually sought ways to cut costs. One auditor questioned the practice of buying false teeth at $100 a set for indigent TB patients, after noting that $6,500 had been spent on dentures in one six-month period.
Not all was bleak at Eloise. A carnival was held each summer on the hospital grounds with booths built by patients. Patients also ran a coffee shop in the psychiatric building. ""They must face life and its stresses and we want them ready to do that,"" explained one of the doctors. Proceeds were used to buy recreational supplies.
By 1960 new theories for treatment of the mentally ill were developing, and Eloise kept in step. The goal was no longer to provide long term care, but to return patients to society as soon as possible. Most were kept less than 90 days and in 1964 only one in ten became permanent residents -- compared to nearly 50 percent previously. This success added to Eloise's money problems. The state chipped in for psychiatric expenses only after patients had been hospitalized for a year.
Wayne County also began ""mainstreaming"" -- getting the psychiatric patient back into the community each week. This sometimes caused problems. One patient was so excited about his weekend leave that he stole a car from the hospital parking lot. There was a high speed chase in which he was involved in five collisions and ran two police blockades. During the chase shots were fired, nearly missing a group of children at a school crossing. The inmate was taken into custody after running the car into a ditch.
As patient treatment was updated , so were the facilities. Older buildings were razed in the '60s and '70s and two new buildings were constructed -- a 511-bed medical hospital in 1962 and a long term care facility in 1974. The Walter Reuther Long Term Care Facility housed the surviving mentally ill and poor who had made Eloise their permanent home.
By 1987, six years after the facility's closing, Eloise had been reduced to eight buildings. Today, only a 5 buildings remain and all are empty. The county is currently working on a plan to redevelop the complex. The ""D"" building houses some Wayne County of [1]In November 2015, the Detroit Free Press reported that the 50-acre complex was put on sale for $1.5 million – which includes an fire station from the 1800s, a decommissioned power plant and two maintenance buildings. On March 29th, 2016 the former bakery building built in 1905, one of the last original buildings, was the victim of arson. The damage was enough to have the structure demolished. Morgan Development purchased the property in June of 2018.

Michigan,Battle Creek Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Battle_Creek_Sanitarium,,,1866,Preserved,Single Building,"Frank Andrews, Merritt J. Morehouse",Western Health Reform Institute | Percy Jones Army Hospital | Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center,"It started in 1854 when the Adventist Church was established in Battle Creek. In 1860, the denominational name was changed to Seventh-day Adventist (SDA): “Seventh Day,” because their Sabbath is on Saturday, the seventh day of the week; and “Adventist,” because they were remnants of the Millerite movement that erroneously predicted the advent of the Second Coming of Christ in 1844. The denomination believes in sanctity of body and soul, and advocates temperance and preventive medicine as a way of life. To support this belief, the Adventists opened their first health retreat, the Western Health Reform Institute, in 1866.
Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (1852-1943) took charge of the Institute for the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1876 and changed the name to the Battle Creek Sanitarium. He came up with the word “sanitarium” to reflect his idea of a sanitary retreat for health restoration and training (“a place where people learn to stay well”) rather than “sanitorium,” which meant a hospital for invalids or for treatment of tuberculosis. The San, as the place was familiarly known, prospered under Dr. Kellogg’s direction. The original building was expanded and a new structure (“Old Main”) was completed in April 1878.
Dr. Kellogg’s medical treatment embraced all branches of medicine, including surgery, but with emphasis on fresh air, sunshine, exercise, rest and diet. The SDA dietary practices eliminated meats, condiments, spices, alcohol, chocolate, coffee and tea. Nutritious substitutes were created for “harmful” foods. Dr. Kellogg invented some 80 grain and nut products. He originated peanut butter in 1893 by grinding cooked peanuts in the kitchens at the San. He manufactured the first Battle Creek health food, granola (an ancestor of Grape-Nuts) in 1878. A “Caramel Cereal” coffee substitute beverage (an ancestor of Postum) was developed as a suitable drink for use at the San in 1876.
In 1880, Dr. Kellogg hired his brother, Will Keith (W.K.) Kellogg (1860-1951), as the San’s bookkeeper and business manager. Among his various duties, W.K. Kellogg assisted his brother in food experiments.
The national and international reputation of the San continued to grow, as did that of the extroverted little (about 5 feet 4 inches tall) doctor, J. H. Kellogg, who later in life wore completely white outfits (shoes, socks, suit, shirt, tie, hat, coat, galoshes) that, later in life, accentuated his white hair, mustache and goatee. In contrast, W. K. Kellogg was taller (5 feet 7½ inches), heavier, bald, unsmiling and introverted. W.K. inconspicuously served his brother for 26 years at the San.
The famous doctor was absorbed with running “his spa.” He spent his time editing magazines, authoring and publishing books, traveling, inventing medical equipment, creating health foods, lecturing, administering his Battle Creek College, operating his numerous business enterprises and performing as a highly skilled physician and surgeon.
W. K. Kellogg is said to have developed the first edible corn flake product, working after his normal hours as business manager, in the food laboratory at the Sanitarium. Accounts vary, so both Kellogg brothers may have been involved in the discovery. Probably the most significant food products developed at the San by the Kellogg brothers were flaked cereals: Granose, the first wheat flake (1895), and Sanitas Corn Flakes, the first corn flake (1898).
The discovery and development of the grain flaking process by the Kellogg brothers is an interesting story in itself. The first toasted and ready-to-eat cereals were produced in a dry and crisp, ready-to-be-eaten form, without addition of sugar or milk. It was W. K. Kellogg who saw the potential of combining the cereal with milk for a quick, nutritious breakfast alternative. He was also a pioneer in mass marketing of the product to the public.
The discovery of flaked cereals spurred more than 100 companies to locate in Battle Creek in order to copy the Kelloggs’ process. In 1891, Charles William (C.W.) Post relocated in Battle Creek suffering from nervous exhaustion. He entered the San as a patient, and while there became interested in developing his own line of products. After leaving the San, he introduced Postum Cereal Coffee (1895), Grape-Nuts? (1898) and Post Toasties (1906) from his own manufacturing plants (now the Post Division of Kraft foods) in Battle Creek.
Things were going along well at the San, with major structural expansions being made. Then, a disastrous fire destroyed the San on Feb. 18, 1902. Dr. Kellogg, with the help of W. K. Kellogg’s business and financial skills, immediately started a new structure, which was completed on the same site and dedicated May 31, 1903. The 550-foot-long six-story portion of the building that faces Washington Avenue was built for about $700,000 to $1 million, according to differing reports. Prominent architects called the building an “ideal hospital design.” The 1903 San was Italian Renaissance in style, with nearly seven acres of indoor space, and “fireproof.” For further insurance, property was donated to the city to build a brand new fire station directly across from the new facility.
Inside, beauty prevailed and elegance was apparent. Some of the most noticeable features included a spacious central Grand Lobby with an ornamented ceiling and several large, leaded-glass windows. It also had a solarium; a large chapel; parlor; J.H. Kellogg-designed posture chairs throughout; 40 to 60 staff doctors’ offices on the first floor; patients’ rooms on the second, third, fourth and fifth floors. On the top floor were modern kitchens and a grand banquet hall (Dining Room in the Trees), with hand-painted ceiling murals and beautiful views of the countryside or downtown Battle Creek from every window.
Directly through the central grand lobby, to the rear of the main building, was a glass-domed, 60-by-40-foot, semi-circular palm garden, which displayed a rockery, fountain waterfall, fish pond, exotic tropical plants, palm trees, a 20-foot fruit-bearing banana tree, citrus trees and a spectacular rubber tree that reached to the ceiling.
General prosperity prevailed throughout the United States during the 1920s. That, plus increasing popularity and financial success, caused the San’s Board of Directors to urge a San expansion program onto the nearly 80-year-old Dr. Kellogg. In 1928, a connected, yellow-brick, sculptured concrete and copper trimmed, 15-story “Towers” addition (facing Champion Street) and a four-level dining room were completed at a cost of more than $3 million (excluding furnishings).
The “Towers” addition made it the highest building in Battle Creek, containing more than 265 hotel-like guest rooms and suites, a majority of which had private bathrooms, a convenience not common in hospitals at the time.
In addition, the “Towers” had many plush interior features. The first, and most conspicuous feature, was the luxurious, spacious, two-floor-high open main lobby with its 12 massive domestic “Mankato” marble columns, with imported Italian marble bases, topped with golden Corinthian capitals that supported a deeply sculptured, intricately decorated, Florentine ceiling. Two huge, gold and mirrored chandeliers and eight rose-glass and gold auxiliary light fixtures illuminated the lobby with soft light. The lobby walls were of the finest, delicately grained, pink-gold marble with inlaid black-white marble margins, the same as that used for the columns.
This beautiful main lobby was completely surrounded by a wide, thickly carpeted mezzanine with recessed, hand-carved marble drinking fountains in the walls. At each end was a carved marble arch and clock bezel over both the right and left halls. Originally, well-appointed but separate men’s and women’s parlors were located at either end of the main lobby near the clock arches.
There were exquisite draperies on the lobby and parlor windows and fine oriental rugs on the polished, beige marble terrazzo lobby floor.
The exterior of the towers building remains practically unchanged, and the main lobby is today known as the Champion Street entrance.
The dining room was topped by a 15,000-square foot, red-tiled, outdoor “Sun Garden” promenade deck for exercise formations and social gatherings. In addition, there were indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts; a separate Union Building with a large recreation center and gymnasium used for exercises, square dancing and games, with bowling alleys and a billiard room; a Creamery Building for processing milk products; a huge laundry (the largest in Michigan at that time); a modernized power and heating plant; and its own private water wells with a pumping and water softening plant. Not far away (in what is today the Lakeview area of Battle Creek), the San operated its own farms, greenhouses, vegetable gardens, orchards and dairy barns.
The originally ascetic San had become quite plush. Operating at the height of its fame, it accommodated more than 1,250 patients with a staff of 1,800 at any one time in both buildings. More than 400,000 guests from all parts of the world visited the San. Many guests were famous. President William Howard Taft was the 100,000 guest to be registered. Although he had visited the San many times before, Henry Ford was the first guest to be registered in the Towers building. Other guests included Eleanor Roosevelt, J.C. Penney, S.S. Kresge and Amelia Earhart. The San was prosperous when the building program was completed, but economic and social changes were on America’s horizon.
By 1933, the San went into receivership and Dr. Kellogg’s role was diminished by the San’s new board of directors. Yet, Dr. Kellogg and his San continued to be recognized around the world. In February 1942, Dr. Kellogg was honored by 3,000 local citizens as the governor declared February 26th “John Harvey Kellogg Day” in Michigan. The buildings were sold to the U.S. Army later that year and the San moved to the nearby Fieldstone Building. Dr. Kellogg died the following year on Dec.14, 1943, at the age of 91. The San operation gradually declined, returning to Seventh-day Adventist control in 1974. It became part of the Battle Creek Health System in 1993.
The Army purchased the Sanitarium in August 1942 for $2.5 million. It was at that time a 1,000-bed hospital. Capacity of the facility was enlarged to 1,500 beds and in January 1943, the first combat casualties began arriving in Battle Creek via the Grand Trunk and Michigan Central Railroads, on United States Army hospital trains.
The first commander was Colonel Norman T. Kirk, the former chief of surgical services at Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, D.C. Kirk named the new hospital after Colonel Percy Lancelot Jones, USA, who had been an Army surgeon in the Spanish-American? War, the Mexican Campaign and World War I. Jones was a pioneer of modern battlefield ambulance evacuation and commanded the ambulance service which was detached from the Allied Expeditionary Forces to the French Army during World War I. Jones was decorated by America and France after the war for organizing what was called the finest mobile medical treatment in military history. Jones and his ambulance service were instrumental in creating the U.S. Army Ambulance Corps. He retired from the Army in 1931, was superintendent of Hamon Hospital in Erie, Pa., and died in 1941.
Kirk had served under Jones in 1913, and the two remained friends afterward. Percy Jones Hospital was officially dedicated on Feb. 22, 1943. Attending the ceremony were the Surgeon General of the Army, Major General James Magee, Michigan Governor Harry R. Kelly, and the widow and daughter of Colonel Jones. Kirk left Percy Jones in May 1943 as a brigadier general and was named Surgeon General of the Army.
The hospital grew as the flow of casualties increased. In 1944, W.K. Kellogg donated his mansion on nearby Gull Lake to the Army, which assigned it to Percy Jones as a convalescent center. The Fort Custer Reception Center was also taken over by Percy Jones for use by patients on “casual duty.”
In 1945, Percy Jones became the largest U.S. Army medical installation. Following V-J Day (victory over Japan) in 1945, the hospital population peaked with 11,427 patients assigned to its three area sites. Percy Jones specialized as an Army center for neurosurgery, amputations and handicapped rehabilitation, deep x-ray therapy and plastic artificial eyes. In one month alone, 729 operations were performed.
V-J Day did not mark the end of “war work” at Percy Jones, although the number of patients decreased. In 1948, there were about 50 patients hospitalized with war wounds, as well as about 1,000 with peacetime injuries. After a short deactivation period, the hospital reopened only a few days after hostilities broke out in Korea in the summer of 1950. In 1951, about 1,000 patients were at Percy Jones, many of them with frostbite caused by the bone-chilling Korean weather.
It’s hard to overstate the historical, social and economic significance of Percy Jones to Battle Creek, its host community. Battle Creek became the first city in America to install wheel chair ramps in its sidewalks because of the number of Percy Jones patients who wanted to go downtown. Many citizens volunteered at the hospital. Some volunteers found romance, which led to marriages and new families in the community.
In fact, as of 2003, several persons who had been born at the Percy Jones Hospital were members of the Federal Center workforce.
The Hospital complex functioned like a city within itself. It had its own water supply, electrical facility, bank, post office, radio station (“KPJ”) and Percy Jones Institute, an accredited high school with more than 20 schools for various subjects ranging from business to agriculture. A single day could bring more than 2,000 visitors.
There were stories of extraordinary care, cures and rehabilitation of soldiers who arrived with little hope at the hospital. In November 1953, Percy Jones Hospital closed for the last time. It had treated more than 78,000 patients during World War II and 16,500 during the Korean War. Each Percy Jones patient was special, and the impact of their lives on the future is beyond measure. Amid the thousands of everyday heroes were many who went on to successful careers in business and government, including U.S. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, former presidential candidate and retired U.S. Sen. Robert (Bob) J. Dole of Kansas and the late U.S. Sen. Philip A. Hart of Michigan. In honor of these individuals, on May 31, 2003, the Federal Center held an official ceremony recognizing the name change to the Hart-Dole-Inouye? Federal Center as part of its Centennial celebration.
While at Percy Jones Hospital, all three men showed great personal courage and determination in recuperating from their wounds and subsequently focused their energy to distinguish themselves with outstanding public service. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, who first served in Congress from 1959 to 1962, was elected in 1962 to the United States Senate, where he has served continuously for more than 40 years. The late Sen. Philip A. Hart rose from local and state government to his election to the U.S. Senate in 1958, where he served for 18 years. He died just a few weeks short of completing his third term in December 1976.
Years later, in the 1990s, Sen. Dole wrote the following letter, which was printed in the Battle Creek Enquirer newspaper, praising the Percy Jones Hospital staff and Battle Creek community for the medical care and support, enabling him and thousands of other patients to literally take a step forward and build new lives.
While the closing of Percy Jones created a void in Battle Creek, it would soon be filled with the national offices of the Federal Civil Defense Administration along with Staff College of the National Civil Defense Training Center. In 1949, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) exploded an atomic bomb, and the Cold War began in earnest. Concerns over atomic warfare became widespread and led to the creation of the Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA) in 1950. The FCDA mission was to prepare America for the possibility of an “atomic attack.” The offices relocated to Battle Creek from Washington, D.C. in 1954.
Reporting directly to the Office of the President of the United States, the FCDA had top security status. As a result, little public record of a decade of work remains. During that time period, however, it is known that all civil defense materials were created in and distributed from Battle Creek. The Public Affairs Office and the briefing division had a staff of professional scriptwriters and nationally recognized radio announcers who lent immeasurable credibility to briefings and to the production of all materials.
The agency art department consisted of nine artists, two photographers and a professional display person. All the materials produced here and distributed nationally helped to organize medical and law enforcement units across America. These organizations were trained to respond to a potential nuclear attack, and how to coordinate services for natural disasters like tornadoes and floods. The Office of Civil Defense planned and coordinated volunteer technical services, public education, health and welfare service, fallout shelters, attack warnings and communications. The work started here in the 1950s proved to be so vital to the nation that it evolved into what we know today as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The agency is now part of the Department of Homeland Security.
The Civil Defense Staff College remained in the Federal Center after 1962. Between 1954 and 1968, more than 30,000 resident students attended the Staff College with many more attending extension courses given through 52 participating universities. Offering courses such as Civil Defense Management, Shelter Management, Radiological Defense and Civil Defense Adult Education, the Staff College remained until 1980 when it moved to Emmitsburg, Md.
Percy Jones and Civil Defense were each sole occupants of the Federal Center. In 1959, the General Services Administration (GSA), which had managed the buildings since 1954, began utilizing all the facility’s space by opening it to other federal organizations. To mark the new era, the name of the facility was changed to the Battle Creek Federal Center.
The Early Battle Creek Federal Center Years
Early tenants included the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Processed Products Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, and offices of the Social Security Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Post Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and a local congressman. By 1962, 28 different organizations were housed here, ranging in size from one to hundreds of employees.
Despite the smaller tenants, departure of the primary Civil Defense function in 1962 left a gap in Battle Creek. In 1963, the gap was filled when two organizations, the Sixth Corps of the U.S. Fifth Army and the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), were transferred to the Battle Creek Federal Center. In moving DLSC, Lt. Gen. Andrew McNamara? of the Defense Supply Agency anticipated the movement of personnel and computers to Battle Creek to be the answer to consolidating inventories and military stockpiles.
The primary mission of the Sixth Corps of the Fifth Army was to maintain military personnel records and to furnish supplies to reserve units and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) units in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. They also sent Inspector General teams from Battle Creek to reserve units in their territory.
DLSC traced its roots back to the World War I era. The Naval Depot Supply and Stock Catalog was established in 1914 in order to have a standardized catalog of items used by the Navy. After World War II, the Army-Navy? Munitions Board created a single Department of Defense (DoD) catalog system called the Joint Army-Navy? Catalog System. It was a problem during World War II when each service maintained a separate supply system with its own catalog of items. Many items were given a different name by each service, making efficient use of available stock impossible.
The first federal stock number was assigned by Munitions Board personnel in 1949. In 1952, the Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act became the key legislation to create a single catalog system for DoD. In 1958, the Armed Forces Supply Support Center (AFSSC) was established in Washington, D.C., to maintain the Federal Catalog System and standardize item names used by the military services. When the Defense Supply Agency (now the Defense Logistics Agency) was created in 1961, AFSSC was assigned to DSA, was renamed the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) and was eventually relocated to Battle Creek in 1963.
Aside from DLSC’s original mission of developing and maintaining the Federal Catalog System, it was assigned the additional task of managing the Department of Defense surplus sales and reutilization and recycling programs.
In 1971, a congressional commission recommended that all aspects of DoD property disposal should be centralized in order to improve accountability. The Defense Property Disposal Service (DPDS) was created in September 1972, assuming the surplus sales and utilization missions from DLSC. DPDS also managed more than 300 U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force property disposal offices at installations around the world. As its mission expanded to include the Precious Metals Recovery Program, the proper disposal of hazardous property and the Resource Recovery and Recycling Program, DPDS was renamed the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) in 1985.
In 1976, the Air Force Logistics Command consolidated all its cataloging and standardization functions into one office. The Cataloging and Standardization Office (CASO) was upgraded to an Air Force Logistics Center (CASC) in 1983.
In 1998, five months after DLSC was renamed Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), CASC was deactivated and its cataloging mission was transferred to DLIS.
The name change to DLIS reflected the command’s increased use of information technology to help customers manage their logistics needs.
Other changes at DLIS included incorporation of military cataloging operations, previously performed by each service, into the command’s operations. The consolidation was completed by early 2000.
The Hart-Dole-Inouye? Federal Center Today
Now, in the 21st Century, the Federal Center houses approximately 1,600 federal employees and 200 contractors, who provide services and products ranging from sophisticated logistics information for U.S. and NATO military forces to cost-effective, environmentally compliant disposal solutions for U.S. military units worldwide.
Defense Logistics Information Service
The Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) is the largest operational unit within today’s Hart-Dole-Inouye? Federal Center, with about 1,000 employees.
DLIS employees manage logistics information for supply items used by the U.S. government, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other foreign governments.
DLIS administers the Federal Catalog System, a single cataloging system with a uniform identification for all military supplies, providing economical, efficient and effective supply management. It gathers, creates, processes, distributes and manages logistics information for six and a half million supply items, ranging from missiles and space vehicles to washers and screws.
Another DLIS mission is the maintenance of the Military Engineering Data Asset Locator System (MEDALS). MEDALS provides the ability to search for the location of technical data management community. MEDALS contains location information for over 25 million data assets.
DLIS offers training on all its products and services, including platform (classroom) instruction. In addition, DLIS now features “Distributed Learning” such as computer, web- based and satellite broadcast training. Learning opportunities are provided around the world, as well as at the Federal Center, and are available to Defense and civil agencies, participating foreign governments and the private sector.
Internationally, DLIS supports goals for NATO and other governments. At home and abroad, DLIS products and services help American military men and women get the supplies and equipment they need. Providing help and information to customers is DLIS’ top priority. The Battle Creek Customer Contact Center answers thousands of questions annually about DLIS products and services. (Visit the DLIS Web Site: www.dlis.dla.mil or call the Customer Contact Center at 1-877-352-2255 for more information on DLIS.)
Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service
DRMS employs about 350 people at its headquarters in the Federal Center and another 1,200 in 39 states and 13 foreign countries. DRMS is responsible for the disposal of excess property generated by the military services. The inventory changes daily and includes thousands of items from tools to vehicles and clothing to computers. Property is first offered for reuse within DoD, then transferred to other federal agencies or donated to state and local governments and other qualified organizations. Increasingly, the DRMS mission is being carried out, streamlined, made more efficient and timely by direct contact and sales over the Internet through a Commercial Venture partnership.
Field offices, called Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMOs), are located on or near U.S. military installations worldwide. It is at the DRMOs that the day-to-day mission of DRMS is carried out. Each workday, DoD activities turn in thousands of excess equipment items to DRMOs. The DRMS Reutilization Program is an excellent source of supply for both DoD mission-essential and support items. DRMS also supports the State Department’s Humanitarian Assistance and Foreign Military Sales programs.
The DRMS Demilitarization Program ensures that material with inherent military characteristics is rendered useless for its intended purpose before or as a condition of sale, turning offensive battlefield equipment into harmless scrap. DRMS also manages the disposal of hazardous property for DoD worldwide, keeping the environment in mind. It offers the property for reuse; what is not reused is made available for sale through commercial disposal contracts. This maximizes the use of each item and minimizes the environmental risk and cost associated with disposal. Tightly controlled disposal actions ensure hazardous property is handled, transported and disposed of in an environmentally safe and compliant manner.
The DRMS Resource, Recovery and Recycling Program conserves natural resources, reduces waste products and returns revenue to the military services. This program encourages DoD activities to identify and segregate marketable recyclable materials.
The DRMS Precious Metals Recovery Program contracts for recovery of electronic parts that contain gold, silver or platinum and platinum family metals. This significantly reduces DoD’s? need to purchase them, saving taxpayers an average of $10 million a year. (Visit the DRMS Web Site: www.drms.dla.mil or call the Battle Creek Customer Contact Center at 1-877-352-2255 for more information on DRMS.)
Federal Center is Home to Other Organizations
In addition to the Defense Logistics Information Service and the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, the Hart-Dole-Inouye? Federal Center is home to more than 20 other organizations. Both government and non-government organizations support the federal activities and their employees, and cover a unique spectrum.
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Systems Integration Office, Logistics Systems Business Support Unit (DSIO-J), was established in 1983 to develop automated information systems for the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS). Its Federal Center employees assisted in development of a modern computer network with an integrated database. Today, DSIO-J employees support the automated information systems for both DLIS and DRMS. DSIO headquarters, located in Columbus, Ohio, manages and maintains all the
HQ Air Force Materiel Command/Logistics Information Support Office (AFMC/LGIS) supports the U.S. Air Force fleet of aircraft by ensuring parts and information are available through data systems for all airmen who maintain, support and fly U.S. Air Force aircraft.
The General Services Administration (GSA) manages and maintains the Federal Center, keeping this historic 21-building complex in good condition.
The Federal Protective Service (FPS), a part of the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement provides law enforcement and overall security for the Federal Center, including screening of employees and visitors as well as patrolling the Center 24 hours a day.
Printing services for the Defense Department activities are supported by the employees of the Defense Automated Printing Service. The Battle Creek office supports DLIS, DRMS and DSIO-J.
Peckham, Inc., is a private contractor and performs many services for Federal Center tenants. Its employees provide photographic and audiovisual services, graphics, mail room operation, receiving, distribution of forms and publications, furniture moves, room set-ups, motor pool and supplies.
The U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters at the Federal Center oversees and supports recruiting offices throughout southwest Michigan.
The Federal Center also houses other offices that serve DLIS, DRMS, DSIO-J and others in the building. They are: Occupational Health Nurses, Public Affairs, Federal Center Library, Security, Equal Employment Opportunity, Legal, DLA Training Center, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 1626 and Emergency Services.
The Quality of Life (QOL) Program benefits all Federal Center employees. Under the QOL program, there are five offices: the Family Advocacy Program; the Information, Ticketing and Registration (ITR) Office; the Relocation Office; the Fitness Center; and the Recreation Department.
We’re Part Of The Community
Community support is important at the Federal Center. Our Red Cross blood drive averages more than 1,000 pints of blood per year. We contribute more than $120,000 a year to local and national charities through the Combined Federal Campaign. Support also includes the Salvation Army’s Adopt-a-Family?, Adopt-a-School?, World’s Longest Breakfast Table and Cereal City Corporate Cup. Employees contribute thousands of hours a year to community and charitable activities.
A Unique Historical Resource
The historical significance of the Federal Center has been officially recognized. In 1976, Building 2 (the six-story section dedicated in 1903) was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Finally, in 1989, Buildings 1 and 1A (the towers addition) joined Building 2 on the City of Battle Creek and State of Michigan Registers of Historic Places. A historic marker was installed at the corner of Champion Street and Washington Avenue in May 1990.
Symbolic of the historic renaissance of the Battle Creek Federal Center was the discovery and restoration of the Italian Fountain. When the new dining room opened in 1928, it was graced with a 17-foot-tall marble and walnut fountain. The fountain was sold at a public sale when Percy Jones was remodeled in 1950. It was lost until 1985, when members of the Historical Society of Battle Creek found it listed in an estate sale in Grand Rapids, Mich. It was purchased by the society and restored by a committee of Federal Center employees.
In April 1997, a three-year $25 million renovation of the Federal Center was completed. Major improvements to the 480,000 square-foot building included fire safety upgrades, a new heating-ventilation air conditioning system, new electrical work, removal of asbestos, enhanced telecommunications and power supplies, installation of sprinkler systems, new roofing and improvements to the building’s mechanical infrastructure.
While strict security is observed at all times at the Federal Center because of its important military role, the building is not secluded from the community, nor is it reserved for federal workers alone. Weekday tours are given by appointment only — call the Public Affairs Office at (269) 961-7015. All visitors’ names are required in advance and a photo ID for each is needed the day of the tour. Seventh-day Adventists come from throughout America and other countries to see this part of their church’s heritage.
World War II veterans are frequent visitors, and have held conventions to remember Percy Jones Hospital. The large dining room is available for use by the Battle Creek community for high school proms, community concerts and nonprofit organizational banquets.
Whether a Sanitarium, an Army hospital or a federal center, these buildings have remained a landmark and source of pride to the community and the people who work within its walls. As the late “official” Federal Center historian, John Buchmeier was fond of saying, “It is not an ordinary federal government building like a post office or courthouse - - it is historically unique and a most interesting place.”

Created in 1911 by Dr. Ed Ford as a sanatorium and hospital on the shore of Trout Lake, Birch Lodge Hospital and Summer Resort Sanitarium never really saw much use for its intended purpose.  Finished sometime in 1911-1912 Dr. Ed Ford died of rabies acquired from being bitten by an infected dog before the hospital could fully get off the ground.  Ford's family attempted to continue his work for a few years, but by 1915 decided to sell the property and building the mortgage holder due to low occupancy.  From this point on the facility spent most of it's life as a Hotel and Lodge, though local history suggests it was used as the home of the forerunner to the state police for a short time around 1918.
The house is currently listed on the Michigan Historic register and in the process of being refurbished as a bed and breakfast.

Michigan,Herman Kiefer Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Herman_Kiefer_Hospital,1905,1905,1911,Active,Single Building,,Herman Kiefer Hospital Historic District | Rehabilitation Institute of Metropolitan Detroit | Metropolitan Detroit Polio Foundation,"The Herman Keifer Hospital was a clinic designed to serve patients with ""consumption"" in the greater Detroit area.  Named for the father of Dr. Guy Lincoln Kiefer, one of the staunchest advocates for increased medical care for people with what would later become known as Polio, Tuberculosis, Typhoid, and other illnesses, the Herman Kiefer Hospital was finally completed in 1911.  The Senior Dr Keifer was a member of many medical boards, educational societies, a member of the underground railroad, and instrumental in the education of his son, who would go on to found this hospital in his name.  Dr. Guy L. Kiefer began petitioning for the hospital in 1905, with work started, but quickly expanding need and legal objections from the community surrounding the suggested cite lead to the relocation of where the hospital would be created.
In 1908 the first Tuberculosis patient was admitted to the temporary facilities built on the grounds of what would become the hospital. Most of the prior cases seen at the facility were patients with Polio or people suffering from other communicable diseases.  The early patients seen were to be held for 2 months to teach them to ""prevent rather than cure"" the spread of disease in the community.
Due to his efforts attempts were made to name the hospital after Guy Keifer, but he petitioned to have the hospital named after his father and instead received the first degree of ""Doctor of Public Health"" from the University of Michigan.
Due to burgeoning need expansions were made several times, with the final facilities consisting of approximately 7 pavilion style buildings, a powerhouse, an Administration building and a Main medical building known as the Taylor Avenue Unit.
Architects of the structures are as follows:
Pavilions 1 & 2 (the contagious disease hospital; 1909-1911), the Administration building in 1909 (with expansion for power plant in 1918) and Pavilion 4 were designed by architect George Mason.  The Power House (1922), and pavilions 6 and 7 (1919) were designed by architect Albert Kahn.  The final addition during this period was the Main Taylor Avenue Unit done by Architect Albert Kahn and with the help of the W. E. Wood Contracting Co. contracting for the work.  Later additions for this building were done by H. E. Beyster and Associates Architecture Co and O. W. Burke Co.  contracting the work in 1953.
Pavilions 3, 4, 5, and the Nurses building were built in 1913, but demolished before the application for a historic site was completed and there was no date of demolition listed.  Several other outlying non-permanent buildings were also used at various times for patients with diphtheria, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and other medical conditions that needed to be separated and quarantined to prevent the spread of their infectious conditions.  Polio was also a common infectious disease for which patients were referred to the hospital and Iron Lungs were added to the facility for the treatment of the condition in 1958.  Existing facilities for the treatment of smallpox on the grounds of the hospital were also incorporated into the facility.
The site was still partially active and housed the Wayne County Dept. of Health along with some other offices.  Throughout the life of the hospital several other organizations and committees used the facility.  Most notable were Rehabilitation Institute of Metropolitan Detroit and the Metropolitan Detroit Polio Foundation.  These two groups merged in 1953 and moved to a newly built hospital separate from the Herman Kiefer Hospital in 1958.

Michigan,Ingham County Tuberculosis Sanitorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ingham_County_Tuberculosis_Sanitorium,,,1913,Demolished,Single Building,,Ingham Sanatorium | Ingham Chest Hospital,"Ingham Medical Center’s roots date back to 1913 when it was founded as a 10-bed tuberculosis sanitorium.  Opened two years later as the Ingham County Tuberculosis Sanitorium and staffed by three employees, the hospital rapidly expanded to meet the area’s growing health care needs. A 30-bed infirmary was built in 1924, and, six years later, a four-story brick building was constructed to accommodate 100 patients.  By the late 1930s, the sanitorium was established as the chest surgical center for central and northern Michigan and as the tuberculosis facility for much of the state.
On Jan. 1, 1954, the name was changed to Ingham Chest Hospital, and a $600,000 expansion added private patient rooms, a surgical suite and administrative space.  Tuberculosis cases decreased sharply as the decade moved on, and in 1958, with the disease finally under control, the hospital converted its beds to general usage.  In 1960, the 170-bed hospital was renamed Ingham Medical Hospital.",1961,"Lansing, MI",,
Michigan,Jackson County Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jackson_County_Sanatorium,1918,,1928,Preserved,Single Building,,Northlawn Hospital,"There wasn't much for tuberculosis patients a century ago. Some stayed at home until they died or got better; others went to sanatoriums.
In 1928, Jackson County opened the Tuberculosis Hospital, a two-story, brick building on Erie Street off Lansing Avenue. The county's death rate at the time was 43.5 per 100,000 residents. The first building proved inadequate. Fresh air was considered a necessity, and one side had no windows.
County voters had approved $75,000 in 1918 for a new contagious-disease hospital. Four thousand dollars were spent in preparation, but the final structure was never built.
In 1928, county supervisors agreed to put the leftover balance toward a new sanatorium after the state Legislature passed an act declaring tuberculosis a communicable disease. A county bond issue also passed that year, allowing construction of a $300,000, state-of-the-art facility.
The new sanatorium was intended for 54 patients. The third floor was reserved for advanced cases; the second floor held ambulatory patients. There were four, four-bed wards and six, two-bed rooms on that level. Screens provided the only privacy. This level also offered sitting rooms, open terraces and porches.
Sick children were nursed on the first floor. Nearby were the administrative offices and outpatient department. Two dining rooms also were located on ground level -- one for patients and the other for nurses. The basement housed recreation and occupational-therapy rooms, a kitchen and the heating plant.
On Jan. 6, 1931, 16 patients were moved from the old hospital to the new facility, located on the same grounds. The first year saw 110 people admitted. Twenty years later, the death rate was reduced to four per 100,000 residents.
It was later known as Northlawn Hospital and it closed in August 1971. The building currently holds state parole and Friend of the Court offices.",1971,"Jackson, MI",,

Michigan,Maybury Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Maybury_Sanitarium,1919,,,Demolished,Single Building,,Detroit Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium,"In 1919, the land now known as Maybury State Park held a tuberculosis sanitarium. Originally called the Detroit Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, the facility was later named for William H. Maybury who spearheaded its development and actually oversaw its construction. The sanitarium was a city within itself consisting of around 40 buildings and could generate power and grow most of its own food. It served as a quarantine and recovery center for people with tuberculosis. At that time, there was no cure for tuberculosis until many years later when the development of antibiotics brought real help to people with the disease. The sanitarium was closed in 1969 when there was no longer a need for it. Most of the buildings had been torn down by 1975 when the State of Michigan Department of natural resources (MDNR) stepped in and the land became known as Maybury State Park.",1969,"Northville, MI",,

Admission was not discriminatory. Some were paying patients, while others were guests of the state or county. Regardless of who paid the bill, admission in the beginning was $7 a week, according to hospital records.
The facility changed names and purposes over the years. It was originally built as the Michigan State Sanatorium at Howell for the treatment of tuberculosis. It later became Howell State Hospital when patients with developmental disabilities where treated there. It was renamed the Hillcrest Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities before it was closed. In Polk's Michigan State Gazetteer and Business Directory for 1921, it is listed as the ""State Sanitarium for Tuberculosis."" The Michigan State Gazette for February, 1907 notes that the ""State Sanitorium for Consumptives, located three and one half miles from Howell, has been connected up by the Livingston County Mutual Telephone Company....""
The sanatorium - ""The San"" as many former employees affectionately call it - was more than just a place were people came for treatment. It was a self-sufficient entity that aimed to meet the patients' and employees' every need with a working farm, apple orchard, convenience store, post office, water and heating plants and kitchen staff. The hospital, situated on the highest point in southeast Michigan, according to former employees and paperwork detailing the beginning years of the state's first tuberculosis sanatorium, offered patients a picturesque place to live. Dormitories also were set up for single employees, while married staffers were offered apartments - four per building.
Physician apartments were close to the hospital ""in case of emergencies,"" explains Detterbeck, a native of Switzerland. Since each of the physicians hired at the sanatorium were specialists in tuberculosis, it was common to have several countries represented. During Detterbeck's 25-year tenure, the countries of Thailand, Germany, Turkey and the United States were all represented at one time. After leaving the facility, many of them stayed in the area, opened practices, shared services and even helped some former patients become doctors.
The hospital was located on what is now High Hillcrest Drive, at approximately what is now 3125 High Hillcrest Drive. The lat-lon is 42.5872558, -83.9785627.
1890 - The Michigan State Board of Health begins to petition the state Legislature for money to create and support a Michigan State Sanatorium to care for patients suffering from tuberculosis.
1905 - State legislators approve $20,000 for land acquisition and one year of operating expenses.
1906 - Howell area site selected from more than 20 potential sites. The land was 1,100 feet above sea level, making it the highest point of the natural watershed in the Lower Peninsula.
1907 - The sanatorium opens Sept. 7 with the admittance of two patients.
1909-1930 - Construction continues as the hospital grows from a 16-bed facility to a 500-bed hospital, with children's cottages, employees' quarters, a laundry and more. The Michigan State Sanatorium became known as one of the most modern and up-to-date sanatoriums, drawing patients from all over the United States.
1952-1954 - New antibiotic drugs were coming to the market, resulting in a 70 percent drop in tuberculosis-related deaths at the local facility.
1958-1960 - The sanatorium begins to accept developmentally disabled patients.
1961 - The hospital was transferred to the Department of Mental Health and becomes known as Howell State Hospital.
1978 - The facility is renamed Hillcrest Regional Center for the Developmentally Disabled.
1982 - Hillcrest closes because the state cannot afford to maintain the facility.
1985 - Buildings on the former Hillcrest Regional Center property are demolished following years of disuse.

The named changed in 1972 to the Alpine Center. In 1981, the Alpine Center closed as a center for the disabled as their care became community based. The impact to the local economy and the displaced workers was enormous. Hoover moved to another part of the state to work at a similar institution as did many of her relatives and other employees of the center. In 1982, Otsego County purchased the 160 acres and six buildings for $1. The complex was named the J. Richard Yuill Alpine Center. The Gaylord High School, University Center, 46th Circuit Court and a number of other county, state and federal agencies are now housed there.",1981,"Gaylord, Michigan",,
Michigan,Oak Grove Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oak_Grove_Sanitarium,,,1891,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Oak Grove Hospital,"Oak Grove Hospital, formerly Oak Grove Sanitarium, was organized under the laws of Michigan as Oak Grove Corporation in 1891, its object being the founding and administration of a thoroughly modern hospital for the treatment of nervous and mental diseases and of alcohol and drug addiction. Associated in the incipiency of the movement were James A. Remick and W. G. Vinton, of Detroit; Charles T. Mitchell, of Hillsdale, Michigan; and Dr. George C. Palmer, then superintendent of the Michigan asylum for the insane, at Kalamazoo.
The sixty-five-acre grove of native oaks located near the eastern outskirts of Flint was selected for a site. This grove is now probably the last remaining oak clearing in Michigan. It has been preserved by Governor Henry H. Crapo, his intention being to build therein a mansion.
The property was sold to the city of Flint shortly after closing & all buildings were demolished to make way for the new Flint High School in the early 1930s.",1920,"Flint, MI",,

Michigan,Southwestern Michigan Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Southwestern_Michigan_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,,,1954,Demolished,Single Building,,Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital Northwest Unit,"In 1954 the Southwestern Michigan Tuberculosis Sanatorium was constructed at a cost of $2.5 million dollars. A four-story, 45,000 square foot building set on several rolling acres, it held 200 beds for tuberculosis patients who were housed in a modern facility on Kalamazoo's Northwest side. The surroundings, overlooking the city, were pleasant, and treatment methods for the disease were the most up-to-date and successful for the day.
The Kalamazoo State Hospital had housed its own tubercular patients in a special facility at the Oakland Drive campus. In December of 1965, all mental patients from around the state who had tuberculosis were transferred to the sanatorium in Kalamazoo. This included the patients from KPH. The transfers also enabled the mental hospital to eliminate a waiting list for adults who needed admission to the facility.
In 1966 the sanatorium housed 40 patients under treatment for TB only, 29 with TB transferred from mental hospitals all over Michigan, and 108 custodial cases transferred from the KRPH who were all elderly and required no psychiatric treatment. These last had been confined to the state hospital for many years. They no longer needed treatment, but were not able to return to the community and needed bed rest and care.
By 1969, treatment of tuberculosis had improved so dramatically and had been so successful that the State of Michigan ordered the sanatorium shut down as a treatment center for the disease. Since so many patients from KPH were already housed there, it was decided that the facility would be taken over by the Michigan Department of Mental Health and turned over KPH. It operated as a unit that held 100 senile, partially bed-ridden patients and almost 100 ambulatory geriatric patients. The State of Michigan had provided funds in its 1969-70 state budget for the state hospital to run the facility. The main focus of treatment for the geriatric patients was an involvement program designed to help the patients return to ""normalcy."" Dr. James Curran, head of the gerontology program at the hospital, said of this focus, ""If a patient will become more aware of himself, his environment, and others, he has a better chance of coming out of that little dream world where no one bothers him.""
By 1990, because of the lowest patient count in recent history, it was decided to close the Northwest Unit. Only 26 patients were housed there, down from 120 in 1987. The total patient count at the hospital had shrunk to 367. The fate of the building, which was still in excellent condition, was to be determined by the State Department of Mental Health, which owned it, and the Department of Management and Budget. When the closure was announced, several private and public organizations expressed interest in acquiring it, but no action was taken.
The last serious offer to utilize the building came in 1997 from Western Michigan University. WMU administrators were looking at the building as a possible site for research offices, library storage and other possible uses, including consolidating the Center for Developmentally Disabled adults there. Although none of those plans ever came to fruition, WMU acquired the property in 1998 as part of a deal to transfer other KPH property from the state. It continued to sit vacant for more than a decade, and, despite WMU's security efforts, it continued to attract thrill-seekers and vandals. In 2010, the city decided to use federal grant money to eliminate the eyesore. The old hospital was finally demolished in late 2011. Title was transferred to the Kalamazoo County Land Bank, which has begun using the site to construct Prairie Gardens housing units for low-income seniors. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in February 2013",1990,"Kalamazoo, MI",,

Construction began in 1898 after a sisters suggestion that the salt bath facilities held curative properties and the spot was an ideal site for a convalescence home and hospital.
In 1900 the 3rd floor of the building, with 50 beds, were saved as a hospital facility and sanitarium.  By 1952 the mineral salt baths were phased out and the hospital converted to the treatment of chronic illness.
The facility still stands today as a registered historic site.  In 1990 ownership of the facility was transferred from the Sisters of Charity to Mercy Health Systems.

By the late 1960s, low populations led to the hospital's closure & was sold to the state of Michigan for $3 million in 1971.
