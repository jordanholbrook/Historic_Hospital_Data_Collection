Central State Hospital was a 192-bed adult psychiatric hospital located in eastern Louisville-Jefferson County, Kentucky. In 1869, 200 acres were purchased by the Kentucky State Legislature from the descendants of renown frontiersman Issac Hite to establish a ""State House of Reform for Juvenile Delinquents."" This was located on the outskirts of what would become Anchorage, Kentucky. In 1873, due to overcrowding at both of Kentucky's mental hospitals, the House of Reform was converted into the Fourth Kentucky Lunatic Asylum, with Dr. C.C. Forbes as its first Superintendent. The following year an act of the legislature renamed it the Central Kentucky Lunatic Asylum. In late 1887, it received its own post office, called simply ""Asylum"". The following year its name was changed to ""Lakeland"", and the institution was commonly referred to as ""Lakeland Hospital"" or ""Lakeland Asylum"". By 1900, its official name had been changed to the Central Kentucky Asylum for the Insane. By 1912 it was known as Central State Hospital. Comparable institutions are Eastern State Hospital at Lexington in Fayette County and Western State Hospital at Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky. All three were administered by the Board of Charitable Organizations.
The secluded, rural setting was typical of such facilities in the late 19th century, as such an environment was thought to be beneficial for recovery from mental illness. However, not all patients had mental disorders - some suffered from brain damage, mental retardation or were simply poor or elderly. The early years of the 1880s were marked by repeated allegations of patient abuse.
Throughout Central States history, the institution suffered from improper funding, understaffing, and overcrowding. Though built to accommodate 1,600 patients, by 1940 there were in excess of 2,400 patients and again various accusations of patient mistreatment began to arise. However, starting in the 1950s, changing community perception of the mentally disturbed, led to fewer patients staying permanently in mental hospitals. In 1962, $3,000,000 was allowed by the state to construct more modern facilities on LaGrange Road. Many of these are still standing.
In 1986, a new modern administration facility was completed on property adjacent to the 1960s buildings, The original hospital and surviving structures on what was called ""the North Campus"" were subsequently abandoned and later demolished in the late 1990s.
There are 2 cemeteries on the former hospital property that is now part of the E.P. Tom Sawyer State park. Strawberry Hill and Peace On Earth, with Strawberry Hill being the older of the two. All graves are marked and the number of patients buried there currently unknown. Ongoing research has brought the number to nearly 1,000 names.

The act incorporated a group of citizens, the “Contributors of the Fayette Hospital,” who wished to erect a building at their own expense to serve as a hospital for the accommodation of “lunatics” as well as other “sick poor.” The act gave the Contributors the right to establish a committee,
elect officers, raise money to purchase a piece of land in or near Lexington, and to contract for the construction of a building to serve as the hospital (An act for founding, 1816). The Contributors meet on March 1, 1816 and elected a building committee consisting of Andrew McCalla, Sterling Allen, Stephen Chipley, Thomas January,and Richard Higgins. McCalla was appointed chairman (Fayette Hospital, 1816). In
an open letter in the Kentucky Reporter on April 17, 1816, the Committee presented their mission and asked for assistance. They noted that there were many “poor, disabled, and infirm members of society” without the aid of medicine who with the assistance that could be provided by a “Public Hospital,” might become useful to themselves, their families, and society. They also noted that “lunatics,” who have no “rich relatives” to care for them, “roam at large through the country...” and in many instances “endanger the lives of other members of society.” The best remedy, they suggested, was the erection of a public hospital. They argued that the hospital was not only their best chance at a cure but also a means by which physicians could acquire “superior skill” by treating them. Finally, they declared that “society itself would be made more secure against the wild and desperate actions of lunatics, if provision was made to contain them within its walls.” The Committee concluded the letter by requesting that “ALL” people of Kentucky contribute to the support of the hospital (To the people of Kentucky, 1816).
Their early efforts must have been effective for not long after their incorporation, the Building Committee purchased the “Sinking Spring” property on which the present hospital now stands (Perrin 1882: 391). On June 30, 1817, the corner-stone of the “Fayette Hospital” building was laid in the presence of a large group of spectators. The oration was given by Henry Clay, U.S. Representative from Kentucky. In the corner-stone were deposited the newspapers of Lexington for that week, some silver and copper coins, two publications in favor of the institution.
Despite the Contributors’ efforts, the unfinished building was abandoned during the financial panic of 1819. Lexington was devastated by the economic crisis. In fact, one affluent member of the Hospital's Building Committee, Thomas January, was forced to close his factory after 24 years of successful operation (White 1984:24). Governor Adair’s address led to the formation of a committee to inquire into the feasibility of taking over the old Fayette Hospital and establishing a “State Lunatic Hospital.” In 1821, the Committee reported their findings to the Legislature. They discovered that the lot measured about 10 acres. It was supplied with a never failing spring and was well situated as to “health, beauty, and convenience, and may in future be extended to any limits or size commensurate with the objects of the said institution.” As to the building erected upon the site, they reported that it was “spacious, remotely situated from any other, and the workmanship, as far as it has been executed, is neat and faithfully done.” They estimated that the building when it “is properly finished, will afford accommodations for sixty or seventy lunatics, and all necessary attendants” (Journal of the Senate, 1821:139).
The Legislature agreed with the Committee's recommendation. The property was purchased and the “Lunatic Asylum of Kentucky” was established by an act passed on December 7, 1822. The Legislature appointed commissioners and appropriated $10,000.00 to finish the “skeleton of a house” in a “plain, substantial manner, and to erect such out-houses as are absolutely necessary....” The plan originally called for the addition of two wings so that the building could accommodate two hundred patients. They found, however, that the appropriation was insufficient to complete the wings and thus the building could only house one hundred and twenty patients. They estimated that it would cost an additional $10,000.00 to complete the two wings.
The building was finished and the hospital formally opened on May 1, 1824. When completed, the brick building measured approximately 66 feet square and was three stories tall over a stone basement. An 1847 lithograph is the earliest identified illustration of the building. The original Fayette Hospital building is the three-story square block with hipped roof located at the center of the illustration. The building was made of handmade brick laid in Flemish bonding. A skylight was located on the hipped roof. Tall chimneys pierced the roof at each corner.
The Fayette Hospital was originally designed to serve as a general medical hospital, not as a specialized insane asylum. As a result, like other medical hospitals of the time, it contained large rooms that functioned as wards with several beds in each room, unlike most asylums which usually contained small individual cells. In their first report to the Legislature, the Commissioners reported problems with the
design of the building. To try to solve the problem, the Commissioners erected, on the third floor, small temporary cells of plank. They reported, however, that the cells were all in one room, in which there was only one fire place, and consequently, only a few patients
could receive the heat. Also, the “quiet and repose” sometimes essential to treatment was impossible when the patients were “separated only by a plank partition.”
In 1825, they appropriated $5,735.74 for the building of one of the wings contemplated in the original plan of the building. The new brick wing measured 62 feet long by 22 feet wide and was two stories over a stone basement. Then in 1826, they erected a second wing, thereby completing the original plan of the building. Its dimensions were identical to the wing constructed the previous year. The cost of the new wing was $4,505.39.
As a result of their pleadings, in 1829 and 1830, “return wings” were constructed at the ends and perpendicular to the earlier wings (Tomes 1994:150). The brick return wings, three-stories tall over a stone basement, are illustrated on. Each return wing measured 60 by 19 feet and contained 32 rooms. When the four wings were completed, the left wing and return wing were used to house the male patients and the female patients were housed in the right wing and return wing. The twenty-five “spacious” rooms in the original center building were
used to accommodate the Superintendent and his family, the resident physician, and separate day-rooms and dining rooms for the male and female patients. One room on the upper floor, well lighted from a skylight on the roof, was used for surgical purposes. The basement under the original center building as well as the wings served as the kitchen which consisted of nine rooms containing cooking apartments, storerooms,
and servants’ rooms (Annual Report 1832).
Though greatly altered, the original Fayette Hospital building and some of its early additions are extant today. A description of its current condition is presented in Chapter IV. A comparison of the early Kentucky Lunatic Asylum and the Friends Asylum in Pennsylvania, described in the previous section, reveals remarkable similarities. Both consisted of a central houselike building flanked by wings with return wings at the ends. The wings consisted of small rooms arranged along corridors. Men lived on one side of the central building, women on the other. Soon after the wings were added to the original hospital, a separate building was constructed about “forty paces” to the rear. It was approximately 20 feet square, two-stories high, and contained 16 small rooms or “cells,” intended for the “worst class of patients,” and for withdrawing temporarily the “most turbulent and ungovernable”. The structure was identified as the “box room” on an 1832 ground plan of the hospital. This structure is no longer extant. The 1832 plan also shows the location of the original building with its wing additions,
two privies, a smoke-house, stable, wash-house, burying place, fences, pump and cistern and men's and women's airing yards.
In 1846, the Directors reported to the Legislature that they were not happy with their cure rate.They believed an addition to the original
building that was “so inconvenient, uncomfortable, and illy suited in almost every way, for the purposes of a Lunatic Asylum” (Annual Report, 1846:615), would solve their problems. As a result, in 1847, the building was once again enlarged with the addition of a rear ell.
The new ell was 110 feet long, 64 feet wide, and seven feet deep. It was united to the rear of the “central building” by an open porch, 64 feet long by 16 feet wide, with galleries corresponding with the floors of the main building and its wings. The Directors reported that the bricks for the new ell were made and carried to the site by the patients, who had performed all the labor, including the digging of the foundation. The rock for the foundation was blasted and quarried by the patients and they also performed a “considerable amount of the carpenters work.” According to
the Directors, the labor was beneficial to the health of the patients and they regretted that there was not enough suitable labor to employ all of the Asylum patients (Annual Report, 1846:599).
In 1852, a fire destroyed a part of the building “erected at an early day.” Though the cause of the fire was never determined, the Superintendent recommended that the Asylum switch to gas lighting which could be obtained from the city. In 1863 the Managers reported that: “Iron bath-tubs have replaced decayed wooden ones. Worn out floors...have been laid. The leakage through the old floors had destroyed much of the plastering on our ceilings, all of which has been renewed chiefly by the labor of one of our patients.... Besides these, all the ordinary repairs throughout the building have been made, But the most important improvement of the year is the introduction of gas for lighting the building.
While there was constant maintenance and remodeling of the older buildings, the next major construction project took place in 1867 when a new building was erected to house the women. This was the first major addition to the hospital since the AMSAII and Kirkbride published their recommendations on asylum architecture. We know that the Directors of the Kentucky Lunatic Asylum were well aware of their work for in 1859 they hosted the annual meetings of the AMSAII in Lexington and they quoted Kirkbride (Conventions, 1859) and summarized the AMSAII's
propositions on the construction and organization of hospitals for the insane in their annual reports (Annual Report, 1859: 35-37).
In 1856, when Kirkbride expanded his Pennsylvania hospital, he argued that there were many advantages to treating men and women in different buildings and as a result, he chose to construct an entirely new building. The original building became the female department, the new structure the male department (Tomes 1994:154). Kentucky followed Kirkbride's lead and in 1868 when they enlarged the hospital, they chose to construct an entirely new building. In this case, however, the new building, served as the Female Ward, the old building became the Male Ward.
The new building looked similar to the old. It was built of Flemish bond brick and consisted of a central block with wings capped by return wings. It was built just 40 feet left of, and in-line with, the old structure, creating a long linear plan. The new structure was larger, however. It measured 440 feet long, and varied in depth from 36 to 78 feet. The entire structure sat over a basement. The center four-story block and one of the three-story return wings were topped by lanterns.
While most of the patients at the Kentucky Lunatic Asylum were paupers, their care paid for by the State, there were always a small number of boarders whose care was paid for by their families and friends. Henry Clay's son, Theodore, for example, was a patient at the Kentucky
Lunatic Asylum in the 1830s. Unlike the typical patient, he was allowed to bring along his favorite horse (White 1984:144). There is other evidence that the paying boarders were offered preferential treatment, for example, in 1845, the Superintendent suggested that in order to attract paying boarders, they needed to “fit up a sufficient number of rooms in a handsome style, to accommodate a class of
patients whose friends wish them supplied in a way to which they have been accustomed...”(Annual Report 1845:629).
Dorthea Dix visited the hospital in 1846 & 1858 in an effort for better treatment of patients and improved living conditions. This lead to the addition of several wings & a new building. In 1862, a year after the start of the Civil War, employees were required to take an oath of allegiance to the U.S. During the war the hospital was occupied by Confederate forces for a short time and operated as a hospital for sick & wounded soldiers along with the regular mentally ill patients.
In 1894,the Administration Building was constructed to serve as offices, sleeping quarters and a ballroom. The three-story, brick Neo-
Classical style building was designed by Curtain & Hutchings, a Louisville architectural firm (The Plans 1894). The Administration Building was
located between and slightly in front of the Female and Male Buildings, creating an assemblage of buildings resembling a Kirkbride plan. The
new Administration Building became the new center block and the Female and Male Buildings, set back en echelon, became the wings. A ballroom was located on the third floor of the Administration Building. Parties and dances were commonplace at nineteenth-century asylums. Frequently
called “lunatic balls,” they were often used as fund raisers. There is evidence that the Eastern Kentucky Lunatic Asylum held a ball as early as 1869. Over 300 guests attended the event in 1888.
The first patient admitted to the Kentucky Lunatic Asylum was a “negro” woman from Woodford County. Unfortunately there are no records that reveal the living conditions of African American patients during the earliest years of the institutions history. At the Alabama Insane Hospital, blacks were assigned to the basements, which were considered the worst of the wards, until separate facilities were constructed. It is likely that this was the case at the Kentucky Lunatic Asylum as well. It appears, however, that there may not have been many African Americans
admitted to the Kentucky Lunatic Asylum until after the Civil War. In 1845, for example, the Superintendent pleaded to the legislature for the appropriation of funds to build accommodations for blacks.
In 1869, money was appropriated to enlarge an existing building, located about two hundred yards from the main white ward, for the
use of “negro lunatics.” It was a brick structure, eighty-five feet long, forty-four feet deep, having three stories and a basement. In 1896, the Superintendent once again warned that the accommodations for the “colored patients” was “totally unfit.” “The building is old and dilapidated,
ventilation poor, day-rooms too small, and the lights bad.” He recommended that a brick building, sufficient to accommodate two hundred and fifty patients, with hospital wards attached for males and females, be erected. In the meantime, a building disconnected from the main building that was formerly an engine room and laundry was converted into quarters for the “quit colored female patients,” thereby relieving the main “colored” building from crowded conditions (Annual Report 1896:14).
The relief was temporary, however, for in 1898, he reported that the “negro male patients, irrespective of the types of their maladies, are crowded into one ward. Every consideration dictates that these patients should be intelligently classified and separated into wards according to the nature of their respective maladies, as is attempted to be done with the white patients” (Annual Report 1898:8). In 1913, the Superintendent pleaded that a “new building for colored females” was an “absolute necessity.” He explained that in “a building erected in 1817, with no
modern improvements, we are conducting a male and female ward, separated only by a brick partition wall, with a sufficient number of colored male patients to fill the whole building, nearby, we have another colored female ward in a building at one time used as a laundry, and which now should be condemned” (Annual Report1913:40).
It does not appear that a new building dedicated to the housing of African American patients was constructed until 1951 when the Wendell building was constructed. The building was named after Thomas Tyler Wendell, an African American physician that served the Asylum as well as the Lexington community during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. No longer segregated, the building serves as patient housing today.
In 1829, the Legislature appropriated $1,200.00 to erect three brick walls, to enclose a yard around the asylum for the exercise of the patients. The walls were to enclose about an acre and a half, in the rear of the buildings. The ground to be enclosed by the walls was to be divided into three yards; one for females and the other two for males; so as to allow a separation of the males into two classes.
In 1861, one hundred and thirty acres of land was finally added to the asylum. A stable for milk cows, 84 feet long and 16 feet wide was erected, along with a carriage house, wagon shed, piggery and a slaughter house. A comparison of the small rectangular airing yards for males and females depicted on the 1837 site plan, and the 1861 topographic map titled “The Pleasure Grounds” shows how far landscape design had come at the Kentucky
Lunatic Asylum. The 1861 map depicts circular drives, groves of trees, a flower garden, fountain, orchard, and fish pond. They continued to add to the grounds over the years. For example, in 1875 a large reservoir was completed. In 1898, they supplemented the orchard by planting four hundred fruit trees, including: 100 plum, 100 peach, 100 pear, and 100 cherry trees. In addition to the male and female buildings, an 1871 birds eye view of the asylum shows a network of circular drives and groves of trees and an 1877 atlas of the site shows an even more extensive network of roads and walks. In fact, as late as 1901, several thousand additional feet of walks were being laid. In 1869, the Directors reported that “our pleasure grounds, provided with seats, arbors, flower gardens, swings, & ca., are extensive, and are growing more beautiful every day (Annual Report 1869:16).
In 1904, a pair of bowling alleys by the Brunswick Balke Collender Company, and a new building to house them was constructed near building 23(Annual Report 1904:8). The bowling alleys are no longer standing.
1904 the Superintendent requested an appropriation for the erection of a “modern laundry.” He explained that the present one was situated over the engine room, where steam and coal dust filter through the floor and make it next to impossible to properly launder the clothing. In addition, he argued, during the warm months the laundry employees are forced to do their work in a temperature of one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty degrees, owing to the excessive heat from the engine room. The new laundry was completed in 1906 and looks today, much as it did when constructed.
In 1913, the Superintendent declared that in “this day of enlightenment, a hospital for the insane without special quarters for Tubercular and Pellagra patients separate and distinct from the main buildings, is criminal negligence, and should not be tolerated”. A tubercular hospital, designed to comfortably accommodate twenty-two patients, was completed in 1914. This structure is longer standing.
In 1915, the Superintendent proclaimed that a “nurses home” is “badly needed” and “would enable us to have better nurses and retain them longer. Working and sleeping in the same ward, and surrounded by patients,year after year, is not conductive to health or capacity”. In 1927 the nurses home was constructed. It was a two-story brick building with a capacity for thirty-six nurses. All of the excavating work was done by inmate labor, and the entire upper floor of the building was completed by the institution forces.
In the 1920s, the Superintendent reported that Eastern State Hospital was the only institution in the United States experimenting with the use of sawdust beds for the “helpless, untidy insane.” He explained that once he learned of their use in Germany he had thirty-four of the beds installed at Eastern State Hospital. They were oblong boxes, made of one-inch dressed boards six and one-half feet long, thirty
inches wide, and eighteen inches deep, standing on legs twelve inches high and painted white. They were filled with fresh sawdust to within six inches of the top. According to the Superintendent, the patient, clothed in a short night shirt, laid directly on the sawdust, which conformed to the shape of the body. A pillow was placed under the head and the patient was covered with a sheet and blanket. He explained that the excrement from the bowels and kidneys with the small amount of sawdust that was soiled was scooped out immediately with an ordinary six inch
scoop. Fresh saw dust was added from time to time to keep the total amount up to the twelve-inch level (Annual Report 1925-1927). It is unclear how long sawdust beds were employed at Eastern State Hospital.
Between 1938 and 1943 the Gragg building was renovated, this was the hospital's original building completed in 1824. At the end of WW 2 the hospital reached it's peak population of just over 2,000. Also new treatments were being used, including Electro and Metrozol shock treatment, Malarial fever therapy & lobotomies. The patient population began to finally decline by the mid-1950s, at this time the Wendell and Allen buildings were completed. Farming operations, run by the patients was terminated in 1957 & property sold to IBM for their new facility. 1967 brought the first patient population under 1,000 in many years.
On September 10th, 2013 the patients were moved to the new facility & the old hospital officially closed. Demolition of all buildings, except the Administration & laundry buildings, was complete by February 2014.
In October, 2013 a new facility was opened under the same name. This replaced the aging one, the property having been turned over to BCTC (Bluegrass Community Technical College). The new hospital consists of 3 patient care towers of 3 floors each. The towers link to the old hospital in their names; Allen, Gragg & Wendell. They were opened in October 2013 with the Allen to open in 2014. The new campus also includes the  Central Kentucky Recovery Center, 4 personal care buildings designed to help individuals return to the community. Located on the University of Kentucky's Coldstream Research Campus and managed by UK HealthCare, the state-owned facility will provide care for patients from Fayette and surrounding 49 counties.

There is a cemetery at the rear of the property that contains approx. 4,000 to 6,000 sets of remains of former patients buried on the property between 1824 & 1956. This cemetery has been in place since 1984 after the original cemetery had been moved twice. An unknown number graves exist throughout the hospital containing as may as 4,000 additional graves.

Kentucky,Kentucky Institution for Feeble Minded Children,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Frankfort_State_Hospital,1854,,1860,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Kentucky State Institute for the Education of Feeble Minded Children and Idiots | Kentucky Training Home | Frankfort State Hospital and School,"In 1855 Governor Morehead addressed the legislature and called attention to the need for caring for feeble-minded children in the state. A bill was introduced to establish such a facility in Danville. It was not enacted until the next Governor. Dr. Joseph Parris offered to visit the Kentucky Legislature, bringing some of his institutionalized children from Pennsylvania to demonstrate how practical the work with them was. It was estimated that there were approximately 800 mentally challenged children in the state at that time. On December 6, 1859 Governor Magoffin recommended that an institution be established for the care & education of the feeble-minded. A bill was passed and signed by the governor complying with his recommendations march 1st, 1860.
The first child was admitted to the institution August 16, 1860. Her name was Lizzie Bradford of Augusta, Kentucky and she was about 14 years old. Until 15 years after it opened, no complete records were kept of patients admitted or released at the institution. A new building was immediately planned to house an additional 75 children, making a total of 90 that could be accommodated. This number was not reached until 1872. In 1869 $40,000 was appropriated for an additional building that was completed in 1872. It was suggested in 1866 that the purpose of the institution be changed so that the lowest grade of untrainable children could be admitted. there were 3 categories of patient, at the time, idiots, imbecile & feeble-minded. This was determined by an IQ test administered by hospital staff. Around the sametime it was decided to establish a mechanical department in connection with the school. In it, mattresses, brooms, brushes and shoes were made. In addition to this, other activites were added. Gymnastics, singing, sewing and farm work occupied the children's' time.
By 1921 it housed 470 patients but the capacity was only 350. The buildings according to an annual report stated the buildings were ""old & ill adapted to modern methods of work"". Making matters worse was the fact that Kentucky retained its Pauper Idiot Pension Law, a holdover from antebellum times. The law, the only of its kind in the nation, allowed payment of $75 per year to the families of poor feeble-minded individuals in the community. In 1917, 2,352 feeble-minded people received payments, the law was repealed in 1922. By the 1920s an effort was made to pass sterilization laws for Kentucky. None were ever passed & the institution changed its name to Kentucky Training home in 1945 and was a 1,018 bed facility.
Due to funding issues and declining patient population along with several scandals and a homicide of a patient the hospital was closed in the 1970's. Most of the patients were moved to the other 3 state hospitals or one of the several facilities for mentally challenged. All but 1 building was demolished and the state built a large office building in it's place.
At the south end of the property the cemetery remains. It contains Approximately 500 graves & most are marked ""Unknown"", only about 14 have names on their headstones.

Although the institution was designed to house 486, with double bunking in 1990, the operational capacity was raised to 995. In February 2002 the addition of 104 daybeds to Units 7A, 7B and 7C increased the operational capacity to 1,099.

Kentucky,Kentucky State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kentucky_State_Hospital,,1941,1942,Active,Cottage Plan,,Darnell Hospital | Danville Youth Development Center | Northpoint Training Center,"The institution was originally constructed as a state mental hospital. Beginning in 1941, the United States Army assumed control of the facilities to provide care for soldiers suffering from psychiatric illness. While operated by the Army from 1941 to 1946, the Darnell Hospital had the capability to house approximately 880 ill soldiers and was also utilized to contain German prisoners of war. In 1946, the hospital was returned to state control for the sum of $1. Interestingly, employees desiring to be a part of the transaction contributed 100 pennies for the purchase price. The facilities were operated as the Kentucky State Hospital from 1946 until 1977 when phased to the control of the Bureau of Social Services. For five years, from July 1977 through February 1983, the Danville Youth Development Center was utilized as a youth center for juvenile offenders.
The Department of Corrections received control of the property, consisting of 551 acres and approximately 50 structures, in January 1983. Northpoint Training Center was initially conceived as a minimum-security institution for fewer than 500 inmates, but the mission rapidly changed to a medium-security institution with a proposed population of approximately 700 inmates. Today, the institution operates as a medium-security institution with a current bed capacity of 1,256 inmates. The institution currently consists of 1,108 general population medium-security beds, 60 special management beds, and 40 minimum-security beds. In 2009 the prison was the scene of a riot destroying several of the original buildings.
An unknown number of patients are buried in 2 cemeteries on the property. It is suspected some graves are those of German POWs that were housed here during WW2. A Cremation Oven stood near the grave yard at least until 1982 when it became a state prison.

Kentucky,Western State Hospital Hopkinsville,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Western_State_Hospital_Hopkinsville,,1848,1850,Active and Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Major N.B. Kelly,Western Lunatic Asylum of Kentucky | Western State Hospital,"On the 25th of February, 1848, the Legislature of Kentucky provided for the location and erection of a second lunatic asylum. The Spring Hill tract of 383 acres of land (which proved to be of indifferent quality) on the turnpike road east of Hopkinsville, was purchased for $1,971.50 (only $5.14 per acre). This sum was refunded by the citizens, and $2,000 additional paid by them. There was expended upon the buildings and other improvements in 1849 $43,052; in 1850, $43,484; the additional outlays for these purposes do not appear in any documents before us. The Legislature appropriated $15,000 in 1848, $20,000 in 1849, $45,000 in 1850, $35,000 in 1851 $43,000 in 1852, $44,017 in 1854; total, $202,017. September 1, 1854, the first patients were received. By December 1, 1857, 208 had been admitted, but only 102 were then in the institution, the others having died, eloped, or been restored and discharged under the care of the Superintendent, Dr. S. Annan. The number admitted in 1858, 106; and in 1859 to December 1st, 129 ; total for two years, 235 ; during the same time 133 were discharged, of whom 65 were restored, 56 died, and 10 escaped.
On the 30th of November, 1861, the main building was destroyed at mid-day by fire, which caught from sparks from a chimney falling upon a shingle roof. The 210 patients escaped uninjured, except one, who fastened himself in his room, near where the fire originated, and perished in the flames. The court house and other buildings in Hopkinsville were kindly tendered for the use of the unfortunates; twenty-three hewed log-cabins were speedily erected at about $90 each, and everything done that could well be to mitigate the sufferings of the patients. The walls being mainly uninjured it was estimated that $50,000 would replace the brick and wood work, and $67,000 more (including $3,856 for tin roof and gutters) would complete the building. In February, 1861, the Legislature made an appropriation to begin it, and before January 1, 1867, had appropriated in all $258,930 to complete the rebuilding. This, added to the manager’s probable net valuation of the property after the destruction by fire of the interior of the main building $145,420 (exclusive of the enhanced value of the land itself, makes the total value of the improvements at that time (1867) $404,350, providing comfortably for 325 patients.
Some time in the year 1863 the present able and successful Superintendent, Dr. James Rodman, took charge of the asylum. The total number of patients received and treated up to October 10, 1871, was 1.273. of whom 321 were then in the asylum. Calculated upon the number of patients received, 50.847 per cent were discharged restored, eight were discharged more or less improved, two were unimproved, one escaped and twenty-two died. There is (nearly) one insane person (October, 1871) in every 1,000 persons of the population, at least 1,400 in Kentucky, of whom there is room in the two asylums for only 850, and both are full.
The Kentucky General Assembly changed the name of the hospital to Western State Hospital in 1919. Investigations by state officials and the Welfare Committee in the late 1930s resulted in renovations and higher standards. In 1950, 2,200 patients were admitted as ""incompetent"" with loss of rights. Tranquilizers came into use in 1955. By the late 1950s, several psychotropic medications were being marketed and there was a deinstitutionalization effort to weed out patients that did not need to be at the facility.
Today Western State Hospital is a 222-bed psychiatric hospital serving individuals 18 or older from a 34-county area in western Kentucky. It provides acute psychiatric care for mentally ill patients, psychiatric rehabilitation for chronic mental illness and provides acute psychiatric care for geriatric patients. Its other two buildings include Western State Nursing Facility — a 144-bed treatment facility for mentally disabled geriatric residents that provides care for adults with severe and persistent mental illness who require nursing-facility level of care. Patients can only be admitted as transfers from state psychiatric facilities within Kentucky.

The first burial was held shortly after the hospital opened and was used until the early 1960s. The exact number of graves is not known but somewhere around 5,000-7,000 former patients are buried there and are all unmarked.

A bill was introduced to establish such a facility in Danville. It was not enacted until the next Governor. Dr. Joseph Parris offered to visit the Kentucky Legislature, bringing some of his institutionalized children from Pennsylvania to demonstrate how practical the work with them was. It was estimated that there were approximately 800 mentally challenged children in the state at that time. On December 6, 1859 Governor Magoffin recommended that an institution be established for the care & education of the feeble-minded. A bill was passed and signed by the governor complying with his recommendations march 1st, 1860.
The first child was admitted to the institution August 16, 1860. Her name was Lizzie Bradford of Augusta, Kentucky and she was about 14 years old. Until 15 years after it opened, no complete records were kept of patients admitted or released at the institution. A new building was immediately planned to house an additional 75 children, making a total of 90 that could be accommodated. This number was not reached until 1872. In 1869 $40,000 was appropriated for an additional building that was completed in 1872. It was suggested in 1866 that the purpose of the institution be changed so that the lowest grade of untrainable children could be admitted. there were 3 categories of patient, at the time, idiots, imbecile & feeble-minded. This was determined by an IQ test administered by hospital staff. Around the sametime it was decided to establish a mechanical department in connection with the school. In it, mattresses, brooms, brushes and shoes were made. In addition to this, other activites were added. Gymnastics, singing, sewing and farm work occupied the children's' time.
By 1921 it housed 470 patients but the capacity was only 350. The buildings according to an annual report stated the buildings were ""old & ill adapted to modern methods of work"". Making matters worse was the fact that Kentucky retained its Pauper Idiot Pension Law, a holdover from antebellum times. The law, the only of its kind in the nation, allowed payment of $75 per year to the families of poor feeble-minded individuals in the community. In 1917, 2,352 feeble-minded people received payments, the law was repealed in 1922. By the 1920s an effort was made to pass sterilization laws for Kentucky. None were ever passed & the institution changed its name to Kentucky Training home in 1945 and was a 1,018 bed facility.
Due to funding issues and declining patient population along with several scandals and a homicide of a patient the hospital was closed in the 1970's. Most of the patients were moved to the other 3 state hospitals or one of the several facilities for mentally challenged. All but 1 building was demolished and the state built a large office building in it's place.
At the south end of the property the cemetery remains. It contains Approximately 500 graves & most are marked ""Unknown"", only about 14 have names on their headstones.

Reformers favored locating child care facilities away from the cities and the new interurban electric rail lines made the use of a rural site practical.  The facility was to be run by a bipartisan Board of Managers appointed by the mayor and county judge.
The residential campus for white children was called Ormsby Village, and the campus for blacks was called Ridgewood and had a separate entrance off of Dorsey. The home put into practice some of the most advanced ideas in juvenile care to be found anywhere in the United States. The campus contained an administration building, central dining hall and kitchen, a service building, a school and a hospital. There were 14 cottages that could hold 40 children each. There were athletic fields, a swimming pool, poultry yards and a dairy. The historic house on the property, Bellevoir, became the residence of the superintendent.
The majority of the children were dependents whose parents could no longer care for them. Children who committed mild form of delinquency were also admitted. The home housed over 400 children at the height of its operation in the 1930s to the early 1950s. Occupancy became less and less and in the early 1960s the school was closed. In 1968 the Board of Managers was dissolved and the control of the facility was handed over to the Metro Social Services Department. The Ridgewood buildings were leased to the state and renamed Lynnwood. The facilities were closed in 1975.
During the 1980s the property was used for a community gardens and then the Kentucky Railway Museum. In 1987 the county sold most of the land which would be developed as Hurstbourne Green.

Kentucky,Lexington Veterans Affairs Medical Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lexington_Veterans_Affairs_Medical_Center,1930,,1931,Active,Pavilion Plan,,,"In 1930, President Franklin D. Roosevelt consolidated and coordinated veterans benefits through the creation of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That same year, construction was underway at the Leestown Road facility. In 1934, the facility was converted to a veterans' neuropsychiatric facility which prompted the construction of many recreational facilities on the campus including a softball field, horseshoe pits and a miniature golf course.
The Main Building is one of eleven original buildings at the medical facility's campus. Though it remains an active center of treatment, construction and development of the campus ceased in 1950 with a total of forty-one buildings of which the Main Building remains the largest and the most ornamental. The focus of the building's symmetrical design is a three-bay projecting pavilion with four terra cotta pilasters beneath the all-seeing oculus in the pediment's tympanum. Until 1950, a wood and copper cupola towered above the pediment, but it was removed in 1950 after having been twice struck by lighting leaving only the cupola's brick base.
Although the number of buildings at the Leestown VA have increased over the years, the overall acreage of the campus has decreased from an original 291 acres to only 135 acres today. With over 92,000 veterans in the Lexington service area, the hospital is an important component to caring for those who have served in uniform. The Leestown facility offers inpatient post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment, nursing home and hospice care, home-based primary care, prosthetics and orthotics, geriatrics, optometry, mental health, and substance abuse treatment.

Kentucky,U.S. Narcotics Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=U.S._Narcotics_Farm,,1933,1935,Active,Rambling Plan,,U.S. Public Health Service Hospital | National Institute of Mental Health | Clinical Research Center | Federal Medical Center,"For nearly four decades, from the 1930s to the '70s, Lexington was a center for drug research and treatment. It drew addicts talented and desperate, obscure and celebrated, and provided free treatment and more: job training, sports, dental help, music lessons, even manicures. Research done there, much of it conducted with volunteer human subjects, yielded insights into drug addiction that still resonate today.
Jazz greats Chet Baker and Elvin Jones took the Lexington Cure. So did William S. Burroughs and his son, both of whom wrote about it. The father described the grueling detox but opined that the food was excellent. The son wrote about the place's isolation, and the joys of landing an easy job on-site.
A 1930s New Deal era project, Narco was a joint venture of the Public Health Service and the Bureau of Prisons. The notion that thorny problems are best solved by a centralized bureaucracy is a concept that has seen happier days, but Narco's founders were sure that government, fueled by money and manpower, could change a nation's social landscape — from Lexington and a facility in Fort Worth Texas, that opened in 1938.
Lexington's countryside setting was important because this was a project that idealized rural life, built on a belief that if you turned up hopelessly addicted and worked in the sun, learned wholesome values, got dental care and played golf, maybe you could leave drugs behind. The nation, in the throes of the Depression, was flush with ambition if not cash, and drug addiction was seen as more of a bad habit than a brain-based physiological craving. But the odds of success with treatment at Narco were, it turned out, abysmally bad — as low as 7 percent, according to a 1962 survey.
""She rose proudly. She had spires and Roman cornices and Greek ramparts and punk American Depression symbols of electricity that coursed about the pregnant dirtybrown marble belly, and She pronounced the smug disunity of her period with disordered extensions and low, latched-on excrescences, and windows, windows, thousands & thousands of windows that hadn't been washed in decades, and stared like the cataract eyes of a square caterpillar onto the peacefully curving road that led into the black socket of her navel."" — from The Farm by Clarence Cooper Jr., written in 1966
The Lexington Cure drew pop culture portrayals like a July picnic draws flies, but its depiction in the press changed over the decades, from unabashed heroic poses in the 1930s to the lurid tabloid coverage of the '50s. Photos from 1951 feature a patient undergoing withdrawal in the ""shooting gallery,"" male patients lined up for a shot of morphine during detoxification. The caption on a photo of a barefoot teenage girl, face buried in her hands, reads: ""Sweating it out after the withdrawal phase, a 17-year-old sits despondently on her bed, fighting the craving. Out of curiosity because others in her crowd took it, she smoked marijuana at 13 for a bang, then took heroin 'for a lift.'""
Heroin's popularity in the era's jazz circles, and the musicians' subsequent trips to Lexington, provided Narco with one of its greatest claims to fame: the Narco jazz band. But no audio of the band — including its 1964 performance on Johnny Carson's late-night television talk show — still exists. The band has a nickname: ""the greatest band you never heard."" The level of talent that passed through Narco was staggering: from jazz musicians to writers to those whose talents vanished beneath their unconquered addictions.
The Narco Farm was a prison, but it also offered free drug treatment to almost anyone who asked. Once on site, it was difficult to tell who was considered a criminal and who had simply lost their way to heroin — a drug once touted in the same ad with Bayer aspirin as a cure for coughs. All sorts of people checked in to Narco, but patient demographics shifted over the decades. When Narco first opened, its population skewed toward older, white addicts. But in the 1940s, more young addicts and African-Americans? were admitted. The Lexington Herald reported in 1955 that most Narco residents were addicted to heroin and the average patient was young and likely to be of African-American? or Latino descent.
Starting in 1968, those who qualified could serve six months of civil commitment for drug treatment instead of jail. Lexington became the toast of the civil commitment program.
But by 1972, the idea of a small treatment community that had evolved out of the behemoth Narco had become poisonous. The Lexington Herald reported in the early 1970s allegations that at Matrix House, one of the small communities, ""some of the patients were stripped of their clothing and their pubic hair burned off, that some of the male patients' genitals were placed in ice water for long periods of time."" Nude rituals and bomb-making were also alleged. By 1973, though, even the center's former boosters had turned against it. Dr. Harold Conrad, chief of the addiction research center at Narco, dismissed the place as being remote and no longer nationally unique.
In 1974, Narco was closed as a therapeutic center. On Dec. 31, 1976, the last human research subject there was transferred out. In 1984, its addiction research operations were moved to Baltimore. The prison became a Federal Correctional Institution, and then in 1991, changed its name to the Federal Medical Center. Hundreds of acres became Lexington's Masterson Station Park.
Now, 73 years after the complex opened, the drive up the hill is still as long as William Burroughs Jr. described it, and the architecture is still an exemplar of the United States governmental-behemoth style — a Biltmore built of good intentions. But it's now in the Lexington suburbs, not in the American countryside.
Even with cyclone fencing that lines the front façade, it still looks like a castle on the hill.

Located on a hill in a forested area outside the city limits, it provided privacy, a scenic view and a healthful atmosphere. Mt.

In their first fund-raising appeal since their foundation in 1812, the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth launched a citywide drive for funds to build the hospital. Parishes, physicians, public officials, and persons of all faiths gave generously. The blessing of Our Lady of Peace Hospital by Archbishop Floersh was held on December 8, 1950, followed by a tour of the Hospital for Kentucky and United States health officials. Later, an open house was scheduled for the public. Sister Mary Benigna Heslin was appointed administrator and fifteen SCNs staffed the new hospital.
By 1955, Our Lady of Peace Nursing Program was in full operation. A 13-week program in psychiatric care, a mandatory requirement for all nurses in training, brought to Our Lady of Peace an average of 50 to 60 student nurses. That Louisville and surrounding areas needed a psychiatric hospital was evident in 1956.Only five years after the opening of the hospital, Our Lady of Peace made plans for a new wing. The hospital needed 100 additional beds, a rehabilitation center, and a convent for the sisters on staff. The Federal Government contributed $500,000 to the project and Nazareth assumed the balance of the debt. Another addition, East Hall, added more space for vital services. Sister Dolores Greenwell, SCN, a nurse at Our Lady of Peace from 1956-1960, did psychiatric nursing in the 260-bed facility. Sister Dolores said the hospital was consistently filled to capacity.
Our Lady of Peace is one of the largest private, nonprofit psychiatric hospitals in the country. It treats patients with emotional, as well as behavioral, psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. The facility offers an array of specialized units and programs including short-term acute/sub-acute inpatient care and innovative alternatives such as partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs for children, adolescents and adults. The hospital was founded as an adult hospital in 1951 by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth and currently operates 261 inpatient beds.
In 1989, its mission expanded to meet an overwhelming need for quality pediatric care. As a result, Our Lady of Peace is now the largest private provider of youth behavioral health services in the country and has more inpatient beds for children than any hospital in Kentucky. It offers specialty programs for children and adolescents who have complex treatment needs, such as intellectual or developmental disabilities, forensic issues and/or mental illness and cooccurring mental health and substance use disorders.

Kentucky,Sprague's Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sprague%27s_Sanitarium,,,1883,Demolished,Single Building,,Our Lady of the Oaks Hospital | High Oaks Sanatorium,"Founded in 1883 by Dr. Chenault, former superintendent of Eastern State Hospital, on South Broadway for the treatment of mental & nervous disorders. He died in the early 1890s and operation was turned over to Dr. Silas Evans. In April 1899 he was then succeeded by Dr. George R. Sprague after recommendation by a friend who was on staff at Danvers State Hospital. By 1912 Mrs. Chenault, who still owned the asylum, sold the property to a tobacco company who cleared the land for a large tobacco warehouse. Dr. Sprague purchased an 83-acre tract the following year just south of the old location on Harrodsburg Rd. Eighteen acres were reserved for the sanitarium with the rest developed for a market garden. It's operation continued until 1945 when the hospital closed due to Dr. George S. Sprague's ill health, son of it's founder. Later that year it was sold to the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, who also operated Our Lady Of Peace in Louisville. The sisters turned the hospital into a for the treatment of ""nervous and emotionally disturbed"" women. In 1960 St. Joseph hospital opened it's new building and the sanitarium was moved into this facility. The old building was used as housing for the sisters until it was demolished in 1971.",1960,"Lexington, KY",,

The campus provides a beautiful setting for its current and beautiful purpose.  Now on the National Register of Historic Places, the school offers a one-of-a-kind community where those with intellectual disabilities are truly appreciated as the people they are.
When Dr. John Quincy Adams Stewart founded Stewart Home & School in 1893 on the campus of his own school, the Kentucky Military Institute, people with intellectual disabilities were often denied an educational opportunity in the public schools.  He truly was a pioneer in the field of special education as he set about to institute a school for people of all ages to be given that opportunity.  Over its one hundred and twenty-one year history, Stewart Home & School has been owned and directed by five successive generations of the Stewart family.  Today, Dr. John Poague Stewart continues the traditions of the school’s remarkable past and extends its dynamic mission into the future.  The school continues to provide a campus community for individuals who want to continue to learn and who need a very special educational environment in which to maximize their potential.

Kentucky,Ashland TB Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ashland_TB_Hospital,,1946,1948,Preserved,Single Building,,District Four State Tuberculosis Hospital,"From the National Historic Register of Historic Places Registration Form
The main building of the State Tuberculosis Hospital District 4 at Ashland KY is a 4 story steel frame structure with concrete floors and composite roof. Constructed in 1946, the hospital was integral to the state's crusade against TB in the 20th century. It is an almost identical twin to the Paris TB hospital.
A 30 acre tract of land was purchased by the state for use and benefit of the Kentucky Tuberculosis Sanatoria Commission as noted in the deed from March 1945. It was purchased from Alfred Hanses for $1. During the years 19245 to 1973 it remained a TB hospital until it was closed by the state. It remained vacant until 1985 when the Kentucky State Police started using the 4th floor as a forensic crime lab. In 1989 Safe Harbor Inc moved into the former nurses quarters and remain there today. The KSP crime lab has moved out of the main building but will likely be occupied by Pathways inc, an outpatient group. In early 2008, the main building and the other 4 buildings were added to the National Historic Register.",1973,"Ashland, KY",,
Kentucky,Covington-Kenton County Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Covington-Kenton_County_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,,,1951,Preserved,Single Building,,NorthKey Community Care Children’s Intensive Services Hospital,"In 1948, the building of a new hospital was finally made possible when voters approved a $400,000 bond and the state of Kentucky contributed $150,000. Federal funds in the amount of $200,000 were also granted under the Hill-Burton Act. The project was started in 1949 and finished in 1951. Dedication of the Covington-Kenton County Tuberculosis Sanatorium took place on April 16,1951. The first 17 patients were admitted to the facility on the same day, being transferred from the
Pest House across the street which had been treating TB patients since 1912. The new hospital, constructed on what was then named Sanatorium Drive,was the dream of many, including Dr. Charles J. Farrell, who became the facility’s first medical superintendent and who held that position for 25 of the 28 years the hospital remained open. Sanatorium Road would later be named Farrell Drive in his honor. The hospital had four floors. Located in the large basement area were the engineering department, laundry, and morgue.
The first floor contained the admitting department, administrator’s offices, the supervisor of nurses’ office, Dr. Farrell’s office, and the X-Ray department. Also on the first floor was a huge modern kitchen, food storage area, large cafeteria, and meeting room. The second floor was used for patients, specifically the women and children. The second floor also housed a large surgical room, dental laboratory, and nurses’ lounge. There were two large bathrooms for patients, one at each end of the long hallway. A small kitchen and dishwasher was also contained on the second floor where patients’ dishes were cleaned and sanitized after each meal. There was also a recreation area at the end of the hallway, for those patients who were allowed out of bed. The third floor, similar to the set-up of the second floor, was used for the men and teenage boys. Surgery was an option for treatment of many, especially during the first 10 years and before better medication was developed. Removal of a lung was commonplace. Without surgery, bed confinements were as long as five years. Dr. Marc J. Reardon performed most of the surgeries at the hospital, assisted by surgical nurse, Faye Fogle. These operations began at the Sanatorium on June 6, 1951. All patients, however, were not candidates for surgery, as many had the disease in only a small part of their bodies. Bed rest and medication worked for many of them. Since some patients were required to stay for years, many turned to crafts such as painting, leatherwork, crocheting and other needlework to pass their time.
With better medications, there were fewer and fewer cases of tuberculosis reported in Kenton County by the mid 1970s. In 1976, all tuberculosis patients were moved to the second floor of the Sanatorium and the third floor was remodeled and converted into a mental health and comprehensive care facility. The Covington-Kenton County Tuberculosis Sanatorium finally closed its doors in the latter part of 1979, at which time the entire facility was converted to mental heath care. Today, the building has been transformed into the NorthKey Community Care’s Children’s Intensive Services Hospital, serving children with serious mental health issues.",1979,"Covington, KY",,

The original building burned to the ground in 1915 and was immediately rebuilt. Over the years it was added on to and expanded before it ceased to operate as a TB hospital in 1972. At that time it was re-used to house developmentally disabled, most of them non-ambulatory. Hazelwood was a replacement for the ""crib units"" at Frankfort State Hospital. The ""crib units"" were units in which the beds had high rails to prevent patients from falling out. There were usually 2 to 4 of these per room.

In 1924 Leo Marks gave $125,000 to the county to construct and equip new facilities for the hospital, which was renamed in honor of his father, Julius. Fayette County and the state continued to contribute funds. The opening of five state tuberculosis hospitals in 1948 caused the number of patients at Julius Marks to decline. These patients eventually were transferred to other state facilities and in 1961 Julius Marks became a home for the elderly and indigent patients in Fayette County replacing the county infirmary.",,"Lexington, KY",,
Kentucky,London TB Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=London_TB_Hospital,1944,1946,1948,Preserved,Single Building,Fred J. Hartstern,District Five State Tuberculosis Hospital,"On March 17, 1944, Governor Simeon Willis approved the passage of House Bill No. 147 that divided the state into six tuberculosis sanatoria districts, allowed for the construction of sanatoria, and created the Tuberculosis Sanatoria Commission of Kentucky. Government funding provided for the expansion of Louisville’s Hazelwood Sanatorium and the erection of five new 100-bed sanatoria throughout the Commonwealth.
Architect Fred J. Hartstern recommended to the Tuberculosis Sanatoria Commission that London, in Laurel County, be the site of the new District Five State Tuberculosis Hospital. London scored high on a series of factors, including accessibility, population within highway distance, and elevation, and consequently secured the right to house the new tuberculosis hospital. Once the site was chosen, construction of the new sanatorium at London commenced in 1946 and a cornerstone was laid on July 19, 1946 to commemorate
this occasion. Over the next four years, contractors from both locally and out-of-state, specifically Ohio, completed work on the London Tuberculosis Hospital.
The London Tuberculosis Hospital signaled a modern approach to tuberculosis treatment and prevention in Kentucky. Medical Director and Superintendent John S. Wisely gave voice to the optimism and hope instilled in the new sanatorium: “There is every indication that the new hospital program answers an urgent public health need and should play a decisive role in community efforts to achieve adequate control of the disease, perhaps within the next decade.” As a source of community outreach, the London Tuberculosis Hospital hosted meetings for public health nurses in District Five to learn about the operation of the hospital and how to improve relations between the sanatorium and local health departments. These meetings were sponsored by the Kentucky Tuberculosis Association, State Department of Health, and State Tuberculosis Commission.
The arrival of bronchoscopic and surgical clinics at the London Tuberculosis Hospital ensured that patients could receive local consultations rather than journeying to the surgical center at Louisville’s Hazelwood Sanatorium. With the development of local clinics at all sanatoria, the waiting list for surgery was eliminated and patients received surgery immediately upon arrival at Hazelwood. Despite the effort to expand the mission of the hospitals, the twenty-year anniversary of the tuberculosis state sanatoria saw the 112-bed capacity of London Tuberculosis Hospital and its fellow sanatoria underutilized (Tuberculosis Sanatoria Commission 1969-1970 Annual Report). Obsolete by the mid-1970s, the set of
Kentucky Tuberculosis Hospitals were decommissioned as the medical community embraced drug therapy over regimented bedrest in a hospital setting. The Commonwealth’s 1975 Plans for  renovation of T.B. Hospitals successfully closed the sanatoria chapter in Kentucky. Currently open as a government office building.",1975 (as a sanatorium),"London, KY",,

The former sanatorium is significant for its association with Kentucky's public health campaign to eradicate tuberculosis, as detailed in the MPS historic context, ""The Anti-Tuberculosis Movement in Kentucky, 1907 - 1975.""
Although Kentucky formed a tuberculosis commission in 1912, sanatoria largely remained in the hands of local and county organizations for the next three decades. The state's construction of five 100-bed tuberculosis hospitals in the late 1940s marked a transition from smaller county-operated sanatoria to larger modern district hospitals. Plagued for decades by a large percentage of tuberculosis cases, Kentucky sprang into action after World War II health inspections exposed the poor health of its citizens. In 1945, Kentucky initiated a state-wide effort to curtail tuberculosis deaths in the Commonwealth. Aided by the 1940s discovery of the antibiotic streptomycin, the sanatoria offered a modern cure to thousands of TB patients.
The effective triple therapy drug treatment of tuberculosis eventually led to the decommissioning of the tuberculosis hospitals in the mid-1970s. The Madisonville Tuberculosis Hospital illustrates Kentucky's mid-twentieth-century response to the tuberculosis epidemic and is a valuable piece of early modern hospital architecture in the Commonwealth.",,"Madisonville, KY",Art Deco,

The Paris Tuberculosis Sanatorium serviced the region for about 15 years before the threat of the disease finally diminished.
The Paris Tuberculosis Sanatorium complex consisted of six total buildings, including the main hospital building, the laundry/boiler facility, the director’s residence, the nurses’ residence, a staff residence, and a modern maintenance building added to the site after its initial construction.

Kentucky,Pewee Valley Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pewee_Valley_Sanitarium,,,1925,Demolished,Single Building,,Friendship Manor Nursing Home,"The Pewee Valley Sanitarium and Hospital traces its origins to 1919, when some Seventh Day Adventist nurses, trained at the Madison College and Sanitarium, established a small treatment center in Louisville. In 1924, the group, headed up by Mr. and Mrs. J.T. Wheeler, purchased a 50-acre farm in Pewee Valley, once owned by Dr. Augustus W. Kaye. When the Seventh Day Adventists bought the Kaye farm, it included a large, two-story log cabin that was about 100 years old, two tenant houses and a barn. Conditions on the farm were primitive. The cabin had no electric lights and was heated by coal stoves. It was subsequently remodeled to include six patient rooms, treatment rooms and a small operating room. In the fall of 1925, the first patient was admitted and the Pewee Valley Sanitarium & Hospital officially opened its doors. The hospital first specialized in diet, water treatments and service. ​In 1934, when the Kentucky Confederate Home closed its doors, the five remaining veterans were transferred to the Pewee Valley Sanitarium, which received an annual $800 allowance from the state to care for them.
By 1940, the hospital had 40 beds and 22 student nurses in training. In 1950, it was a member of both the American Hospital and Kentucky Hospital associations and had 17 physicians on staff, as well as a chaplain. Twenty-six more beds were added in 1956. In May 1969, Friendship Manor Nursing Home opened on the property.
However, the little hospital, where pioneer female photographer Miss Kate Matthews died on July 5, 1956, Hallie Burge Jacobs died on August 7, 1964, and Miss Mary Gardner Johnston died on July 16, 1966, was not able to compete with the much larger hospitals in Louisville, according to the “History of the Pewee Valley Church of Seventh Day Adventists:
""... Health care was becoming big business and more complicated in their operations. Smaller hospitals found it more and more difficult to compete with larger institutions, with their newer and more expensive and sophisticated equipment and facilities, together with their expanding staffs of specialty-trained physicians and other medical personnel, now within easy access…On March 15, (1975), the struggling little Pewee Valley Hospital, founded and nourished with so much “blood, sweat and tears” was forced to close its doors.”",1975,"Pewee Valley, KY",,
Kentucky,Waverly Hills Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Waverly_Hills_Sanitarium,1910,1924,1926,Preserved,Single Building,,Waverly Hills Sanitorium | Woodhaven Geriatrics Sanitarium,"In 1900, Louisville, Kentucky had the highest tuberculosis death rate in the country. This was due to the fact Louisville is such a low valley area and before development, was basically all swampland and perfect breeding ground for the Tuberculosis bacteria. As with many other towns and cities across the country, hospitals were needed to care for the sick. In 1910, a wooden, two-story hospital with 40 beds opened on one of the highest elevated hills in southern Jefferson County to try and contain this ravaging disease.
Officials soon found that this small hospital was simply too small, as they were soon housing more than 130 cases of tuberculosis. Louisville needed a much larger facility and money began to be raised for its construction. Land was donated and $11 million was used to started construction on the new hospital in 1924.
The hospital, known as Waverly Hills, was opened in 1926 and was considered to be the most advanced tuberculosis hospital in the country. If a patient had any chance of surviving the disease, Waverly Hills was the place to come for treatment. Of course, treatment in those days was primitive at best, meaning that many simply came here to die. In those days, it was believed that the best cure for tuberculosis was plenty of nutritional food, plenty of rest and plenty of fresh air. Many patients came to Waverly and were actually cured and became well enough to once again enter society. For those not as fortunate, Waverly was the last place they ever saw.
In 1961, Waverly Hills Sanatorium was closed because there was no longer a need for a tuberculosis facility. The buildings were reopened in 1962 as Woodhaven Geriatrics Sanitarium.
There have been many tales of patient mistreatment and unusual experiments that have filtered down from the hill over the years. Some have been proven false, while others unfortunately have turned out to be true. Electroshock therapy was widely used, although it was considered to be a very effective treatment in those days. Even today, it has been used with great results but now, as it was then, tragic losses sometimes occurred. During the 1960’s and 1970’s, a time of budget cuts for facilities of this type, there were many well documented cases of horrible conditions and unusual treatments at mental institutions all across the country. Apparently Woodhaven was no different because the state of Kentucky closed it down in 1982 due to patient abuse. The buildings, contents and land were auctioned off and the doors were locked for good.
The building and land changed hands several times over the next 18 years. The second owner of the property wanted to tear all the buildings down to construct the world’s largest statue of Jesus Christ. He succeeded in demolishing all of the buildings except for the main hospital and was only stopped by an injunction because the building is on the National Historic Register’s “endangered” list. He then decided that if he couldn't’t legally tear it down then he would do everything in his power to get it condemned. He let vandals come into the building and tear it up. After breaking windows, porcelain sinks, toilets and doors, they began spraying graffiti on every available wall. The owner then dug around the foundation, in some places as deep as 30 feet, to try and make the foundation crack. If this happened, then he believed he could get the building condemned and would be able to legally tear it down. Fortunately, the structure refused to give way and his efforts failed. The area where his extensive digging took place can still currently be seen.
In 2001 Waverly Hills was sold to current owners Tina and Charlie Mattingly. Charlie's father, who died in 2005, worked as an orderly at Waverly Hills for approximately four years. The Mattinglys currently hold tours of Waverly Hills and convert the building into a haunted house attraction each Halloween. There are also historical tours, ghost tours, as well as overnight investigations available for a fee. Proceeds go toward saving the building and the restoration of the property.
Despite the claims of over 60,000 patient deaths from TB at Waverly Hills throughout it's history, research has shown that the number is more likely closer to 10% (6,000) of that. Extensive research of the number of deaths can be found | HERE

Kentucky,Bullitt County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bullitt_County_Poor_Farm,,,1903,Demolished,,,,"On April 10, 1903, Bullitt County Fiscal Court bought two tracts of land totaling 189 acres from C.L. Croan to be used as a poor farm. The county agreed to pay $5,825.00 at 6% interest paid in four payments the first payment being $2,025.00 cash in hand and one payment of $1,268.00 and two payments of $1,266.00 over a 3-year period. On July 2, 1903, the fiscal court decided that they wanted 2 box houses to be built on the Poor Farm, one for whites and one for coloreds. They opened bids to carpenters for the work. The bid of C.L Croan and J.T. Tucker was accepted. On October 5, 1903, it was ordered that a corn-crib, meat house and a coal house be built on the Poor Farm. It was also ordered that a married man be hired to manage the Poor Farm and that the County Judge, Leroy Daniel, be appointed commissioner of the county poor farm.
The county poor farm would be in operation for the next 50 plus years. Those people who lived on the farm were referred to as inmates and required to work on the farm to earn their keep. If you were an invalid you would not be required to work. Sometimes the unfortunate folks who found themselves there died and, with no family, were buried in the cemetery on the property. The cemetery predates the Poor Farm since it was originally an old family graveyard. Over the years there have been a few poor souls killed on the railroad tracks that were unidentified and listed as John Doe and buried in the Poor Farm Cemetery.
It is unclear when the Poor Farm ended its operations. According to Fiscal Court records, on September 21, 1953, the Poor House was leased out as a boarding house. A little over a year later on December 20, 1954, the tenant was asked to move out. On June 11, 1954, Fiscal Court asked for $8,375.00 for the land on the Poor Farm that the state wants to use for right of way for a toll road. On November 16, 1959, the state of Kentucky pays Bullitt County $4,500.00 for Poor Farm land to be used as right of way for the Kentucky Turnpike on and off ramps. On August 20, 1962, Paul Grubbs, representative of The Bullitt County Chamber of Commerce and owner of Grubbs Development Corporation, approached the Bullitt County Fiscal Court about buying the Poor Farm. Two and half years later Grubbs Development Corporation and the Bullitt County Fiscal Court enter into an agreement to buy the Poor Farm.
Joe Raley apparently lived in the house on the Poor Farm from April 1955 when he started renting and managing until May 15, 1973 when he was asked to vacate the houses. Mr. Raley continued to rent the land only until September 1, 1977. On July 8, 1972 one of the houses was rented out to Mr. and Mrs. Elvin R. Hodge. In March 1973 The State of Kentucky bought additional Poor Farm land from the county for road work. On November 19, 1973 The Fiscal Court ordered the county attorney to regain possession of the house on the poor farm.
Over time the land that was the Bullitt County Poor Farm was leased out by Fiscal Court for various uses. On January 19, 1981 the Bullitt Fiscal Court leased 29.77 acres to the Bullitt County Fair Board for 35 years. On July 16, 1982 Fiscal Court gave Joe Raley permission to dismantle 2 barns on the Bullitt County Poor Farm property and keep the lumber. On July 18, 1983 Bullitt County Fiscal Court leases some of the Bullitt County Poor Farm land to Southeast Fire Department. Another additional 1 acre was leased to the Southeast Bullitt County Fire Department. The Poor House was located at the current location of the Southeast Bullitt Volunteer Fire & Rescue No.2 on Old Highway 245 in Shepherdsville, Kentucky.",1954,"Shepherdsville, KY",,

Kentucky,Franklin County Alms House and Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Franklin_County_Alms_House_and_Poor_Farm,1880s,,1910,Preserved,Single Building,,,"According to a 1975 assessment from the Kentucky Heritage Council, Franklin County Fiscal Court purchased 300 acres and a farmhouse near what is now the Kentucky State University research farm for $15,600 in December 1910. However, a ledger donated to the Capital City Museum shows an “alms house” operated at the location near the Anderson County line as early as 1884. In the 1880s and 1890s, several immigrants such as Irishman “Jimmie the well-digger” and Henry Vanedeu from South America were recorded. During the 20th century, most residents came from Franklin County or central Kentucky – but a few from New Jersey, Tennessee and “Missoura” were reported. Many were reported as infirm, crippled or of “unsound mind” – one resident was discharged in 1893 for stealing watermelons according to the ledger. Others “ran away,” went to an asylum or simply drifted off.
The Great Depression caused the number of residents to grow, and in 1929 several buildings were added to the poor farm, including a dormitory and washhouse. The poor farm closed in 1975 when the last superintendents, Pete and Mae Harrod, retired. There were seven residents left – four men, including John Henry, and three women, according to a story from United Press International in 1975. Henry had lived on the poor farm 33 years, he told reporters. The poor farm was sold and the residents were placed in a nursing home, according to the UPI. While living at the poor farm, residents gave their Social Security checks to the county and were given a $10 monthly allowance, according to the UPI. The men bought chewing tobacco, and the women bought material to make dresses.",1975,"Frankfort, KY",,

The land is located on state Route 42 towards South Charleston, across the road from where Cordle’s Motel is now located. The county didn’t actually purchased the land until June 1866. The house that was standing on the property was the first infirmary. The new structure became operational in January 1872. The building was brick with a stone foundation and stood four stories high. The basement or first story contained 19 rooms. Each of the other stories contained 20 rooms.
The Madison County Infirmary stood until 1956 when it was torn down and the land was sold. The county still owns a small section of the land where the cemetery for the infirmary was located.",1956,"London, OH",,
