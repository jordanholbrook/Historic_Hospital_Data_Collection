Louisiana,Central Louisiana State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_Louisiana_State_Hospital,1902,,1906,Active,Cottage Plan,,Louisiana Hospital for the Insane | Insane Asylum at Alexandria,"In 1902, the Louisiana Legislature created a facility to house and treat the mentally ill. The facility operated under several names since its opening in January 1906, but was later known as Central Louisiana State Hospital. The name of Louisiana Hospital for the Insane of Louisiana is changed to Central Louisiana State Hospital in 1924. At its peak in 1959, the hospital housed over 3,000 patients, but in recent years, patient numbers at Central dwindled to 246 in 1995 to 120 being cared for today. The hospital campus is over 400 acres. The hospital grounds also include the Civil War-era Fort Randolph.
Just one building from a century ago remains, offering a glimpse into a very different version of Central State: the stucco, Renaissance-style Rose Cottage built in 1917. Fittingly, it's become a depository for staff when they find historical photos and items related to Central State, according to administration. The dairy barn (built in 1923) and administration building (built in 1927) are among a few buildings constructed between 75 and 95 years ago.
Today, Central Louisiana State Hospital is a free standing, full service psychiatric hospital licensed by the State of Louisiana, fully accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and certified by the Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS).
Plans were announced by the state in February, 2012, to relocate the hospital to a new facility on land adjacent to Pinecrest Supports and Services Center in Pineville. The hospital will retain its name, identity and function to maintain accreditation. The new building will cost $6 million and will be funded through State of Louisiana Capital Outlay funds. Construction will take 12 to 18 months.
One provision of the original legislation required the hospital board to furnish 
the legislature at each session a detailed report of the annual receipts and 
expenditures, a statistical breakdown of new and current enrollment, and a list 
of those deceased during the previous period.  The first superintendent, Dr. 
George A.B. Hays, immediately set up a morgue and selected a site for a hospital 
cemetery in order to comply with these requirements.
Given the social conditions of the times, the stigma of mental illness, plus the 
difficulty of contacting relatives and arranging transportation of the bodies, it 
was not surprising that many of the deceased patients were buried on the hospital 
grounds in the cemetery.  Until such time as the hospital could obtain the services 
of a Chaplin, the superintendent or some of the staff physicians handled the burial 
services, using the simple and beautiful service of the Methodist Church.
These early funeral services were handled entirely by the hospital, with the body 
being transported to the gravesite in a wheelbarrow until 1933 when a hand-drawn 
hearse was constructed.  This hearse was used until 1950, and was pushed by 
pallbearers to the gravesite.  Deceased female patients were draped in pink or 
blue shrouds made by the workers in the sewing room, and the carpenter shop probably 
furnished coffins (although this is not reflected in their individual reports).
Hospital records indicate there are approximately 3,000 people buried in this 
cemetery, and it was last used in June 1985. A large wooden cross, constructed in the hospital's carpenter shop, was placed 
on the hill in the early 1960's.  A large white solid concrete cross has since 
replaced it.  Hospital workers poured a large concrete slab near the street for 
the placing of grave markers by relatives of the deceased.

The Asylum's Board of Administrators appointed an architect, a Mr. Gibbens. to draw up the plans. He was specifically told not to design something that would look like a prison. Gibbens came up with the design of the Center Building with its wings. The Board of Administrators purchased a 250-acre tract known as ""Flowery Hill"" a short distance from the business section of Jackson, separated from the town by a small stream.
On July 5, 1847, Robert Perry signed a contract with the Board for the building of the Asylum, and President David Shattuck of Centenary College signed as security for Perry. The Board requested that the West Wing be completed by December 1, 1847, but there were delays due to bad weather and the building was not ready for occupancy until the fall of 1848. The East Wing was
not finished until 1849. Center Building was ready for use in 1854, but it was never completed according to Gibbens' plans. The rear of the building was to have extended another hundred feet and to have contained a central kitchen, storerooms, and other facilities. Although the Asylum's early superintendents frequently asked the Legislature for funds to complete Center Building, they were never provided.
The Asylum began accepting patients in 1848. These first patients came from the Insane Department of New Orleans' Charity Hospital and from local jails across the state. The initial staff at the Insane Asylum consisted of twelve people. From 1848 to 1850 there were 130 admissions. By 1898 there were over a thousand patients in residence at the Asylum. In 1922 its name was
changed to East Louisiana State Hospital. Today it has a staff of over a thousand employees, and almost seven hundred patients reside there. The latter figure would be much higher if the hospital's functions had not been divided among several new independent agencies in recent years.
Considered to be one of the largest and most significant Greek Revival buildings in Louisiana, it has been placed on the National Register. The institution was one of the first mental hospitals in the South.

The Service was created by an act of the 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798. It was the first publicly-funded health care and disease prevention federal agency in the country. In New Orleans the federal government created a marine hospital before the United States officially assumed control of the Louisiana Purchase. A flood inundated the hospital's original building on the river's western shore near Algiers, so it was moved to the Jackson Barracks, where it stayed until 1858. A new location on Tchoupitoulas near Children's Hospital was eventually chosen.
Improvements were made on the hospital grounds in 1931, when seven new buildings were constructed, as well as a stable, a laundry, and a service center. Over time, the scope of the hospital's duties expanded and it was renamed the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service and later the Public Health Service. By 1954 the facility became known simply as the United States Public Health Service Hospital. Eventually, federal funding was cut, and in 1981 the state acquired the property. The following year, the site became the State Drug Addiction Center and, in 1983, the New Orleans Adolescent Hospital. In 2009, the hospital was closed to a decline in population for the city of New Orleans and decreased budget.",2009,"New Orleans, LA",,

Louisiana,Southeast Louisiana State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Southeast_Louisiana_State_Hospital,1948,1950,1952,Active,Cottage Plan,,Northlake Behavioral Health System (Current),"Planning for the third psychiatric treatment facility for the State, to be located in the New Orleans area, began in the 1940's. Originally, plans were made to develop the Third Floor of Charity Hospital in New Orleans into a 500-bed psychiatric unit. However, it was felt that a large number of beds were required and space was not available at Charity Hospital. Therefore, the decision was made to build a 2,700 bed hospital, which was thought to be the number of beds required, in Mandeville, LA. Construction of a 400-bed hospital was initiated which would be the first phase of construction. Sometime later, however, with the introduction of Chlorpromazine and the Therapeutic Community Concept, plans to expand the hospital to 2,700 beds were dropped.
In 1948, Senate Bill No. 272 was entered by Messrs. Richardson and Gardiner to create the third hospital of the State of Louisiana for the mentally ill. The bill passed and Southeast Louisiana Hospital was created by Act No. 238 approved by the Governor, July 1, 1948.
Construction of the Adult Services Building, three individual employee residences, a four unit apartment complex and the Boiler Room were begun in 1950 and completed in 1952. The Admission and Diagnostic Building, currently the Administration Building, was also constructed by 1952 complete with an operating room. Only one surgery, a lobotomy, was performed here before the surgery suite was permanently closed.
Hospital opened to employees on October 6, 1952 and received its first client on December 8, 1952; a 22 year old white female admitted on a court commitment from Orleans Parish, with a diagnosis of Schizophrenic Reaction, Chronic Undifferentiated. Additional employee housing was constructed in 1954, 1960 and 1962. In 1955 the Laundry building was added; in 1956 Automotive Maintenance building and in 1961 Warehouse and Maintenance Offices.
The Receiving Building and Adolescent Units were constructed in 1955. In 1959 the Adolescent Services opened with 84 beds which included a school operated under the Department of Education, Special School District #1. That same year, children ages 5 to 14 years were admitted to a small 25 bed unit. The children also received services from Special School District #1. In 1955 construction began on the Alcoholism Treatment Service and opened to received patients in 1960 with a bed capacity of 60.
In 1970/71 a new children's complex was opened, increasing bed capacity to 83. The complex includes a Recreation Building and Gymnasium. In 1970, a volunteer program, the Thomas L. Young Auxiliary, was organized and continues to provide a variety of services to the people the hospital serves as well as funds for various projects and activities which are not funded through SELH budget appropriation.
In 1972, a Vocational Rehabilitation Unit was added, a joint venture of the Vocational Rehabilitation Department and the hospital. The hospital provided 30 inpatient beds, formerly the 25-bed children's unit, and staff, while V.R. provided personnel and equipment for the education, desensitization and placement of patients in work or training situations.
In 1982 a new seventy-four bed adolescent complex was opened which included a new Adolescent School and School Administration Building. The old Adolescent Unit was closed and not used for several years until renovation was completed in 1986/87. On June 24, 1992 a portion of the old adolescent unit was opened as a twenty bed brief stay adolescent unit named New Hope. The average length of stay was 41 days. But, in March of 1997 the New Hope program was converted to an acute care adolescent unit with a length of stay under twenty-one (21) days.
In July of 1992 the Alcohol and Drug Unit (formerly ATS, Alcoholism Treatment Services) was transferred to the management of DHH, Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse, but remains housed at SELH. October of 1992, an eighteen (18) bed Adult Acute Psychiatric Unit, staffed and managed by SELH, opened at Washington/St. Tammany Regional Medical Center in Bogalusa, LA. Serving the residents of Region IX, it is a tri-agency partnership, e.g., SELH, Region IX Community Mental Health Services and LSU/HCSD.
On March 29, 1993, SELH converted two of the five adolescent wards into a twenty-five bed Developmental Neuropsychiatric Program (DNP) for adolescent patients with a dual diagnosis of mental illness and developmental disability. The remaining three adolescent wards served forty eight adolescent patients. The thirty (30) adult Vocational Rehabilitation inpatient beds were transferred to the management of Louisiana Rehabilitation Services (LRS) on December 12, 1994. Included in the transfer were the twelve (12) positions assigned to the thirty bed unit.[1]
Under new ownership Southeast Louisiana State Hospital has become what is known today as, Northlake Behavioral Health System.
Today, Northlake Behavioral Health System remains the largest behavioral health institution in Louisiana. In 2016, Northlake became a 501(c)(3) not for profit hospital with a mission to provide quality services to individuals with mental and behavioral concerns. The hospital and its caring team of professionals are valued members of the community, who prioritize giving back through different partnerships and organizations. Northlake is a teaching hospital that provides Louisiana medical and clinical professionals an active and supportive teaching environment.

The Colony was established to meet a need pointed up for many years by the East Louisiana State Hospital and by the Central Louisiana State Hospital when these institutions, existing to provide care and treatment for mentally ill persons, found that their populations included an increasing number of mentally defective and epileptic persons who were not mentally ill.

Today, the girls’ program is housed at Ware Youth Center in Coushatta, Red River Parish, which contracts with OJJ to provide services for girls in a newly-constructed state-of-the-art facility.",1989,"Ball, LA",,

Louisiana,G. B. Cooley Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=G._B._Cooley_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,,1935,1937,Active,Single Building,,G.B. Cooley Hospital | G.B. Cooley Services for Persons with Developmental Needs,"The G. B. Cooley Tuberculosis sanatorium was constructed by the Works Progress Administration. It was located at Pine Top, seven miles from Monroe, Louisiana, or at White’s Ferry, 3 1/2 miles from Monroe, depending on source. The WPA provided $66,303 and the community and Tuberculosis and Public Health Association raised the remaining $10,000 for the project. The sanatorium was spearheaded by efforts of Captain G. B. Cooley of Monroe. The central structure was two stories with one-story wings on each side, approximately 7,000 square feet. The wings contained 11 bedrooms on each side, with one wing for men and one for women. Work began November 4, 1935, and about 85 men were employed on the project.

Louisiana,John Dibert Tuberculosis Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=John_Dibert_Tuberculosis_Hospital,1926,,1936,Closed,Single Building,,,"The John Dibert Tuberculosis Hospital was built in 1936 in New Orleans. It was founded by Eve Dibert, in memory of her husband and at a cost of $450,692.26. A 1926 report describes the building:
""This modern, up-to-date building of two hundred and fifty bed capacity, is a complete hospital unit, fully equipped and capable of caring for, in an efficient manner, the unfortunates who are afflicted with that malady. There is no separate X-Ray unit, but the building is so wired that a portable machine can take pictures of all who are unable to be transported to the Main Laboratory. There is a complete operating room, dental rooms and pathological laboratory that will serve only the patients in that department. A complete kitchen, costing in the neighborhood of $9,000.00, makes it possible to segregate that building from all others. The entire equipment will cost about $25,000.00. This low figure was made possible by competitive bids on every article furnished. It is intended to keep the cost of maintenance entirely separate from the rest of the hospital."" [1]
The building was erected as part of an already existing hospital complex. The same report details a series of tunnels that were constructed for patients and doctors to move freely about the complex buildings:
""Plans and specifications have been completed for the building of an underground tunnel from the Dibert Building to the space between the Delgado and Milliken Buildings, also, a branch to the Nurses' Home. It is hoped funds will soon be available for this improvement, as such a tunnel would prove of real service to patients and others going to these buildings. Later, connections could be made with the new unit and other buildings that may be constructed in the future. The covered passage from the entrance on Tulane Avenue to the Main Building, connecting the two administration buildings, has been completed.""",,"New Orleans, LA",,250
Louisiana,Fenwick Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fenwick_Sanitarium,,,1899,Closed,Single Building,,Palms Hospital,"After relocating from Abbeville to Covington, Dr. F.F. Young built a sanitarium in Covington, and over the years it moved from one location to another. The Southern Hotel was used for a time, as was ""Glen Cottage"" and a couple of new buildings. Fire destroyed two of his facilities. “The New Fenwick Sanitarium,” billed as one of the finest institutions in the South, was moved to Covington for several reasons. The Covington/Abita Springs area already had an established reputation for health-recuperating qualities, due to the air and water. The ""Ozone Belt"" was known world-wide for its resistance to recent health epidemics.
According to a 1910 booklet about Covington, the Glen Cottage was one of the most popular and successful select private resorts at Covington. The house was a new building with all of the modern improvements. Every room opened onto broad galleries.  Glen Cottage was noted for its home comforts, French cookery and its out door recreations which included basketball, a tennis court, etc. The house was open from March to November, and was situated on the edge of Covington in one of the most picturesque of locations.
In 1925 the Fenwick Sanitarium then in use burned to the ground. Labelled ""the most disastrous fire Covington has had for some time,"" an article in the Farmer stated that the fire occurred just before noon on Saturday, April 11. It was discovered while all the residents had gathered for dinner and ""by the time the alarm was given it had gained such headway that it could not be subdued."" Only part of the furniture on the ground floor was saved. ""The Fenwick Sanitarium was considered to be one of the best in the South. It is not known just what arrangements will be made for its reconstruction or its new quarters. The patients are at this time being cared for at various quarters, as could best be arranged,"" according to the article.
In 1935, the Fenwick Sanitarium was renovated and became the Palms Hospital with forty private patient rooms. Each room had a lavatory, a brass bed and a mirrored dresser. Majestic stained glass transom and cut glass front door gave the Palms Hospital a look of distinction. A group of physicians purchased the Palms Hospital in 1945, and operated the hospital for more than twenty years. It was converted to residential apartments in 1974.",1965,"Covington, LA",,
