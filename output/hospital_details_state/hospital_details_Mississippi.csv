The facility was located on Highway 49, three miles North of Magee, Mississippi. Dr. Henry Boswell was the first Superintendent of the Sanatorium and remained so for the next forty years.
The Sanatorium originally housed all the Caucasian patients in the “white infirmary” and all the African-American patients in the “black infirmary.” This changed, when on April 21, 1968, The Mississippi State Board of Health insisted that all health facilities comply with the civil rights legislation. The Sanatorium continued to be a forerunner in providing treatment to Tuberculosis patients. Other facilities eventually opened up in neighboring areas.

Mississippi,East Mississippi State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=East_Mississippi_State_Hospital,"March 8, 1882",1882,January 1885,Active,(original) Single Building (current)Cottage Plan,,East Mississippi State Insane Asylum,"On March 8, 1882, the Mississippi State Legislature approved enabling legislation to establish the East Mississippi State Insane Asylum. This came about largely due to the efforts of Miss Dorothea Dix, a champion for mentally ill in the United States. The city of Meridian purchased and donated 560 acres of land for the construction of the facility. The asylum opened its doors for service in January of 1885, with a 19 year old man from Meridian as the first patient.
In the years 1893 and 1894, three native magnolia trees and three Japanese magnolia trees were planted in front of the Administration Building. These trees make a beautiful entrance to the hospital even today.
The original structure was three stories and built on the Kirkbride plan. The administration was in the center with two wings consisting of three wards each. The capacity of this building was 250 patients. Since then, the campus had been develpoped on the Cottage plan and by 1916 in addition to the original building there were six cottages, and Tuberculosis building, and a building for treating the acute sick.
The name of the institution was changed from East Mississippi State Insane Asylum to East Mississippi Insane Hospital in 1898, and finally to East Mississippi State Hospital in the early 1930's, perhaps reflecting changes in attitudes toward the mentally ill nationwide.
During the early years the hospital was almost self sufficient with farming facilities, a hog farm, a cattle farm, a dairy barn, a poultry plant, and orchards of peach, apple, pear and pecan trees. A canning plant was built to process the produce.
In the mid 1950's the hospital realized much progress toward becoming a modern psychiatric hospital. Since its beginning the hospital had provided for only custodial purposes but during the 1950's it began to develop treatment services for the patients. With adequate and well-trained medical and psychiatric staff, the various kinds of therapies and the use of tranquilizing drugs were instituted. The hospital began to be recognized as a successful treatment center of psychiatric illness. It was also during this period that much improvement was made in the physical structures. The Administration Building was remodeled to modern standards and a new occupational therapy building, recreation building, and a new employee dormitory were constructed.
During the 1960's the admission rate for adolescent patients increased and the hospital began providing active treatment to younger residents of the state. It was also during this period that one of the buildings was converted into a skilled level nursing facility in order to provide nursing home services for those patients who no longer required psychiatric care but were in need of more medical and nursing services. This decade saw an increase in the number of admissions to state hospitals, but a decrease in the number of long-term patients as community based programs developed statewide.
An Alcohol Rehabilitation Center was established and a 96-bed intermediate nursing facility was licensed during the 1970's. To further in-service education by providing opportunities for employee training and advancement, the hospital established a series of courses to better prepare the psychiatric direct care workers for their duties. A deinstitutionalization program was reinstated with special emphasis on discharge planning and treatment programs. A halfway house was established in the community to provide former patients the opportunities to develop and exercise independent living skills.
During the 1980's the treatment team model was implemented and a unit to prepare long-term residents for discharge was developed. EMSH saw the development of the unit based treatment model which provided patients with an active treatment intervention to facilitate return to the community and to reduce the number of patients in extended treatment services. The Case Management System, Respite Program to divert admissions, and the Friendship Center were developed to provide psychosocial community based day treatment. Programming was expanded in existing community programs and efforts were made to promote community awareness and support. Group homes were established and supervised apartments became available to provide alternative living arrangements for former patients.
The 1990's brought an expansion of the parameters of patient care. Additional full-time staff was secured to offer a broader spectrum of services to the patients. Affiliations with medical hospitals and consultant physicians were added to the range of medical services available. All these changes improved the staff-patient ratio.
Education of staff was emphasized. Continuing in-service education was mandated for medical and other professionals and an academic linkage agreement was established with state colleges and universities to provide supervised clinical experiences for students.
In 1993, one of the hospital buildings was renovated to meet nursing home requirements and opened as Reginald P. White Nursing Facility 303. The EMSH adolescent school was officially named Magnolia Grove School and organized as a separate department with the appointment of a chief administrative officer. An internal school board was appointed to serve as governing body. In July of 1995, Magnolia Grove School completed all requirements to be certified as a Special School with full accreditation from the State Department of Education.
Opening of new facilities have marked the beginning of the twenty-first century. Two new group homes were opened in DeKalb?, MS in August 2001. These homes provide residence for ten men and ten women in a homelike setting.
The Bradley A. Sanders Adolescent Complex was dedicated April 18, 2002. Named after a longtime Department of Mental Health employee, the 50-bed complex was built on 63 acres of land near the hospital's main campus to replace the existing adolescent unit located in one of the hospital's older buildings.
A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 20, 2003, for construction of a new R.P. White Nursing Facility. It will be a state-of-the-art facility consisting of two 120-bed single story buildings which are being built on a beautiful eighteen-acre tract of EMSH property located in northwest Lauderdale County off Old Eighth Street Road. The new facility opened on 16 March 2006.
The city of Meridian, which seemed distant from the hospital a century ago, has surrounded the hospital; and today East Mississippi State Hospital is part of a growing area of schools, recreational areas, and special support services for the community. Except for services to the severely physically ill, EMSH provides inpatient services for adults and adolescents requiring psychiatric or substance abuse treatment as well as nursing home services. In addition, the hospital operates a continuum of community based services such as training center, halfway house, group homes, supervised apartments and a psychosocial center.
The future of East Mississippi State Hospital seems bright for the staff but brighter still for the citizens of Mississippi who are in need of the unique services the hospital offers.[1]
The cemetery is located at the far end of 22nd Street about two blocks from the hospital campus.  There is no parking except directly in front of the locked gate, in the street. As of 2017 it is kept neatly.  The more recent markers are at the far end of the cemetery on the right hand side, below a gravel drive.  The oldest appear to be on the left hand side and over the rise of the hill.  Not all markers are in place - having been disturbed and strewn about.  The oldest markers lie flush with the ground and each bears only the decedent's hospital number.  About half of the markers are newer granite blocks that rise about four inches from the ground and bear name and dates.  There are a handful of markers that appear to have been erected by families.  The cemetery listing on Find a Grave is incomplete.

Mississippi,Kuhn Memorial State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kuhn_Memorial_State_Hospital,,,1832,Closed,Single Building,,Vicksburg City Hospital | Kuhn State Hospital,"Kuhn State Hospital started life as Vicksburg’s City Hospital back in 1832, in response to a smallpox outbreak. It took its place at this location, then a suburban estate with “a substantial house” in 1847. Run by Dr. George K. Birchett, and later his son, grandson, and great-grandson, the hospital served wounded during the Civil War and suffered the deaths of 16 doctors and 6 Catholic Sisters of Mercy during the Yellow Fever of 1878. The state took over the operation of the hospital in 1871, and the institution was re-named the State Charity Hospital at Vicksburg.
Confederate veterans stalked the halls of a specially built annex, constructed in 1901 (burned in a “mysterious fire” in 1918). And to top it off, the University of Mississippi operated its first medical school here in the academic year 1910-11.
In 1954, a former resident of Vicksburg, Lee Kuhn, having long since moved to New York City, died and left his estate of $400,000 to the Vicksburg Charity Hospital. In his will, Kuhn directed that a 7-person committee composed of three Jews, two Catholics, and two Protestants be formed to decide the best way to disburse the money. The committee decided that a new building would be the best use, and in 1959, the institution opened a large new facility to the rear of the original buildings. The institution was also renamed in honor of Mr. Kuhn. Changes in medicine and mission brought about yet another large building in 1962, this one replacing the antebellum “substantial house” and its 1909 annex with the brick building that greets a visitor today. Probably both the 1959 and the 1962 buildings were designed by Raymond Birchett, Vicksburg architect and great-grandson of the original Dr. Birchett.
The Kuhn closed in 1989, a victim of state politics and funding issues.
Since its closure, the facility fell victim to vandals and thrill-seekers which resulted in the rapid decay of the hospital.
In 2015, paranormal investigators discovered the body of a victim who had been murdered. This incident brought more negative publicity to the facility and helped speed up calls to demolish the property. 
Demolition on the historic hospital began in February of 2019, and the site is now a vacant lot.",1989,"Vicksburg,MS",,

Mississippi,Mississippi State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mississippi_State_Hospital,1848,1850,1856,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),,Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum | Mississippi State Insane Hospital | Jackson State Hospital | Whitfield State Hospital,"Governor AG Brown made the first public proposition to establish a hospital for the insane in 1846. In 1848, the Mississippi Legislature appropriated funds for the original facility, which opened in 1856 at the present site of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. The institution became a highly contested site during the Civil War. Under the direction of General William T. Sherman, the Union Army ransacked the institution during the early stages of the occupation of Jackson in July 1863. Union soldiers plundered the storeroom and garden, and slaughtered numerous livestock. Making matters worse, seven of institution’s ten employees left their jobs and joined the Union Army.
Two notable developments occurred at the institution during Reconstruction. The institution began admitting black patients in 1870. Indications show that black and white patients resided in neighboring wards in the same buildings for a majority of the institution’s 85-year operation. Secondly, in 1871, the state legislature mandated weekly visits to the institution by its trustees. Such a mandate shows its usefulness in the institution’s yearly death rate of roughly 21 per year during most of Reconstruction. Due to the lack of upkeep and lack of funding, Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum became dilapidated during the late-19th century. Until 1894, the institution relied on coal oil lamps and candles for lighting, and a local pond for water. In 1892, a fire broke out that destroyed two-thirds of the institution’s major building and claimed one patient’s life. Spurred by this devastating fire, the state legislature appropriated funds to begin having electric light fixtures installed throughout the institution in 1894.
In 1900, the name of the hospital was changed from ""Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum"" to ""Mississippi State Insane Hospital."" In 1935, the psychiatric hospital was moved to the community of Howell which was then the site of the state penal colony. Located near the current towns of Brandon, the area was renamed ""Whitfield"" in honor of Gov. Henry L Whitfield. After the First World War, two separate events affected the institution. First, a separate institution for the feeble-minded opened in 1921. The Mississippi School and Colony for the Feeble-Minded removed children deemed feeble-minded from the state’s two mental institutions and society in general. Second, Mississippi enacted a compulsory sterilization law in the wake of the Buck v. Bell ruling in 1928. In 1933, the institution’s superintendent, Dr. C.D. Mitchell, “hoped that in the future every patient who comes to the institution…be sterilized in order to lessen the mental disorders which will be handed down to future generations”.[1]
Beginning in the late-1920s, plans to construct a new state mental institution began to take shape. Appropriated by the Mississippi State Legislature in 1926 and opened on March 4, 1935, the Mississippi State Hospital—under the direction of superintendent Dr. C.D. Mitchell—replaced the exceedingly dated 80-year-old Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum. [2] When it opened on March 4, 1935, the main hospital and buildings covered the 350 acres it presently occupies. The remainder of the 3,333-acre tract was devoted to general farming, dairying, pastures, orchards and truck farms (i.e., vegetable fields) during the early and mid-1900s. Seventy of the more than 100 buildings on campus were constructed between 1926 and 1935. They were built along a cottage type plan in a colonial design with red brick and white columns and trim. Some were built with a cupola on top. The last original cupola still sits atop the administration building and has become the logo for the hospital.[3]

Mississippi,Ellisville State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ellisville_State_School,,,1921,Active,Cottage Plan,,Mississippi School and Colony for the Feeble-Minded,"In 1920, Governor Lee Russell signed the “Law of Mental Deficiency” establishing the “Mississippi School and Colony for the Feebleminded.” A site south of Ellisville, Mississippi was selected and the institution was opened in January of 1921. The original “colony” consisted of eight individuals who were transferred from Mississippi State Hospital. The original building on campus was a wood-frame commissary that was previously used by an area lumber company.
In 1922 a farmhouse was remodeled for individuals and a small hospital cottage was erected. The first school opened on campus that same year, with 20 of the 80 individuals on campus attending classes. The individuals also worked in the houses and laundry, as well as, the farm and garden areas. The population increased to 102 - all males - by 1923. Females were not allowed admission because no facilities were available to house them at that time. The first female dormitory was constructed in 1928 and by 1929 the population had increased to 239 with 51 males and 88 females.
In 1929, the name of the facility was changed to Ellisville State School. That was the year of the stock market crash. More than 150 individuals at Ellisville State School were released due to the budget deficit. However, by 1931 the population had grown to 319. Financial problems in 1933 saw the population drop to 269 as employees were discharged. Employees who stayed received a 50%-60% salary cut. After that, the population slowly began to increase and was back up to approximately 386 in 1941.
In 1961 Ellisville State School, along with the Department of Education, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, used funds under the federal Hill-Burton Act to construct a rehabilitation facility on the campus. This program was jointly operated by the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation and Ellisville State School. This new program provided training opportunities and vocational placement services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities throughout the state and established vocational training as a priority at Ellisville State School.
In the early 1970's Ellisville State School applied for and received millions of dollars in federal grant money to establish needed programs and services. By 1974 approximately 1,500 individuals resided at Ellisville State School which had a staff population of only about 500. During the next several years the “deinstitutionalization program” called for the establishment of community based apartments and group homes. In addition, regional facilities were opened across Mississippi. These facilities accepted individuals from Ellisville State School whose families lived near the newer facilities.
In 1992 the first ICF/MR (Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded) licensed community home opened in Ellisville and housed ten females. The first Special Touch Training Center also opened at this time to provide vocational training to the individuals living in the community home. Over the next few years a total of sixteen additional ICF/MR licensed community homes were constructed in Ellisville, Waynesboro, Taylorsville, Sumrall, Richton, Prentiss, Columbus, Lumberton, and Bay Springs.
In 1995 the Home and Community Based Waiver Program was initiated for persons in their homes who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, provided they are Medicaid eligible and require a level of care similar to that received in an ICF/MR setting.
During the past few decades the population on the main campus has decreased as more individuals moved to community living arrangements and programs were established to provide services in the home. Ellisville State School currently serves individuals living in twenty-three community homes and one supervised apartment complex. Today, approximately 450 individuals reside on Ellisville State School’s main campus while over 1,000 are served through community services. The facility employs approximately 1,600 employees.",,"Ellisville, MS",,

E. 
Norwood on January 13, 1916. This bill was signed into law by Governor Theodore G. Bilbo on March 28, 1916. The purpose of the 
school was to ""train delinquent boys and girls who could not properly be dealt with at home or in the public schools"". Under 
the provisions of this act, destitute and abandoned children were also admitted to the school.
The citizens of Marion County donated a 3,100 acre tract of farm land, some of which could be used for timber production, and gave an additional $50,000.00 to help establish the school. The school opened in 1918. The Superintendent's Home is the only 
major building at the school to survive from its beginning. The majority of the original buildings were demolished in the 1960s 
and 1970s and replaced with new buildings.

The hospital has roots in the Sisters of Mercy, who brought education and healthcare services to the Vicksburg area starting in the 1860s.
Mary Sales Brown lead the Sisters of Mercy to Vicksburg in 1860, where they established a school. This new school brought education to the area which had no formal schools. However, the school would be closed during the Civil War, for the Sisters abandoned it to avoid danger from the war. They returned and nursed wounded soldiers. Then, in 1864, another school was established. During an 1878 outbreak of yellow fever, the Sisters assisted the city hospital where they provided nursing care.
In 1943, the Sisters assumed control of a hospital and now renamed it ""Mercy Hospital."" Under this new name, the hospital would serve the city for 50 years. A new building was erected in 1957 and was considered a state-of-the-art facility at the time of it's construction.
A 1957 article from the Vicksburg Evening Post describes the new facility:
The hospital proper is divided into nine parts. These include the Administration, Adjunct Facilities, including Pathology, Radio and X-Ray Therapy, Hydro Therapy, Electro Therapy, Pharmacy, Nursing Facilities, Nursery, Formula Preparation, Surgical Department, Obstetrics, Emergency Service Facilities.
The Administration suite is adjacent to the main front entrance. It connect to the walk leading to the chapel, and nursing school. Space is provided for main lobby and waiting rooms, admitting office, Social services office, Information, PBX and tube room. Administrator, Secretary Director of Nurses, Director of Nurses, Director of Nursing Service, Director of Personnel, Purchasing office, Business office, Bookkeeping and Insurance offices, Business machines office, Record room, Staff lounge, Chaplain’s office, and Reference library is on the top floor.

The hospital was sold in 1991 to Quorum Healthcare and the facility was renamed the ""Parkview Regional Medical Center."" It operated there for the next decade before shuddering in 2002.
The seven-story, 330,000 square feet complex was listed for sale in 2017 at the price of 2.1 million dollars.
