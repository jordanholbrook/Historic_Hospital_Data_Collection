New York,Binghamton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Binghamton_State_Hospital,,,1858,Preserved,Cottage Plan,Isaac G. Perry,Greater Binghamton Health Center (Current) | New York State Inebriate Asylum | Binghamton Asylum for the Chronic Insane | Binghamton State Hospital | Binghamton Inebriate Asylum | Binghamton Psychiatric Center,"Built in 1858, the castle originally served as the country's first inebriate asylum. Founder J. Edward Turner belonged to a school of thought that alcoholism wasn't just a vice, but could be cured medically. The well-lit rooms and extensive grounds are an important marker in New York State's view of addiction. The asylum was the first of its kind in the country, but only served its original purpose for 15 years, at which point Turner's inebriate asylum was converted into a hospital for the chronically insane. The asylum faced financial woes for a decade after a great fire broke out in March 1870. Gov. Lucius Robinson deemed it a “complete failure” in 1879, suggesting that the asylum be closed down and renovated to house the insane. In 1881, its doors were reopened as the Binghamton Asylum for the Chronic Insane, later renamed the Binghamton State Hospital. Hundreds of patients were transferred to Binghamton from Utica, Poughkeepsie and Middletown; those patients lived, suffered and died in the palatial asylum. Treatment methods only worsened with the turn of the century.
The hospital fell into steep decline in the late 1900s with the introduction of modern medicinal treatments, until it finally closed its doors in 1993. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997.

The Campus was renamed as the Bronx Psychiatric Center while the children's hospital became the New York City Children’s Center. Along with the two main buildings, the institution grew to include numerous out-patient programs along with associated buildings.
In 2008, the center began construction on a set of new buildings to replace the outdated main structures. This new 436,310-square-foot facility features modern amenities for the 156-bed Bronx Psychiatric Center, the 86-bed New York City Children’s Center- Bronx Campus, and an expanded 188-bed residential village providing transitional and supported housing to adults with behavioral health issues.

New York,Brooklyn State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brooklyn_State_Hospital,,1852,1856,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Original),,Flatbush Insane Asylum | Kings County Asylum | Kings County Lunatic Asylum | Long Island State Hospital | Kingsboro State Hospital | Kingsboro Psychiatric Center,"The main building of Kings County Lunatic Asylum, located in Flatbush, was funded by Chapter 278 of the Laws of 1852, which authorized Kings County to negotiate a loan for the extension of hospital accommodations for care of the insane in connection with its almshouse. A further authorization, made by Chapter 255 of the Laws of 1853, provided for a loan to complete the institution under construction. This amount proved insufficient and an additional loan was authorized by Chapter 927 of the Laws of 1855.
The building as originally planned was to consist of an administration building and four wings, but when it opened only two wings had been erected. The institution received its first patients in April 1854; by the end of the first month of operation it was caring for 178 patients. The demand for more room for patients necessitated an enlargement, and four additional wings were built, two on either side of the original main building. The first two were occupied by patients on June 1, 1861, and the latter two on July 1, 1869. To make room for more patients, a building originally erected on the almshouse grounds as a nursery was remodeled for asylum use; 267 patients were subsequently transferred there. Known as the ""Hospital for Incurables,"" it functioned as a separate institution until May 1884, when it became part of the main asylum.
In February 1882, a fire occurred in the main building and destroyed the rear portion of the easterly end of the men's wards. After repair the building was used without extensive modifications until 1911, when the electric wiring and plumbing were renewed and fireproof stairways and steel ceilings were installed.
In 1885, a farm was purchased at St. Johnland (on the northern side of Long Island about 40 miles from the city of Brooklyn) as a site for a branch institution to relieve the overcrowding at Flatbush. This branch later developed into the Kings Park State Hospital. Transfer of patients to the branch began in the fall of 1885. The two institutions were under one management until 1900.
Kings County Lunatic Asylum became the Long Island State Hospital and was transferred to the state by the county on July 1, 1895. In 1900, the St. Johnland branch was given separate management and became Long Island State Hospital at Kings Park; the main part of the institution became Long Island State Hospital at Flatbush (Laws of 1900, Chapter 634). In 1916, Long Island State Hospital at Kings Park was renamed Kings Park State Hospital; Long Island State Hospital at Flatbush was renamed Brooklyn State Hospital.
In May 1916, ground was broken on the Brooklyn site for a reception hospital for 150 patients, and for a building for continued treatment cases to accommodate 400 people. These buildings were completed and open to use in 1919. That same year a contract was let for the construction of another building for continued treatment cases with a capacity of 400 people. The building was completed and occupied in 1921. In 1974, Brooklyn State Hospital was renamed Brooklyn Psychiatric Center. In 1975, it was renamed again to Kingsboro Psychiatric Center.
Brooklyn State Hospital is under the jurisdiction of the State Department of Mental Hygiene. It takes nervous and mental cases from Kings County. The institution has 2,725 beds with complete facilities for observation care, and treatment. The Brooklyn State Hospital was opened in 1895, taking over some of the functions handled by the Kings County Hospital. During the past twenty years all the old buildings have been replaced by fireproof modern structures. The hospital grounds cover twenty-eight acres, and around the nineteen-story central building, opened in 1935, are grouped a number of ward and service buildings. Additions now being constructed will increase the bed capacity to 3,250.

New York,Buffalo State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Buffalo_State_Hospital,,1870,1880,Active and Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Henry Hobson Richardson,"Buffalo Psychiatric Center,  | Buffalo State Lunatic Asylum,  | H.H. Richardson Complex,  | Buffalo State Asylum for the Insane,  | Richardson Olmsted Complex","The Henry Hobson Richardson Complex, or the Buffalo State Asylum for the Insane, as it was originally called, started construction in 1870 and was completed almost 20 years later. It was a state-of-the-art facility when it was built, incorporating the most modern ideas in psychiatric treatment. The design of the buildings as well as the restorative grounds, designed by famed landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, were intended to complement the innovations in psychiatric care practiced at this facility.
At the time Richardson was commissioned to design the complex he was still relatively unknown, but he was later to become the first American architect to achieve international fame. The complex was ultimately the largest building of his career and the first to display his characteristic style - what came to be known as Richardsonian Romanesque – and is internationally regarded as one of the best examples of its kind. Among many others, his genius also yielded the New York State Capital, the Albany City Hall, Trinity Church in Boston, and the Glessner House in Chicago.
The complex and grounds were originally built on 203 acres of largely undeveloped farmland. The V-shaped design consisted of the central tower building with five buildings flanking on each side, connected by curved corridors, branching out in a “flock of geese” formation. This design was representative of what was then known as the Kirkbride system, named after the physician who developed it. As a stage of development in the classification and treatment of mental illnesses, Kirkbride’s system was designed with a central administration building flanked by patient wards in a V-formation. This enabled patients to be gathered according to the type and level of their illness. Rooms were arranged along both sides of the corridor and the buildings were designed for maximum light, ventilation, and privacy, and a home like atmosphere.
The central tower building and adjacent buildings were constructed using Medina Sandstone quarried in nearby Orleans County. The wings were constructed with brick.
A plan for laying out the grounds was prepared by Olmsted and partially completed. Olmsted’s paths and arrangement of spaces were designed to facilitate the activities and philosophy underlying the Kirkbride system. Calvert Vaux, also a landscape architect and collaborator with Olmsted, contributed to the final layout.
The final landscape design laid out the front side of the grounds as a park-style open space, ringed by winding walkways. It was thought that the park-like setting with spacious tree-shaded lawns would have a calming and therapeutic effect on the patients. The grounds behind the hospital buildings were the site of a large, 100-acre farm which extended to the rear boundary of the grounds at the Scajaquada Creek. These farmlands served to provide patients with constructive outdoor physical work in the form of farming, believing that purposeful physical labor would contribute to increasing the patients’ healing and general well-being.
Treatment for people with mental illness continued in the Complex until the late 1990’s. The new Strozzi Building of the Buffalo Psychiatric Center was built east of the historic complex in 1965. Over time services and administrative offices were moved out of the historic complex and into the new facilities, where they continue. In 1997, after completing an extensive statewide Master Plan, the NYS Office of Mental Health announced its intention to divest itself of several psychiatric hospital sites, including the old Buffalo Psychiatric Hospital.
Sections of the Richardson Complex were demolished and the buildings gradually deteriorated. In 1969 the three brick buildings on the east wing were demolished to make room for an adolescent treatment facility. The entire complex of buildings was abandoned and, left uncared for by the State of NY, allowed to deteriorate.
In previous studies, as well as the most recent one, numerous reuse options were evaluated but none were implemented. Among the options studied were: research incubator educational park; office or residential uses; arts center with various galleries, studios, etc.; and senior assisted living housing and the consolidation of Buffalo Public School’s Olmsted Schools.
The complex is internationally regarded as one of architecture’s great treasures. In 1973 it was added to the State and National Registers of Historic Places, and in 1986 it was registered as a National Historic Landmark – one of only seven such sites in Western New York - and is listed on the National Trust’s list of twelve nationwide ""sites to save"" and the Preservation League’s statewide list of seven ""sites to save.""

New York,Central Islip State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_Islip_State_Hospital,,,1887/1896,Closed,Cottage Plan,William E. Hauugaard,Manhattan State Hospital | Central Islip Psychiatric Center,"The Central Islip Psychiatric Center started out as a Farm Colony for New York City in 1889. The patients were transferred from the crowded city asylums on Wards, Hart, and Blackwell Island.
Eventually the asylum was taken over by the state and was renamed the Manhattan State Hospital. The campus consisted of 1000 acres and was the largest asylum by land area. Over 100 buildings were built, 2 of which were quite unique. One being several ward groups connected by corridors that stretched approximately one mile long. The elegant architecture and length of the building led to its name as the ""String of Pearls."" The other complex with a unique layout was called the ""Sunburst,"" which resembled a spoked wheel - the spokes were treatment wards connected to a central hub, with a curved, circular corridor connecting them all. A fire department with 10 employees was created in 1907, and a large medical building and a secure unit were constructed in the middle of the century.
Therapy consisted in working in the farms or one of the many shops. The center had two rail spurs to serve the main power plant (north colony) and the string of pearls (south colony) and even had its own steam engine. Visitors would also arrive by train and the hospital had its own passenger station. The hospital, later renamed to Central Islip State Hospital and finally known as Central Islip Psychiatric Center, began to become severely overcrowded through the 1950s. It reached its peak population of about 10,000 patients in 1955. Lobotomies, various types of shock treatments, and finally drug therapy replaced the long-gone treatments from the 19th century. The population dwindled in the 1970s and 1980s as de-institutionalization took hold, until it finally closed in 1996. The beautiful String of Pearls was demolished for the shopping mall that now stands in its place, the large 1953 power plant was imploded for condominiums in 2006, and the large secure treatment building called Corcoran together with the wooden 1907 firehouse were demolished in 2008. A few buildings have survived, as some of the campus was sold to the New York Institute of Technology and the structures have found a new use by the college. In May of 2017, the remaining NYIT-affiliated program(s) officially left the Central Islip campus, rendering the majority of the buildings unoccupied.
The Central Islip State Hospital (CISH) Power plant was constructed in 1953 by the Titusville Iron Works Co. and The Interboro Co.
It was constructed to meet the rising electrical demands of the expanding psychiatric facility located in Central Islip Long Island New York.
The Power plant utilized 3 large turbine generators driven by steam created in water tube boilers heated by coal, then eventually oil. Both fuels were delivered by freight train. The steam that spun the generators was then funneled through a system of pipes housed in underground cement corridors to the various buildings on the psychiatric grounds for heating.
The power plant was known as Building number 101 and technically referred to as The Powerhouse. It was the last of 3 power plants constructed on the psychiatric facilities grounds and by far, the largest.
In the mid 1970's, a famous World War II Sherman Tank was discovered buried south of the Power plant.
As de-institutionalization progressed across the United States and commercial power plants on Long Island emerged, The CISH Power plant was eventually relegated to the role of an electrical distribution hub for externally supplied electricity to the few remaining psychiatric buildings still in use.
In 1996, The Central Islip State Hospital was closed down and the property and buildings were sold to New York Tech.
New York Tech sold off the property on which the CISH Powerplant resided, and in 2006, it was demolished to make room for Condominiums.[1][2][3]

Pilcher,"Utica State Hospital, Marcy Division | Marcy State Hospital | Marcy State Psychiatric Hospital | Marcy Correctional Facility","Beginning with the Utica State Hospital in 1843, convicted state prisoners with mental illness and violent pasts have been shuffled between two agencies: correction and mental health. Class-action lawsuits brought on behalf of the inmates in the mid-1970s forced the closure of two correction-run psychiatric facilities and the opening of CNYPC under the state Office of Mental Health in 1977.
The Central New York Psychiatric Center (CNYPC) organization is a comprehensive mental health service delivery system providing a full range of care and treatment to persons incarcerated in the New York State and County Correctional Systems. CNYPC consists of a 220 bed maximum security inpatient facility located in Marcy, NY. CNYPC is the only state facility where male and female patients may be involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to Section 402 of the NYS Corrections Law.
The inpatient facility also includes the Northeast Central Regional Forensic Unit which provides inpatient services for pre-trial detainees from 25 upstate county jails including evaluations for competency to stand trial, NGRI and commitment under Section 508 of the NYS Corrections Law. CNYPC's ""corrections based component"" consists of a statewide network of mental health units located in designated NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) facilities. There are a total of 28 outpatient clinics with 15 full Satellite Units providing a total of 205 crisis beds, 781 Intermediate Care Program beds, and clinic services to approximately 8,500 inmate/patients of the DOCCS 57,000 inmate population.
In addition to its Forensic and Outpatient Programs, CNYPC has a 225 bed, state of the art, Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP). The SOTP's mission is to balance individual treatment needs and community safety. The treatment model promotes positive changes for individuals participating in the program in an effort to reduce the risk of future sexual re-offense. The CNYPC inpatient/outpatient system is fully accredited by The Joint Commission and is the only statewide Correctional/Mental Health system in the United States to have obtained such distinction.

New York,Creedmoor State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Creedmoor_State_Hospital,,1912,1912,Active,Cottage Plan,,Brooklyn State Hospital-Creedmoor Division | Creedmoor Psychiatric Center,"Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, Queens, New York, provides inpatient, outpatient and residential services for severely mentally ill patients. The history of the hospital and its campus, which occupies more than 300 acres (1.2 km²) and includes more than 50 buildings, reflects both the urbanization of the borough of Queens, New York, and a series of changes in psychiatric care.
The hospital’s name derives from the Creeds, a family that previously farmed the site. The local railroad station on a line that ran from Long Island City to Bethpage took the name Creedmoor, apparently from the phrase “Creed’s Moor,” describing the local geography. In the early 1870s, New York State purchased land from the Creeds for use by the National Guard and by the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a firing range. The Creedmoor rifle range hosted prestigious international shooting competitions, which became the forerunner of the Palma Trophy competition. In 1892, as a result of declining public interest and mounting noise complaints from the growing neighborhood, the NRA deeded its land back to the state.
Creedmoor State Hospital opened as the farm colony for Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro), with 32 patients who worked the farmland as part of their treatment, and to ease the expense of their room and board. This was a time when fresh air, physical labor, and rural living were thought to be the best cures for diseases as wide ranging as hysteria and dementia. A self-sustaining community was developed, and to this day many lament the cessation of such programs.
By 1918, Creedmoor’s own census had swollen to 150, housed in the abandoned National Guard barracks. By 1959, the hospital housed 7,000 inpatients. Strange anecdotes regarding Creedmoor and the surrounding areas populated the New York Times’ archives far before deinstitutionalization. The hospital came under scrutiny in the 1940s after a dysentery outbreak due to unsanitary living conditions in the wards. One article tells of a 26-year-old German man with a foot-long beard caught living as a hermit in the woods near Creedmoor in 1931 (police prepared him a steak dinner after arrest). A 1953 article reported two mentally deranged patients overpowering an attendant and escaping Creedmoor, avoiding capture despite a 13-state police alarm. Creedmoor is described as an overcrowded, understaffed, depressing institution in Susan Sheehan's Is There No Place On Earth For Me? (1982), a biography of a patient pseudonymously called Sylvia Frumkin.
By 1974, the hospital was completely out of control, with on-campus crime reaching horrifying numbers: three rapes, 22 assaults, 52 fires, 130 burglaries, six suicides, a shooting, a riot, and an attempted murder occurred within 20 months of each other. And then, in 1984, a patient died after being restrained in a straitjacket and beaten by a staff member with a blackjack.
Staff members reported terrible conditions during this time: being locked in the violent ward, outnumbered by men committed for violent abuse moved to Creedmoor straight from prison, and having to sneak weapons into work for self-defense. A 1977 article tells of one patient who, despite being committed due to stabbing his wife 60 times in the chest and strangling his child with an electric cord, was allowed to freely wander the grounds until the day he casually escaped. Furthermore, this was not an infrequent problem, as Creedmoor maintains an open gate policy despite its solid population of criminals convicted for violent crimes.
The hospital's census had declined by the early sixties, however, as the introduction of new medications, along with other factors, led to the deinstitutionalization of many psychiatric patients around the world. By 2006, parts of the Creedmoor campus had been sold and the inpatient census was down to 470. Today Creedmoor is divided into two sections by Union Turnpike, with the state Office of Mental Health’s psychiatric center in the north. The south campus is home to a number of different programs — some run by various state offices, others by independent nonprofits — many of which provide outpatient services to people with substance-abuse, psychiatric and/or developmental-disability issues.
The hospital’s notable ventures include The Living Museum, which showcases artistic works by patients and is the first museum of its kind in the U.S. In addition, Creedmoor is home to a self-appointed Chassidic Rebbe known as the Admou""r meCreedmoor. The Admou""r is suspected of taking advantage of his diagnosis of multiple personality syndrome in order to defraud Federal and State entitlement programs.
Between the years of 1961 and 1966 LSD-25 was tested on a group of schizophrenic children in the hospital's Children's Unit.

The conditions were such that Governor Morton, in his annual message in 1896, recommended the erection of a building on state land at Dannemora, where convict labor from Clinton Prison would be available. The Legislature, acting upon this recommendation, appropriated $25,000 from the prison capital fund and work was begun. After some delay, due to insufficient appropriations, a comparatively small section of the institution as planned was, in 1900, made ready for the reception of patients. At this time there had been completed at Dannemora a block with two wards for patients, connecting with a central loggia on the first floor and a small infirmary on the second, an employees’ dining room, the main kitchen and the power house. There were no office rooms nor staff quarters and the superintendent and his
assistants were obliged to appropriate for such use the operating room, pharmacy and three or four small guard rooms.
Dannemora State Hospital for Insane Convicts opened in 1900. Dannemora confined and cared for male inmates who were declared insane while serving sentences. Matteawan State Hospital transferred to Dannemora all male inmates who had at least six months left to serve on their sentences. Males serving sentences for felonies in State prisons, reformatories, or penitentiaries, and who were declared insane, were also transferred to Dannemora. In 1912, the name of the institution was changed to the Dannemora State Hospital. In 1972, Dannemora closed and all inmates were transferred to Matteawan.
When Dannemora State Hospital closed, the site became the Adirondack Correctional Treatment and Evaluation Center. This facility offered programs for the rehabilitation of persistent offenders and included a diagnostic team of specialists in psychiatry and psychology. In 1975, the Center closed and the site was converted into the Clinton Annex, a medium security facility for male inmates. Camp Adirondack, a medium security work camp, was also established at the site in 1975. The following year, Camp Adirondack was transferred to Ray Brook and was renamed the Adirondack Correctional Facility.
ACTEC's staffing did not survive budget cutbacks. It closed in 1975, and its grounds and buildings were then annexed to Clinton. Clinton Annex maintained the DSH/ACTEC site's treatment tradition. The Merle Cooper program was introduced in 1977 for inmates who have trouble adjusting to incarceration and to deal with inmates' real or imagined fears of other inmates, and to transition them into the general population. In 2013 the Merle Cooper Program was eliminated and a Special Needs Unit in the main portion of Clinton Correctional was established as an alternative method of programming. Late December the Cuomo administration announced that the Watertown and Gowanda Correctional facilities and the Clinton Annex, part of the Clinton Correctional Facility, will be closed by March 30th.",1975 (as a psychiatric facility),"Dannemora, NY",,
New York,Edgewood State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Edgewood_State_Hospital,,1940,,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Mason General Hospital,"Edgewood State Hospital was a tubercular/psychiatric hospital complex that formerly stood in Deer Park, New York, on Long Island, New York, USA. It was one of four state mental asylums built on Long Island (the others being Kings Park, Central Islip, and Pilgrim), and was the last one of the four to be built.
The hospital was built in the early 1940s, believed to be a Works Progress Administration-funded project. It consisted only of ten buildings (including its massive, prominent 13-story main building), making it the smallest of the four as well (although it was planned to be a larger complex, those plans never made it past paper). The facility was commandeered by the War Department after the United States entered World War II. The War Department completed its construction for use as a psychiatric facility for battle-traumatized soldiers. Its entire campus (in addition to three buildings from nearby Pilgrim State Hospital and numerous temporary structures) was used as ""Mason General Hospital"" by the department.
When the war ended, the hospital was transferred back to New York State, where it essentially operated as the tubercular division of Pilgrim for a few years. In 1946 film director John Huston was assigned by the U.S government to film a documentary film about recovering soldiers in the hospital for propaganda purposes, the film was called ""Let There Be Light"".
Advancements in medicine throughout the 1950s and 1960s that offered alternatives to institutionalization led to decentralization, and the hospital closed in 1971. In the 80’s, there were huge fires that seemed to burn on an annual basis. These fires took their toll on the Hospital, destroying the trademark French style château roof, exposing the metal support pillars. The buildings became home to vagrants, vandals, and partying teenagers, while the land became a dumping ground for old tires, stolen cars, mattresses and other garbage. In May of 1988, City Construction Development Inc. of Jersey City bid $4.9 million to demolish the former Deer Park hospital's four main buildings. On August 16, 1989, to the delight of local citizens and politicians, the tallest building in Long Island, was crumbled to dust. For a few seconds, it looked like the northwest wing of the main building was not going to collapse. However, it finally succumbed to it’s fate, about 5 seconds after the rest of the building. On this day, the main building (102), the nurses dormitory (140), the remnants of the gym, church, movie theater, and kitchen (building 105) were demolished. The final bill for demolition on this day was estimated to be between 11 and $13 million, and it was the largest demolition of state-owned property ever. The final remaining structures were disposed of around 1990–91. Today, the site sits as an open, state-protected oak-brush plains preserve, but one can still find remnants of the former hospital, such as the old rail spur, fire hydrants, etc., scattered about.[1][2]
Let There Be Light was a 1946  American documentary film directed by John Huston.
The film was the final entry in a John Huston trilogy of films produced by the request of the U.S. This documentary film follows 75 U.S. soldiers who have sustained debilitating emotional trauma and depression. A series of scenes chronicle their entry into a psychiatric hospital, their treatment and eventual recovery.
Much of the filming was shot at Edgewood State Hospital.
The film was controversial in its extremely effective portrayal of shell-shocked soldiers from the war. It was subsequently banned after its release despite the fact that the movie was commissioned by the US Army itself, due to the potentially demoralizing effects the film might have on the soldiers.",,"Deer Park, NY",,

The firm was administered by August Carl Esenwein (1856 – 1926) and James Addison Johnson (1865 –1939). They were the architects for Gowanda State Hospital from 1896 to 1912. Gowanda Osteopathic Hospital opened its first building in 1896 upon the 500 acre tract removed from the Taylor Farm by the state of New York. Taylor had previously bequested this acreage to his many nieces and nephews.
Gowanda State Homeopathic Hospital West Group was described in the 1930s as having 1,254 beds, having treated 1,429 patients that
year by 6 house staff, with the result of a history of 4.1% deaths. There are also 10 homeopathic physicians working as consultants from the western New York area. Patients were treated under strict Homeopathic auspices. The medical complex consisted of two-story wings projecting from the main building, two three-story pavilion style buildings, two pavilions for patients with tuberculosis (TB), power house, laundry, kitchen, main dining room building, and smaller dining rooms in several buildings, farm, workshops, nurses home, store room, amusement hall/auditorium, main staff house, and superintendent’s resident -- all built prior to 1946.
GSH also had a Hospital Nursing School, which trained employees for the facility. A graduate program was held every year on the hospital grounds in September. It included an overture, processional, invocation, solo by a singer, address, presentation of new nurses, the
administration of the Nurses’ oath, and a benediction in the program. Nurse uniforms were the traditional nurses’ white cap and a seersucker dress with a white apron. The average class was coed. Many of the orderlies at GSH were Seneca Indians who lived on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation property that abutted the state hospital property. The hospital maintained an archery range, a three-hole full sized golf course, a pond stocked with fish, and a recreational center with movies shown in two showings on Saturdays.
Admissions to the hospital usually occurred during the day. New patients would come in usually by court order. They would be isolated from other patients for thirty days for observation and testing. Mentally ill patients are frequently disoriented by their previous
experiences and thirty days of a more peaceful environment would improve their demeanor or reveal problems they had. Patients were disoriented for various reasons ranging from mental disease, experiences of war, loss of family, homelessness, job loss and other traumatic events
of life. Patients judged to be criminally insane were then sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane or Dannemora State Hospital and not kept at GSH.
GSH had open and closed wards. Some wards were like dorm rooms where patients could not leave. Other wards were two-to-a-room. And other wards in other buildings had patients who could leave during the day and then had to return at night. Curfew times would vary according to the ward. The overall issue was everyone’s safety at all times and that all patients had things to do. Idle patients meant nothing but trouble for the  hospital, the ward, staff, and the group of patients involved. Patients with assigned work duties would go to work.
By the 1970s, because of the Rockefeller Drug Laws, the prison population began exploding in numbers, forcing officials to look wherever they could for housing facilities. Gowanda Psychiatric was one of these facilities. When it was discovered that drugs were much cheaper than hospital asylums,Gowanda closed very slowly over a period of time. In 1979 GSH lost its farm program and more of its general population who worked on the farm. The signs of change that would happen in the care of the mentally ill led to attempts at reducing costs. In 1982 the state took over 40 percent of the hospital grounds and began to convert the area to a medium security prison. The rest of Gowanda Psychiatric Center (then the new name for Gowanda State Hospital) had been scheduled to shut down by the beginning of 1991, but it remained open for a couple of more years. In 1993 the state spent $2.9 million to keep the staff and only 14 patients on the premises as part of their plan to keep the facility available for future use. This plan failed when the issue became a fiscal red herring. The closing of the state hospital stretched over many years and was met by protests first against job losses and later against having a prison in the area, despite the additional new job possibilities.
In 1982 the state converted 40 percent of Gowanda State Hospital into a medium security prison and named it Collins Correctional Institution (two separate prisons I and II). In 1994, the Department of Corrections of the State of New York opened a second prison which is located on the state hospital grounds adjacent to Collins Correctional Institution and named it Gowanda Correctional Institution. Gowanda houses 2,300 male prisoners. The ratio of employees to prisoner is 1 employee for every 2.3 prisoners. Staff correctional officers typically work for a range of 12 to 25 years for the institution and live locally. The prisons are separated by a fence and are administered as separate entities that share only heat, water, and power from the old Gowanda State Hospital power plant.
Collins Correctional Institution was founded in 1982 and is divided into two separate compounds (Collins I and Collins II), each with its own secured perimeter fence. Many of the new employees had been employees of the former Gowanda State Hospital. Each compound has a mess hall, library, reception area, commissary, recreational areas, and visiting rooms. There are multiple occupancy rooms in the compounds as well as single and double cells for prisoners. Collins also has a maximum security S-Block. These are 100 cells of double occupancy for inmates who have a tendency to assault staff or not to respond to orders that are used to segregate them from the general population.
Gowanda Correctional Institution opened in 1994 with the transfer of inmates to the new facility. It was located across the road from Collins Correctional Institution to the north and covered additional buildings and grounds of the former state hospital on 40 acres. 2 towers of six stories, known as A and B buildings, were built in 1957. They were built parallel, are identical in appearance and are connected by a four story crossover that contains offices, classrooms and a large kitchen which delivers meals to the entire facility. Gowanda has 33 cafeterias to receive food. Underground tunnels from the old state hospital are used to deliver food. East of the towers is a one-story brick building in the shape of a cross that was built in 1933. It has classrooms, a commissary, and maintenance areas. West of the towers is a one story building built in 1985, which is used for a gymnasium, a library, and an employee cafeteria. South of the towers are two identical three-story brick buildings, built in 1933. Each has a long wing jutting out of the four corners. The buildings are named C and D and are used to house inmates, special inmates such as sex offenders.
The Cuomo administration announced Dec. 21, 2020, that it would close Gowanda Correctional Facility, along with one in Watertown and the annex at Clinton Correctional, a maximum-security state prison in Dannemora. The state gave the facilities 90 days before closing each of them at the end of March 2021.

New York,Harlem Valley State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Harlem_Valley_State_Hospital,,1919,1924,Closed,Cottage Plan,Wm. Haugaard,Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center,"One day after the incorporation of the Board of Managers, Harlem Valley State Hospital came into being. It opened on April 24th, 1924 ""for the care and treatment of the insane"" as part of an act to discontinue the farm and industrial prison at Wingdale. Buildings A, B and C had already been constructed at the State Road (Route 22) site and money was soon requested to buy adjoining farmland and buildings to build a root cellar, dairy barn, piggery and poultry house for 3000 chickens. With 24 patients admitted on August 11 from New York City and Long Island, the hospital was ready to become part of the history of Harlem Valley.
Between 1925 and 1929, the certified capacity of the new hospital rose from 250 to 1294. During that time, the Board of Managers, which, in later years, became the Board of Visitors, approved changing the course of the State Route 22 so that it would skirt most of the grounds instead of running directly through. By 1928 Buildings F and H were competed and Kitchen G was readied. In addition, tennis courts were built, physical culture classes were started and a baseball team for employees was organized. Then, by 1929 new staff quarters were completed and a switchboard was installed that served for 60 years. In the fall of the year, the School of Nursing, constructed in 1926, opened on September 23 with 14 enrolled.
By 1934 the hospital was considered complete except for the Assembly Hall, which was dedicated by New York State Governor Alfred E. Smith three years later in 1937. The Wingdale campus evolved into a town within itself with a farm, laundry, bakery, refrigeration plants and storerooms. The new baseball field and grandstand with a grassy expanse beyond added to the planned village look. Also in 1934 child guidance clinics were opened in Mt. Kisco and Mt. Vernon. Clinic increased in number until World War II, when they were discontinued due to staffing problems and travel restrictions.
An early high point in Harlem Valley history occurred in 1936 when Dr. Manfred Sakal of Vienna was invited to demonstrate his method of insulin shock treatment at a special institute of State hospital physicians. The course of instruction lasted six weeks after which physicians returned to their various hospitals to set up treatment units. Then, other physicians from intuitions throughout the United States and Canada came to Harlem Valley for several months to receive instruction. For a period of time, insulin shock therapy became standard treatment in State hospitals.
As World War II was drawing near in 1941, electric shock therapy was introduced at the hospital. When the United States entered the war, employees were drawn away to take part in the effort, either as part of the armed forces or to work in war industries. Naturally, Harlem Valley was proud of those who served. Later their names were displayed on a bronze plaque in the Administration Building. And, even with the war going on and staffing short, the census reached a high of 5,415 in 1943. It retreated to 4474 during 1945, though.
In post World War II 1947, the first personnel department for recruiting purposes was established. The nursing school, which operated throughout the war, had no students in 1948 as census again moved upward. In 1950, it reached 5078. During that same year ten lobotomies were performed at the hospital. In 1952, the Carmel Clinic began offering services to all members of the community, regardless of age.
By 1955 a patient intramural softball league had been organized and 100 patients a month attended the Dover Plains Theater free of charge as part of the program for recreation. That year was notable for something of more far reaching significance. It was the first year that psychotropic medications were used at Harlem Valley. These would provide later to dramatically alleviate symptoms and help patients toward recovery and normalization of their lives. The year 1956 saw a record census of 5,818, patients, though.
Towards the end of the decade, in 1958, an open door policy was instituted. Ambulatory patients who had honor cards and who lived on unlocked wards could go out on the grounds during daylight hours. This was a new practice, but something older was abandoned. The end of an era came with the cessation of farm activities at Harlem Valley in March 1960. The hospital was no longer a self-sufficient community in eastern Dutchess County. Three years later the framework of new construction began to loom against the eastern hillside - a sign of further expansion - which had been recommended years earlier. The medical/surgical building - Sullivan Tower or, more commonly, Building 85 - was being erected. It was completed in the fall of 1966 and contained wards for infirm patients, an operating room, laboratory, diagnostic equipment, clinics, medical library and mortuary. The building was technologically state-if-the-art. Modernization in other campus locations also took place. In 1969 renovation of open porches into enclosed sun porches was completed.
Layoffs occurred in 1971 along with the closing of Building A, B, and C. The following year, the Wingdale unit of Westchester Developmental Center reopened these buildings for their own use, with administrative responsibility resting with Harlem Valley. In 1972, a training team helped a group of hand-picked staff to create what became known as the Metro Unit. This unit featured the interdisciplinary treatment team and introduced other innovations. Patients became ""residents"" and were treated with group therapy. Another significant change took place a year later. On April 4, 1973, unitization of the entire hospital began. This process rearranged patients into wards for those from the same geographical location of Westchester and Putnam counties. This has not been done before. An entirely new mix of patients on wards resulted.
When Harlem Valley celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1974, patient census at the end of April was 1897, reflecting the ongoing efforts towards deinstitutionalization, - or the discharging of patients into the community and linking them up with community services. In this year also, the hospital's official name became Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center.
On the occasion of its 69th anniversary in 1984, acknowledgement was given to Harlem Valley as a leader with the State mental health system. Dr. Steven E. Katz, OMH Commissioner at the time, remarked in a congratulatory letter, ""The last six decades have seen profound change in the role of Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center. Once a rural asylum for the mentally ill, it is now a leader in the provision of community based services aimed at preventing unnecessary hospitalization of the mentally ill."" Governor Mario Cuomo expressed similar thoughts in his letter to HVPC and added, ""Its staff have much for which to be proud.""
The mid-1980's saw Harlem Valley surviving if not necessarily thriving. Assisting the New York City metropolitan region by accepting patients during a critical time was part of its mandate. During this time, refurbishing of the ward environment in more comfortable, personalized terms became art of facility goals. The first wards showcasing this new ""Therapeutic Environment"" resulting in a demonstrable uplift in morale for both residents and staff alike. New lighting, more comfortable furnishings, and accessories, and the modification of spaces, which lowered sound levels, all contributed. Also in this time of renewal family members of patients and significant others interested in the well-being of patients wanted to become more involved with patient care and treatment. They did so by linking in discussion periodically with Harlem Valley administrators and staff to effect changes. Patient advocacy and an inpatient Patient Council came into being. Parallel to this, the movement of consumers of mental health services was also beginning to gain prominence and to be more widely listened to. As testimony to its evolvement, Harlem Valley added the Consumer Advocate Award to its then recently established Distinguished Scholar Award presented annually.
Even before the beginning of the economic slowdown in the time bridging the decades of the eighties and nineties and the resultant crunch affecting the State budget, psychiatric centers were being regarded more and more as costly remainders and reminders from times past. Mental health services in the community were to assume greater importance, greater responsiveness, and greater responsibility, the Office of Mental Health reaffirmed. The introduction of Psychiatric Rehabilitation was to assist in a patient's making choices which could lead, it was hoped, to a more independent, satisfying and productive life eventually in a community environment of his/her choice.
Harlem Valley wasn't the first psychiatric center slated for closure. And the contemplated closing was purportedly not based on any lack of excellence in services delivered. The reason was budgetary. And there were two psychiatric centers in Dutchess County, which the State said it could ill afford. Harlem Valley was in a rural area at a distance from urban areas as compared to the Hudson River Psychiatric Center which was near desired social services and amenities of urban life.
In 1991, Harlem Valley landed on the front pages of local newspapers when Senator Nicholas Spano, chairman of the State mental health committee of the NYS Legislature, held public hearings in Smith Hall on the proposed HVPC closing. Loss of jobs and possible devastation of the local economy, which the town's elected officials and business people envisioned, were decried. Other support for HVPC came from many areas.
Another outcry was head when the deadline for the closing and consolidation with Hudson River Psychiatric Center was changed from April 1, 1994 to December 31, 1993. Negotiations ensued and the resulting final date of closure was changed to ""close of business"" January 31, 1994. Not fully 70 years would have passed from that first admission to the last light out and lowering of the flag.[1]
At recent viewing, the plan appears to be to partially demolish and partially rehabilitate the structure.  Signs on site indicate a kick-off celebration for October 2012.  Indications are for eventual use as a retirement community per local reports.
Renovation of the facility began in September of 2013 after the sale of the facility to Olivet Management, LLC. The company purchased the property on behalf of Olivet University from Benjamin Companies, ""the firm that had intended to build a combined residential/retail community on the property known as Dover Knolls."" Dover Supervisor Ryan Courtien said ""“The University expects to utilize almost all of the existing buildings and infrastructure to build a premier research institution and information technology hub once all approvals have been received,” the supervisor said. “The plan is to have classrooms, residential halls and dining halls.”[2]

New York,Hudson River State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hudson_River_State_Hospital,1866,1868,1871,Closed,Kirkbride Plan,Frederick Clarke Withers (Grounds: Frederick Law Olmstead & Calvert Vaux),Hudson River Psychiatric Center | Hudson Heritage Park | Hudson River Asylum for the Insane,"In 1866, eleven years after the strong memorial presented to the Legislature by county superintendents of the poor setting forth the neglected condition of the insane and recommending the establishment of two additional state hospitals for their care and treatment, Governor Fenton appointed five commissioners to secure a suitable site ""on or near the Hudson River below the City of Albany, upon which to erect the Hudson River Asylum for the Insane."" The offer of a 208-acre farm jointly by the County of Dutchess and the City of Poughkeepsie was accepted and during the following year the Legislature appropriated $100,000 for the construction of one building. Meanwhile there had been appointed a Board of Managers of nine members, who had selected as superintendent Dr. Joseph M. Cleaveland, who had received his training in the parent institution at Utica. With the appropriation above referred to the managers procured an additional 84 acres of land and authorized a New York firm of architects, Messrs. Vaux, Withers & Co., to prepare plans and specifications for a hospital to accommodate 250 patients of each sex. At the same time extensive plans were adopted for the improvement of the grounds. No patients were received until 1871 and only seven patients were accommodated during that year.
In 1872 the total cost of the buildings thus far reached $1,000,000 with current accommodations for only 212 patients. The State Comptroller criticized the managers for spending such an excessive amount of money and having little to show for it. In the managers reply it was pointed out that after the close of the Civil War, and especially by the enactment of the new eight-hour law, the greatly increased cost of both labor and material was responsible for the high costs. They asserted that the plan followed by them of constructing the hospital by day's work rather than by contract was the best to follow; further, that ""although the hospital has cost money, it is worth the money"" and that the Governor, Comptroller and other state officials had inspected the buildings and had approved the plans and specifications and general scheme of construction. However, appropriations for additional work of any magnitude were deferred until 1875, when the Governor, with legislative sanction, appointed a building superintendent to control the further construction of the hospital buildings. It was also ordered that all building operations be done under contract. Although $1,500,000 were expended in the 18 years intervening between 1868 and 1886, accommodations for only 400 patients had been provided.
In March, 1893, Dr. Cleaveland resigned and was succeeded by Dr. Charles W. Pilgrim, who had previously served as superintendent of the Willard State Hospital. With appropriations granted in 1891 a group of cottages had been completed on a distant portion of the hospital grounds for the accommodation of 320 of the insane remaining in the poorhouses of the state. Dr. Pilgrim also found it possible by readjustment of sitting rooms and dormitories to provide accommodations in the main institution for 302 additional patients. Thus the capacity of the institution was increased from 800 beds in 1890 to 1400 in 1893. The central group of buildings, nearly a mile from the main establishment, was enlarged and greatly improved. In 1898 the huge north wing was added, thus increasing the capacity further to 1970. The reception building, designed and equipped specially for the care and treatment of new and supposedly curable cases, was occupied in 1908, as was also the building known as Inwood, designed specially for the care of the chronic insane. The capacity was further increased by these buildings to 2708. The land now comprised in the grounds and buildings has reached 1000 acres.
The title of this institution adopted at the time of its organization is the Hudson River State Hospital.
The different groups of buildings permit an excellent classification, the tubercular and epileptic, the most troublesome and dangerous of all, being removed from the general wards. The hospital is thoroughly equipped and has every facility for doing the most advanced psychiatric work. The staff consists of 20 physicians, and there are 608 employees engaged in the work of the hospital. Superintendent Pilgrim served as State Commissioner in Lunacy for one year, 1906, on leave of absence from the hospital.
The main hospital buildings are located on a beautiful slope which extends to the banks of the Hudson River and affords a variety of beautiful vistas.
A trained pathologist, who devotes his entire time to studies of the brain and nervous system, is one of the valuable adjuncts of the hospital. Another feature of merit is a thoroughly organized training school for nurses, which is conducted with enthusiasm and success by the medical staff. A no less important feature is the course of training for beginners, t. e., ward attendants, all of whom are given a course of five lectures, one by the first assistant physician, on the general subject of insanity, the necessity of forbearance, especially on the part of attendants detailed to escort patients to the hospital, and general features of the insanity law; the remaining five on practical ward work, bathing, dining room and kindred work.
Staff meetings are held four times each week, at which unusual cases are submitted for study and diagnosis. During 1913 the accommodations in the Edgewood Building for 40 patients of the most disturbed class were finished and made ready for occupancy. Two considerable extensions of the reception building were finished, increasing the capacity of the building by 16. These additions were supplemented by spacious verandas. A large sewing room for the disturbed and semi-demented *omen patients was completed and an average of 70 patients are now employed therein.[1]
Frederick Clarke Withers designed the Kirkbride style Main Building in 1867. It was intended to be completed quickly, but went far over its original schedule and budget and remained under construction for almost a quarter century after it first opened. A nine-member Board of Managers was created and appointed to initiate and oversee construction of the actual building. Withers planned a building 1,500 feet (457 m) in length and over 500,000 square feet (45,000 m²) in area, most of its two wings that would house patients. It was the first institutional building in the U.S. designed in the High Victorian Gothic style. Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmstead, designers of New York's Central Park, laid out the surrounding landscape. Like Withers, they had been mentored by the influential Andrew Jackson Downing in nearby Newburgh.
The centerpiece of his design was the administration building. The two wings, designed to hold 300 patients of either sex, were divided by a chapel placed between them in the yard behind the administration building so that patients could not see into the rooms of the opposite sex. The building and landscape plan were meant to aid in patients' recovery, by giving them adequate space and privacy and imbuing their healing with a sense of grandeur.
Construction began in 1868, with the cost estimated at $800,000. Cost-saving measures included the construction of a new dock on the Hudson so that building materials could be shipped more directly to the site, quarrying and cutting the foundation stones on site, mixing concrete from local materials and hiring local craftsmen instead of a general contractor. The board also deviated from the plan it had sent the state, in particular by building a shorter female wing when it came to believe that fewer patients of that sex would be admitted. As a result it is one of the few Kirkbride hospitals to have been built with asymmetrical wings.
Despite efforts to save money, the board was slightly over the $100,000 it had expected to spend that year, according to its first annual report. The main building was completed and opened, with 40 patients admitted, in October 1871. As work continued on other structures planned for the complex, so did the cost overruns. In 1873, the year county residents had been promised the hospital would be finished, the New York Times ran an editorial harshly criticizing the board for not only having gone way over budget but for lavish extravagance and waste:
The managers have entirely disregarded the law by which they were authorized to act. They have altered the plans and specifications ... Some of the details of the extravagance of the board are amazing. For instance, the first part of the work undertaken was the construction of a reservoir, into which the water was pumped from the river through an eight-inch (20 cm) iron pipe; from the reservoir the water was carried to the hospital by a twelve-inch (30 cm) iron pipe, the engine and machinery employed being on the scale of those used in supplying a neighboring city of 20,000 inhabitants. The cost of the reservoir was $100,000. Thirty thousand dollars was expended in blasting some rough rocks jutting into the reservoir, and the Superintendent gave as a reason for this that, if some of the patients were missing, they might want to rake the bottom of the reservoir to find the bodies, and with this the rocks would interfere ... The floors are laid in yellow Southern pine, the most expensive of the flooring, fitted and cut in a way greatly to enhance the cost. The heating is arranged on a scale that, with only 150 patients, ten tons (9 tonnes) of coal per day is consumed. The mention of these items sufficiently explains the disappearance of $1,200,000 of the people's money.
Some efforts were made to stop the project, but the legislature continued to appropriate funds despite further revelations like these. Construction continued until 1895, when further money could not be found. Despite this expenditure of time and money, the hospital's original plan was still not complete, and never would be.
Many new buildings continued to be constructed throughout the first part of the 20th century. As late as 1952 the institution was treating as many as 6,000 patients. Changes in the treatment of mental illness, such as psychotherapy and psychotropic drugs, were making large-scale facilities relics and allowing more patients to lead more normal lives without being committed. By the late 1970s the hospital administration decided to shut down the two main wings of the Kirkbride building, as few patients were residing in them and due to neglect some of the floors had collapsed. The state offices of Mental Health and Historic Preservation clashed over a plan to demolish the wings, even after the National Historic Landmark designation in 1989. In the 1990s, more and more of the hospital site would be abandoned as its services were needed less and less. The hospital consolidated with Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center in 1994 and closed the main campus (including the Kirkbride building) in 2001. The remaining hospital operations moved into a much smaller building nearby.
The state had decided to sell the main hospital campus for redevelopment, and in 2005 the Empire State Development Corporation sold 156 acres (62 ha) including the Kirkbride Main Building to Hudson Heritage LLC, a subsidiary of the Chazen Companies, for $2.75 million. Hudson Heritage and Chazen plan to thoroughly renovate the Kirkbride into a combination hotel/apartment complex as the centerpiece of a residential/commercial campus, Hudson Heritage Park. Redevelopment plans hit two setbacks later in the 2000s. In 2005, the Town of Poughkeepsie imposed a moratorium on new construction while it adjusted its zoning to deal with its growth. Hudson Heritage has been seeking to have a ""historic revitalization district"" created for the property that would help spur its growth. Then, on May 31, 2007, lightning struck the south wing of the Kirkbride, causing one of the most serious fires in Dutchess County's history. It is unclear whether that portion of the building can be effectively restored after such severe damage.[2] Starting in mid-2019, work has resumed on the Hudson Heritage project, with the treeline hiding the campus from NY Rt. 9 being removed, before demolition work on the campus buildings began in late 2019. After delays due to COVID-19 shutdowns, work has resumed [3].
In May 2011, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a restructuring of mental health facilities after the Legislature adopted a budget that he said would close an overall state budget deficit of $10 billion. The closure of the Hudson River hospital would affect 375 workers and about 125 patients. A spokeswoman for the state Office of Mental Health, Leesa Rademacher, said most of the patients were moved over time after the announcement in 2011, the last 15 were relocated the week of the hospital's closing. Patients were moved to other New York facilities, primarily Rockland Psychiatric Center in Orangeburg. Many of the hospital employees took jobs in other facilities or state agencies where their civil service seniority gave them “bumping” rights to displace less-senior workers in similar titles. Others lost their jobs. The hospital was officially closed on January 25, 2011. [4]

It is classified as a maximum security correctional facility, to be used as a general confinement facility for males 16 years of age or older. Many of the inmates are from the New York City area and have sentences of less than one year. Eastern presently confines approximately 1,100 inmates.
The Laws of 1892, Chapter 336, established the Eastern New York Reformatory. The institution opened on October 1, 1900. Administered by the Superintendent of State Prisons, Eastern received prisoners from any State prison or reformatory. Most of its inmates were transferred from the New York State Reformatory at Elmira. In 1906, the State Board of Managers of Reformatories was established and given authority over both the Elmira and Eastern reformatories. They appointed a superintendent for each institution.
The Laws of 1921, Chapter 483, changed Eastern from a reformatory into the Institution for Male Defective Delinquents at Napanoch. The control of Napanoch was taken from the Board of Managers of State reformatories and placed under the State Commission for Mental Defectives. The institution was similar to Bedford's division for defective delinquent women. The new institution had the function of caring for, training, and treating defective delinquent inmates over the age of 16. Sent to Napanoch were individuals charged with committing a crime who were judged to be mentally defective by a board of examiners. Usually admitted were individuals who were judged to have IQs under 70. In addition, inmates at other institutions could be examined and subsequently transferred to Napanoch. All sentences at Napanoch were indefinite. The Napanoch program focused principally on discipline and military drill. There was a large farming program as well.
In 1927, the institution was placed under the Department of Mental Hygiene and the following year put under the Department of Correction. In 1958 (Chapter 370), Napanoch was renamed the Eastern Correctional Institution. Part of the institution was for regular inmates while another part continued for inmates of below-normal or borderline intelligence. In 1966 (Chapter 819), the institution was renamed the Catskill Reformatory. Inmates considered defective delinquent were sent to the Institution for Mental Defective Delinquents at Beacon. In 1970, the institution was given its present name.",1966 (as a psychiatric facility),"Napanoch, NY",,
New York,Kings Park State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kings_Park_State_Hospital,1885,,"June 18, 1888",Closed,Metropolitan Cottage Plan,,Kings Park Psychiatric Center | Kings County Asylum,"Although successive superintendents pleaded with the county authorities for additional buildings, no provision for relief was made.
Finally, when conditions became intolerable, after patients had been crowded into the basements of the large asylum building and into an old frame building quite unfit for the purpose, public sentiment compelled action by the county authorities, and in 1885 about 850 acres of land were purchased at St. Johnland, 43 miles to the east, on Long Island, and a branch asylum was established.
Temporary frame buildings were erected on the new site for the immediate reception of patients, and in the fall of 1885 55 patients, 32 men and 23 women, were transferred to the St. Johnland Farm.
The new institution was established on the cottage plan. Sixteen frame buildings were to be erected to accommodate about 450 patients, and a laundry, heating plant, barns, etc., were also to be built. But progress in the erection of these buildings was very slow. In the spring of 1887 150 additional patients were received, making a total of 200, all being crowded into the three original temporary buildings.
In 1887 Dr. D. A. Harrison, assistant physician in charge of the St. Johnland Branch Asylum, was made medical superintendent, the general superintendent in charge of all the charitable institutions of the county, including the two asylums for the insane, then being Dr. John A. Arnold.
The first two permanent cottages were opened on June 18, 1888, and 14 more in 1889. Although these were promptly filled with patients far beyond their estimated capacity, the overcrowding in the Flatbush Asylum, instead of being relieved by these transfers, was actually worse than ever, so that it became necessary for the county to provide for the erection of more buildings.
A change at this time in the personnel of the Commissioners of Charities and Corrections of Kings County, who controlled building operations, brought about a very serious condition. Medical officers were soon warned against a too plain presentation of the existing situation or of the most obvious necessities required for the patients under their care, and failure to observe this warning resulted in demotion or dismissal. Thus in 1889 Dr. Harrison's salary was reduced by $600, the difference being added to the salary of the recently appointed counsel of the commissioners. Dr. Harrison protested and then resigned, being succeeded by Dr. John L. Macumber.
At Flatbush Dr. Arnold, the general medical superintendent, resigned in 1892, being followed by Dr. Walter S. Fleming, who in turn was succeeded in 1893 by Dr. William E. Sylvester.
During the four succeeding years a large amount of construction was carried on at Kings Park. Four large brick buildings to accommodate 600 patients were built (buildings A, B, C and D); two large water reservoirs were constructed, also barns, an engine and dynamo room, a steam plant, conduits, sewers, etc. A subsequent investigation showed an extraordinary waste of public funds in this construction. Eighty thousand dollars is said to have been paid for a cow barn for which a fair price would have been $10,000 or $12,000. Eleven million bricks were used to fill an excavation prepared for the erection of buildings (C and D) and charged as an extra. Hundreds of barrels of cement were ordered to reduce the grades of a road near the canal, though it was said that the barge carrying this material sprung a leak and after the cement became wet it was simply piled on the bank. The cement in round barrel form can be seen there to this day. Hundreds of wagon loads of dirt were removed from the excavation for the water reservoirs and carted to a distance of nearly a mile into the woods, and then brought back again to build an embankment around the upper reservoir.
Meantime Dr. Macumber, who had protested against some of the more flagrant developments, was forced to resign on January 1, 1893, the vacancy being filled by the promotion of Dr. Oliver M. Dewing.
Conditions became so scandalous that an investigation was undertaken by a committee of the Assembly into the affairs of the Department of Charities and Correction, and Hugo Hirsch, of Brooklyn, was made special counsel.
The committee quickly found gross violation of law on the part of the commissioners. Officers and subordinates of acknowledged capacity and honesty had been superseded by men of no experience in the work to be performed, or, if not deficient in capacity, of doubtful integrity. Additional and useless employees were appointed with duties assigned to them that had previously been properly performed by other employees of the board. To quote from the report:
The conspirators proceeded to violation of the law and acts of fraud. We found that the department was being used not only for the purpose of making places for the hangers-on of the corrupt politicians who controlled the department, but that these hangers-on did no work and received pay purely as sinecurists. We found men who were chronically sick, and thousands upon thousands of dollars were paid to men who were marked absent on the time books and who received their pay for the full month.
In spite of the millions of dollars which the county thus spent upon the insane, the standard of care under the county regime was very low. The buildings were unsuitable and unhygienic, facilities inadequate, clothing insufficient and of poor quality, food often unfit for human consumption, the physicians were underpaid and their recommendations unheeded. Thus, Dr. Carlos F. MacDonald, State Commissioner in Lunacy, who had served as medical superintendent at Flatbush, testified before the Assembly investigating committee as follows:
I may say generally that the standard of care and treatment of the insane in Kings County was, and had been for years previous, very much below that of any other locality in the state.
It is gratifying to be able to record that in the midst of this atmosphere of shameless corruption the medical officers connected with the work of caring for the insane, without a single exception, had thrown expediency to the winds and at the risk of having their entire careers blighted, boldly opposed dishonesty and inefficient methods until they were, one after another, removed from their posts. But the flagrant dishonesty of the county officials brought about as a direct result the legislation by which, in 1895, in the face of the most determined opposition, the asylums at Flatbush and Kings Park were transferred to the care of the state.
At the time of this transfer the medical superintendent at Kings Park was Dr. Oliver M. Dewing, serving under General Superintendent Dr. William E. Sylvester.
Upon assuming financial supervision of the hospital the State Commission in Lunacy authorized the erection of a large group of buildings at Kings Park to accommodate 1000 patients, with a view to the early discontinuance of the establishment at Flatbush. These buildings, now known as Group 1, were opened in January, 1889. By the time the buildings were completed new problems confronted the commission. The crowding of the buildings of the Manhattan State Hospital had become such that the commission was compelled to retain Flatbush Asylum, and to use the new group of buildings for the relief of overcrowding on Ward's Island and in part to care for the patients of the buildings abandoned on Hart's Island and Blackwell's Island. Accordingly, 500 patients were received by transfer at Kings Park.
Thus the hospital at Kings Park soon became more important tban the institution at Flatbush, of which it originally was a branch. The headquarters of the general medical superintendent were soon transferred to Kings Park, and finally, on May 1, 1900, it became by law a separate state hospital, independent of the institution at Flatbush, and the position of general medical superintendent was abolished.
On June 1, 1904, the State Commission in Lunacy transferred Dr. William Austin Macy, then superintendent of the Willard State Hospital, to the Kings Park State Hospital, Dr. Dewing going to the Long Island State Hospital at Flatbush.
It is generally to the credit of the medical men who struggled under the adverse conditions above described that sustained systematic individual and collective studies were made as to the causes of insanity and its various forms, in order to keep the hospital abreast with others of the state. Determined efforts were made 'o abolish all mechanical restraint, and, as heretofore indicated, a constant struggle was made for proper food, sanitation, proper clothing, heating, lighting and ventilation, but obviously a systematic organization of the medical work could not be perfected.
As soon as the hospital entered the state system, however, a reorganization of the medical service and a readjustment of salaries were at once made. Blank forms were introduced for use in making physical and mental examinations, and reports made showing the progress of each case and a convenient and uniform loosesheet system of files for medical records adopted. Finally, it became apparent that the personnel of the state hospital medical staffs was made up either of young men without special psychiatrical training or of older men who had merely gone through the general movement throughout the state by which the construction, organization and administrative adjustment of the institution for the insane was accomplished. To remedy this condition a State Pathological Institute was established.
The contrast between conditions under county care and those under state care is well brought out by the history of this institution, and constitutes perhaps a lesson never to be forgotten.
The hospital continued to be known as the Long Island State Hospital at Kings Park until 1905, when the name was changed by legislative enactment to Kings Park State Hospital.
An employees' home, with a capacity for 300, was completed and opened in the early part of 1906. A new laundry was completed in 1910, the old one having been destroyed by fire. A new boiler house was completed in 1910.
The Legislature has provided funds to extend this hospital materially. During 1912 a large group of brick buildings with accommodations for 700 patients was finished and three large frame pavilions for 250 patients of the tubercular class were occupied in 1913, bringing the capacity of the institution up to 4000 beds.
The Kings Park State Hospital is much better off in equipment and facilities for doing its medical work than it was in the years gone by. Its laboratory, while not perfectly equipped, has everything necessary for average work of any kind.
By the time of this report (1916) the value of the real estate and personal property of this hospital is, in round numbers, $4,500,000. The cottage system upon which it was originally planned has not been maintained, being superseded in late years by congregate groups of buildings. Even the frame pavilions for the tubercular class just completed are connected and thus made easy of administration. The large group of brick buildings for the chronic class, completed in 1912, has been found in practice the most economical as well as the most suitable for this type of patients.
The growth of the hospital from its beginning in 1885 as a branch of the county asylum, with temporary accommodations for 65 patients in crudely constructed structures, to its attainment in 1914 of an equipment of 76 buildings and a population of 4266 patients, with all that these figures imply, has been but a reflection of the expansion and progress of the district from which it draws its patients, the counties of Kings, Nassau and Suffolk, and its future development will be likewise as rapid and progressive as nay be anticipated for such district. The continued increase of the demands that will be made upon it for service should take no one by surprise.[1]
As patient populations grew throughout the early part of the 20th century, the hospital itself continued to grow, and by the late 1930s the state began to build upward instead of outward. During this time period, the famous 13-story Building 93 was built. Designed by state architect William E. Haugaard and funded with Works Progress Administration money, the building, often dubbed ""the most famous asylum building on Long Island,"" was completed in 1939 and would be used as an infirmary for the facility's geriatric patients, as well as for patients with chronic physical ailments.
Post-World? War II, Kings Park and the other Long Island asylums would see their patient populations soar. In 1954, the patient census at Kings Park topped 9,300, but would begin a steady decline afterwards. By the time Kings Park reached its peak patient population, the old ""rest and relaxation"" philosophy surrounding farming gave way to pre-frontal lobotomies and electro-shock therapy, but those methods would quickly become ancient in 1955, following the introduction of Thorazine, the first widely used drug in the treatment of mental illness. As medication made it possible for patients to live normal lives outside of a mental institution, the need for large facilities like Kings Park diminished, and the patient population began to drop. By the early 1990s the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, as it had come to be known by that point, was operating as a ghost of its former self, with many buildings being shut down or reduced in usage (including the massive Building 93, by the early 1990s, only the first few floors of the building were in use).
In the early 1990s, with patient populations at increasingly low levels, the New York State Office of Mental Health (formerly the Department of Mental Hygiene) began to plan for the closure of Kings Park as well as another Long Island asylum, the Central Islip Psychiatric Center. The plans called for Kings Park and Central Islip to close, and have any remaining patients from both facilities transferred to Pilgrim Psychiatric Center, which was at one time the world's largest hospital, or be discharged. In the fall of 1996, the plans were implemented, and the few remaining patients from Kings Park and Central Islip were transferred to Pilgrim, ending Kings Park's 111-year run.
Today, the sprawling area that once housed the Kings Park Psychiatric Center stands as a testament to a forgotten era. In the spring of 2000, the waterfront portion of the former campus was reopened as the Nissequogue River State Park, preventing it from development, while the rest lies mostly abandoned (the rail spur, abandoned in the late 1980s, was converted into part of a hike-bike trail in 2003). Pilgrim Psychiatric Center, which took in the remaining patients from Kings Park, runs three group homes on the non-parkland portion of the campus while everything else is abandoned. Since 1996, several proposals regarding the property have come and gone, and today, a developer is looking into purchasing the non-parkland portions of the grounds from New York State. This development proposal has proven to be highly controversial. The former campus contains numerous obstacles to development, the biggest obstacles are several buildings that were demolished into their basements and buried while the hospital was still open. All of these buildings, which contained asbestos, were never properly abated. Other obstacles include buried ash from the hospital's power generation facilities, asbestos-lined steam tunnels, and asbestos-laden buildings. These obstacles have created a fear in the surrounding community that the developer will have no choice but to build high-density housing to cover the environmental clean-up costs in order to make a profit. In January 2006, New York State aborted the sale of the property, and the future of the site continues to remain uncertain at the present time, with a suit filed by the developer pending in the courts. With the sale canceled, security has been stepped up at the facility once again as the property has been an attraction for trespassers. Also, pets have now been banned from the park year round.
It was also announced that NY State officials had agreed on a new plan for the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center property that they were calling the most significant step in years toward getting the long-stalled redevelopment process under way.
Outgoing parks commissioner Bernadette Castro has persuaded other state officials to transfer most of the hospital property to her agency. The plan calls for 368 acres (1.49 km2) to be added to Nissequogue River State Park, which was created in 1999 from 153 acres (0.62 km2) of adjacent hospital property. Then the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation will request proposals for a private-public partnership for redeveloping part of the site where vacant buildings stand.
The 1995 movie Eyes Beyond Seeing, by director Daniel Robert Cohn, was filmed in KPPC's Building 136/137 (old medical/surgical unit) shortly after the building was closed down. The film also contains exterior shots of the famous Building 93 (The 13 story tall Geriatric/Ambulatory building), in an attempt to convince viewers that the interior shots were done inside 93. The film stars Keith Hamilton Cobb as a mental patient claiming to be Jesus Christ, and also features a cameo by Henny Youngman, in his final movie appearance before his death, as a mental patient claiming to be Henny Youngman. Henny Youngman actually performed for the patients of KPPC back when it was still open, so it was a nice homage from him to the patients to portray one himself.[2]

New York,Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kirby_Forensic_Psychiatric_Center,,,1985,Active,Metropolitan Plan,,Manhattan State Hospital  | Manhattan Psychiatric Center,"Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, is a maximum security hospital of the New York State Office of Mental Health. It is located on the campus of the Manhattan Psychiatric Center on Ward's Island but separated from the facility in 1985 and is now considered a semi-independent entity. It provides secure treatment and evaluation for the forensic patients and courts of New York City and Long Island. Most patients are received through the courts under Criminal Procedure Law (CPL) or through the OMH Commissioner's office via the New York State Code of Rules and Regulations (NYSCRR) regarding hospitalization of the mentally ill.
Treatment is provided in accordance with the current standards of professional care outlined by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Health Organizations (JCAHO) and is carried out with respect for each patient's privacy and rights, in agreement with his/her level of functioning and need for security. KFPC has an active staff education program as well as academic affiliations with several metropolitan area colleges and universities, to help assure quality treatment and state of the art care.

New York,Brooklyn State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Long_Island_State_Hospital,,1852,1856,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Original),,Flatbush Insane Asylum | Kings County Asylum | Kings County Lunatic Asylum | Long Island State Hospital | Kingsboro State Hospital | Kingsboro Psychiatric Center,"The main building of Kings County Lunatic Asylum, located in Flatbush, was funded by Chapter 278 of the Laws of 1852, which authorized Kings County to negotiate a loan for the extension of hospital accommodations for care of the insane in connection with its almshouse. A further authorization, made by Chapter 255 of the Laws of 1853, provided for a loan to complete the institution under construction. This amount proved insufficient and an additional loan was authorized by Chapter 927 of the Laws of 1855.
The building as originally planned was to consist of an administration building and four wings, but when it opened only two wings had been erected. The institution received its first patients in April 1854; by the end of the first month of operation it was caring for 178 patients. The demand for more room for patients necessitated an enlargement, and four additional wings were built, two on either side of the original main building. The first two were occupied by patients on June 1, 1861, and the latter two on July 1, 1869. To make room for more patients, a building originally erected on the almshouse grounds as a nursery was remodeled for asylum use; 267 patients were subsequently transferred there. Known as the ""Hospital for Incurables,"" it functioned as a separate institution until May 1884, when it became part of the main asylum.
In February 1882, a fire occurred in the main building and destroyed the rear portion of the easterly end of the men's wards. After repair the building was used without extensive modifications until 1911, when the electric wiring and plumbing were renewed and fireproof stairways and steel ceilings were installed.
In 1885, a farm was purchased at St. Johnland (on the northern side of Long Island about 40 miles from the city of Brooklyn) as a site for a branch institution to relieve the overcrowding at Flatbush. This branch later developed into the Kings Park State Hospital. Transfer of patients to the branch began in the fall of 1885. The two institutions were under one management until 1900.
Kings County Lunatic Asylum became the Long Island State Hospital and was transferred to the state by the county on July 1, 1895. In 1900, the St. Johnland branch was given separate management and became Long Island State Hospital at Kings Park; the main part of the institution became Long Island State Hospital at Flatbush (Laws of 1900, Chapter 634). In 1916, Long Island State Hospital at Kings Park was renamed Kings Park State Hospital; Long Island State Hospital at Flatbush was renamed Brooklyn State Hospital.
In May 1916, ground was broken on the Brooklyn site for a reception hospital for 150 patients, and for a building for continued treatment cases to accommodate 400 people. These buildings were completed and open to use in 1919. That same year a contract was let for the construction of another building for continued treatment cases with a capacity of 400 people. The building was completed and occupied in 1921. In 1974, Brooklyn State Hospital was renamed Brooklyn Psychiatric Center. In 1975, it was renamed again to Kingsboro Psychiatric Center.
Brooklyn State Hospital is under the jurisdiction of the State Department of Mental Hygiene. It takes nervous and mental cases from Kings County. The institution has 2,725 beds with complete facilities for observation care, and treatment. The Brooklyn State Hospital was opened in 1895, taking over some of the functions handled by the Kings County Hospital. During the past twenty years all the old buildings have been replaced by fireproof modern structures. The hospital grounds cover twenty-eight acres, and around the nineteen-story central building, opened in 1935, are grouped a number of ward and service buildings. Additions now being constructed will increase the bed capacity to 3,250.

New York,Matteawan State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Matteawan_State_Hospital,,1886,1892,Preserved,Corridor Plan,,"Asylum for Insane Criminals, | Fishkill Correctional Facility (Current)","In 1886, a legislative commission recommended the purchase of the 246-acre Dates Farm in the village of Matteawan for $25,000, or just over $100 per acre. The site was accessible by rail and offered good tillable land, pure water and pleasant scenery between the Hudson River and the Fishkill Mountains An architect was hired to draw plans for buildings with ""an abundance of light and ventilation"" to accommodate 550 patients. In April 1892, the Asylum for Insane Criminals, with 261 patients, was relocated from Auburn to its new site. The following year, it was renamed Matteawan State Hospital.
550 beds were not enough. Seven years later, in 1899, another prison mental hospital was built on the grounds of Clinton. Dannemora would hold male convicts becoming insane while serving their sentences, and had the power to retain them if they remained insane at expiration of their sentences. Matteawan would hold unconvicted males as well as females in both categories.
Except for tighter security, Matteawan functioned the same as the state's civil hospitals. Until the 1950's and thorazine, doctors prescribed the program of ""moral treatment"" developed in the early 1800's. It consisted of kind and gentle treatment in a stress-free, highly routine environment. Patients who were capable were assigned to a work program (often called ""occupational therapy""): cooking, maintenance, farming and making baskets, rugs, clothing and bedsheets.
Patients were given outdoor exercise in the courtyards twice daily and motion pictures were shown weekly. Radios and phonographs were available on the wards. Patients played softball, tennis, bowling, tennis, handball, shuffleboard, volleyball, chess, checkers, cards, gymnastics, ping pong and quoits (similar to horseshoes but with iron rings). At Christmas and other special occasions, there were teas for the women, smokes for the men and ""vaudeville entertainments"" staged by patients and staff.
By 1949, new treatments had been added to the traditional moral treatment (now called ""milieu therapy""). Electric and insulin shock treatments were now being used extensively, hypnosis and group therapy were employed and three lobotomies had been performed.
From Matteawan's opening, the proportion of chronic and dangerous patients - who could never be released - steadily rose, and so did the hospital count. Capacity was gradually increased to about 1,000, but overcrowding continued. In 1949, there were nearly 1,500 men and 250 women.
Outwardly, the madhouse atop Asylum Road was usually quiet. Its most notorious patient was probably George Metesky, the Mad Bomber. But Metesky caused no problems, and after his release lived uneventfully outside the state. Escape attempts offered occasional excitement. In 1933, four patients obtained pistols and held two attendants in a locked ward. State Police were called in and, when one of the patients pointed a gun, he was shot and killed by a trooper.
The End of the Prison Hospitals
By the mid- 1960's, the DOCS held approximately 3,000 patients at Matteawan and Dannemora state hospitals some serving sentence, some held past their sentences and many confined without ever having been convicted. Within a dozen years, all 3,000 would be gone. A series of court decisions ended the relatively free and easy procedures under which Matteawan and Dannemora had operated. Simply put, everyone sent there stayed until the superintendent approved their release. In many eases, persons committed for minor offenses were confined for 30 and 40 years. Now, coinciding with a period in American history when faith in the judgment of “experts"" was eroding, courts put a stop to the ""unbridled discretion"" exercised by mental institution superintendents.
First, the courts established that transfer to Matteawan or Dannemora would require the same procedures, including the right to a court hearing, as involuntary commitments of ordinary citizens to civil mental hospitals. A later decision established that nobody could be held in a correctional institution beyond their maximum sentence (if still dangerous, they could be committed to a civil hospital). Further decisions eliminated the transfer of ""dangerous civil patients,"" and then of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity, to institutions where convicted persons were also held. The effect of these decisions was to empty the prison mental hospitals. Dannemora was the first to go, in 1972. For another five years, Matteawan held convicted patients only, with all other categories of the criminally insane going to the Department of Mental Hygiene.
24-Hour Wonders: Classification Run Amok
The period 1966-77 was one of indecision and confusion as the Department struggled to decide what to do with prisoners formerly sent to Dannemora and Matteawan. New units and entire institutions were created, it seemed, every few months. They were easily set up because Matteawan's ward system had evolved to include self-contained units with their own kitchens.
The first new entry, in 1966, was originally called the Beacon Institution for Defective Delinquents, where inmates would be called ""biddies"" for years. Then, in a sudden show of official sensitivity, it was immediately renamed Beacon State Institution (BSI). BSI took the last defectives from Napanoch, whose population was also decimated by the court decision directing the release of inmates whose sentences had expired. A separate institution, Glenham Correctional Facility, was created also at Matteawan for ""borderline"" cases with IQ's of 70-85.
To take the unconvicted mentally ill persons who could no longer be legally held at Matteawan, the Mental Hygiene Department opened the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center on Matteawan's grounds.
Yet another mini-facility was created about this time. Fishkill Correctional Facility -- no relation to today's Fishkill --was the name given to a female unit to relieve crowding at Bedford Hills. In 1972, the unit accepted eight women considered uncontrollable at Bedford, which at that time had no special housing unit. The ""uncontrollables"" sued DOCS for illegally transferring them without a hearing. The inmates prevailed They were returned to Bedford and the Fishkill unit closed.
Emblematic of the vacillation at the institution was the now you-see-it, now-you-don't Center for Medical Services. In April 1973, DOCS Commissioner Russell U. Oswald decided to ""abolish"" the semi-independent Matteawan, Beacon, Glenham and Fishkill ""facilities"" and combined them in a ""Correctional Center for Medical Services at Beacon."" Not five month: later, newly appointed Commissioner Peter Preiser erased this Center and reestablished Matteawan, Beacon and Fishkill a' ""new institutions."" (Glenham, however, was not resurrected.)
CNYPC Replaces Matteawan, Modern Fishkill Emerges
In settlement of a suit, the state agreed that the Department of Mental Hygiene should assume responsibility for all mentally ill persons, including sentenced prisoners. On January 1, 1977, Mental Hygiene opened the Central New York Psychiatric Center (CNYPC) a special forensic mental health facility on the grounds of the Beacon complex (CNYPC was relocated to a portion of Marcy State Hospital in September of that year). With the creation of CNYPC, Matteawan closed forever.
Out of the chaos of the 1960s and '70s, today's Fishkill emerged. Fishkill is a medium security facility in the DOCS system, but it includes a minimum-security work release component and a maximum-security S-Block. In addition, Fishkill recently became home to a Regional Medical Unit.
Fishkill has shrunk in size since it owned and farmed 900 acres in the state hospital days. Parts of its property were appropriated for the Beacon Correctional Facility for women (on the site of the former Beacon Regional Training Center for Correction Officer trainees) and Downstate, a reception and classification center which opened in 1979.
Among the programs operated at Fishkill is the Correctional Industries (Corcraft) program. Inmates manufacture beds, chairs and computer furniture for sale to state and local governments. They also fabricate to order heavy gauge steel specialty items, such as security doors and windows, for correctional and psychiatric institutions. Some of the original buildings are in use now at Fishkill.

New York,Manhattan Psychiatric Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Manhattan_Psychiatric_Center,1868,1869,13 December 1871,"Active, Demolished (Kirkbride and original buildings)","Kirkbride Plan (Original Building), Metropolitan Plan (Current Buildings)",Alexander Jackson Davis,Manhattan State Hospital  | Ward's Island Lunatic Asylum | Ward's Island Asylum | New York City Lunatic Asylum Ward's Island.,"Since 1839 the City of New York had been operating an asylum on Blackwell's Island for the care of the city's insane. At the time the vast majority of the insane under municipal care were poor immigrants, which at the time were pouring into New York City. As a result the population of the Blackwell's Island Asylum had steadily risen and was maintained in a perpetual state of overcrowding, providing only custodial care. To combat the rising population the asylum built a three story building for violent patients and later expanded to a three story building, formerly a workshop for the neighboring workhouse. Finally a series of one story pavilions were built however by 1868 the asylum only had accommodation for 640 of the 1035 patients under their care. The lack of room for expansion on Blackwell's Island, already hosting the city Asylum, Prison, Almshouses, and Workhouse, caused the city to look elsewhere. Nearby Ward's Island had been owned by the Department of Emmigration since 1847 and was already home to other city institutions. As a result a site was picked and the new branch of the asylum was established in 1868, opening to patient on December 12, 1871.
In 1871 when the new branch of the New York City Insane Asylum opened Ward's Island already was home to the Verplank State Emigrant Hospital, on the north eastern side, as well was the New York City Inebriate Asylum on the Southwestern part of the island, just below the new Insane Asylum. The new hospital building was built constructed of brick and Ohio free-state in the English Gothic Style with a Mansard roof. It was built in the Kirkbride style, with a three story central building with wings staggered back en echelon on either side. The cost of this structure was $700,000, and its overall frontage was 475 feet, with accommodation for 500 patients.
Upon opening the Ward's Island Asylum became the Male Department of the New York City Insane Asylum system, and it operated independently from the original Asylum, now the Female Department, on Blackwell's Island. Immediately all male patients were shipped up river to this new building. Regrettably this new hospital was no real improvement and suffered from many defects. The eating and lighting proved to be inadequate, the furniture was crude and many patients did not even have eating utensils to use at meal time. The nurse to patient ratio was one to 30 while the physicians proved inexperienced, only serving at the Asylum until they had enough experience to move on. Attendants proved similarly inadequate, as did treatment of patients, with many being locked in their rooms. The patients often were mingled with no regard to disease annd with no treatment. On top of this it was almost immediately the hospital found itself again overcrowded and looking for more space.
In 1875 the Wards Island Asylum transferred some patients to the former Inebriate Asylum, which had recently closed. However that same year the Ward's Island Homeopathic Hospital, which in 1894 would move to the Asylum buildings on Blackwell's island, took control of the building. In 1877 patients were sent to an unoccupied three story building, know as the ""annex"", formerly used by the Emigration Department to house immigrants. The building, having only open barracks style bays on each floor proved less than ideal for care of the insane. In 1880 some patients were transferred to the Hart Island Asylum, a new branch which moved into Civil War era barracks formerly occupied by an industrial school. Their age and nature made them completely unsuitable for habitation by the mentally ill but they were forced to endure the conditions for several years.
Finally in 1878 Superintendent MacDonald requested a new wing to the original building, providing room for an additional 250 patients. For the sake of time and expedience a second ward on the other wing was also set to be built. Immediately patients and convicts from the work house set to work on the new additions to alleviate the overcrowding. Also under MacDonald there was a marked improvement in hospital management, food, and general welfare. He worked to not only ensure a better diet for the patients but also replaced the sub standard and uncomfortable furniture and increased the funding for patient amusement. In 1879 four lectures on insanity were given at the hospital to the student physicians, with crowd ranging from 20 to over 200 at each. These were the first lectures of their kind given at a New York Insane Hospital. By 1880 Dr. MacDonald succeeded in finally getting rid of the practice of using convicts in hospitals, arguing it brought an atmosphere of crime and depravity which held the hospitals progress back. In this year manual restraints were also abolished at the hospital.
Despite the dedication and commitment of Superintendent MacDonald to improve and administer the hospital as well as possible the ever increasing population led ever worsening conditions. In 1886 allegations of poor food and attendants were made and an investigation found the claims credible. As a result appropriations were increased and plans made for construction of more buildings. Attendants buildings were built on Wards Island as well as Hart's and Blackwell's. Improvement's included a sea bath which was cut into the rock on the southern end of the island to allow the waters of Hell gate to flow into it. A plunge bath was also built in the West wing of the kirkbride. The hospital at this time included carpenters and painters shops, a shoe shop, brush shot, a tailor, a printing office, and others. All work was done by the patients, with a requirement for release from the hospital being proficiency in one of these trades, to better serve the patients search for employment. A new dietary was enacted and buildings were begun on a newly purchased 1000 acre tract of land at Central Islip on Long Island. This new Farm Colony would later become Central Islip State Hospital.
By 1892 the Ward's Island asylum had maintained its integrity as the male department of the hospital, holding 2,498 male patients, almost 300 over capacity. However, this same year considerations were made regarding the transfer of female patients to the recently abandoned State Emigrant Hospital complex, vacant since the new Federal Emigration Station at Ellis Island opened earlier in the year.
During this year with the 2,500 female patients at Blackwell's Island, and the roughly 100 on Hart's the city asylum cared for around 6,000 people.
In 1894 all properties of the city asylums on Hart's, Ward's, and Blackwell's Islands, were leased to the state of New York from the city. The agreement was that the state would have use of these leased properties for a period of 15 years, after which time control of the properties would be turned back over to the City of New York. During this time it was agreed upon that the state would provide for increased accommodation for patients and evacuate the institutions on Hart's and Blackwell's Island within five years, and evacuate the Ward's Island institution by the end of the 15 year term. This three Asylum Complex was now called ""Manhattan State Hospital"".
In this same year a majority of the female patients from the Blackwell's Island Asylum were transferred to former Emigrant Hospital buildings, and the building used by the New York City Homeopathic Hospital, which in turn moved into the former asylum buildings on Blackwell's. Transfers to Ward's Island continued and by 1898 only 839 patients remained on facilities on Blackwell's.
In 1899 all patients from Hart's Island were transferred either to Ward's Island or the new facilities at Central Islip. The Hart's Island Asylum was closed at this time.
By 1898 the Wards Island Asylum had a population of 2,031 male and 1,468 female patients, with most of the females coming from Blackwell's. The total population of the asylum by 1899 was 4,393, making it the largest institution in the world at the time.
By February 1901 with Hart's Island's closure two years prior and the transfer of the last of the patients on Blackwell's Island to Central Islip the Ward's Island Asylum, divided into two departments, East and West, was all that remained under State control. In 1905 these two departments were merged by the state into Manhattan State Hospital, while the colony at Central Islip, formerly a department of this hospital, was separated into an independent entity. In 1907 it was suggested the lease on the Ward's Island properties be extended and in 1908 a fifty year lease was signed between New York City and New York State, with the agreement that the state would erect new hospital facilities on a modern plan. The Hospital continued to grow, reaching its peak population of 7,000 in 1926.
In February 1923 a fire at the hospital claimed the lives of 25 patients.
In 1934 Robert Moses took over as head of the NYC parks department and tri-boro bridge authority. His goal was a long unrealized plan of a bridge linking Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, and Ward's and Randall's Island were vital to this plan. Furthermore he envisioned both Islands as a vast complex of parks and public space, even planning for a large stadium. While he did get his goal realized in many ways, with the House of Refuge and most other institutions being demolished in by 1937 he ran into problems when the Manhattan State Hospital refused to leave. Though still housed in 19th century buildings and a state law mandating its closure by 1943 it prevailed and continued to operate due to overcrowding at the other state institutions.
In 1954 voters approved a $350 million bond for construction of new buildings, which were built on the site of the former Emigrant Refuge and Hospital. Ths new complex consisted of 3 large metropolitan plan buildings, however new facilities did not end the hospitals troubles. The 1960's and 70's brought many problems. Rapes and robberies occured at the hands of criminals who came onto campus due to poor security and in 1974 the Times reported recently transferred retarded patients were left in rooms idly while equipment for their development went unused because of under staffing and poor management. Shortly afterwards the Mayor of NYC accused the hospital of being unsanitary, keeping poor records, and distributing drugs carelessly.
Also in the late 1970s the Mayor opened a ""temporary"" homeless shelter for 200 men, which was the cause of much debate and controversy. After turning it over to a private organization (Volunteers of America) it grew to 500 residents by 1981. By 1990, with accusations of the residents stealing, exposing themselves to children, and other criminal acts the VOA were forced to greatly increase the security at the Shelter. Today it provides a home to 600 men.
In 1979 the Manhattan State Hospital was re-consolidated into its current Manhattan Psychiatric Center. In 1985 one of the buildings was separated from the Manhattan State Hospital to become the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, for violent and criminally insane patients. Today it bills itself as a modern hospital providing top notch care to its patients. The in-patient population in 1995 stood at 900 patients and as of 2010 only 260 are housed in the hospital. The hospital also has 90 patients living in transitional housing on the campus as well as over 600 regular outpatients.

New York,Middletown State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Middletown_State_Hospital,1870,1870,1874,Closed,Cottage Plan,Carl Pfeiffer,Middletown Homeopathic Hospital | Middletown Psychiatric Center,"This institution was originally founded in pursuance of an act of the legislature passed April 28, 1870, establishing at Middletown, in Orange county, a state lunatic asylum for ""the care and treatment of the insane and the inebriate upon the principles of medicine known as homœopathic."" The movement, however, which led to the ultimate establishment of the hospital had its inception in the address of John Stanton Gould before the State Homœopathic Medical Society at its session in Albany in February, 1866. The subject of the orator's discourse was ""The Relation of Insanity to Bodily Disease,"" and in the course of his remarks attention was called to the necessity of a new state asylum for lunatic's in the southern tier counties of the state, and claimed as a matter of justice that when organized the institution should be placed under the homœopathic school of medicine.
This seems to have been the crystallizing point of the earnest desire of the homœopathic profession throughout the state, for at the next meeting of the state society in February, 1867, a resolution was offered by Dr. Paine of Albany to the effect that ""Whereas, a bill authorizing the erection of a new lunatic asylum is now pending before the legislature,"" therefore a committee should be appointed to prepare a memorial asking ""for such action as shall place said institution under the care of the homœopathic school.""
But notwithstanding the laudable efforts of the advocates of the enterprise and their apparent zeal for its consummation, nothing was accomplished until some years afterward. In the meantime, however, Dr. Hilon Doty had come forward with a proposition to turn over his private asylum, ""Margarettsville Retreat for the Insane,"" to a board of trustees or managers of an incorporated institution under homœopathic control, and while an act of incorporation was secured in 1869 through the influence of the state medical society, nothing was done until December of that year, when Dr. George E. Foote of Middletown presented to the homœopathic profession a plan to establish an insane asylum, founded by subscription and endowment, and organized as a close corporation. This proposition met with favor, and sufficient subscriptions were received to insure success, but it soon became necessary to give the institution a more public character and to enlist state support. Accordingly, it was planned to make it a state asylum ; the time was deemed ripe for such a movement, and the governor in his last message had pointed out the need of better and more accommodations for the insane charges upon the public bounty.
The friends of the movement were quick to see their opportunity and threw themselves earnestly into the work, leaving no stone unturned until their desires were gratified in the passage of an act, April 28, 1870, establishing a state lunatic asylum at Middletown under homœopathic management. It was not the first homœopathic asylum in the world, as has been asserted, but was the first of its kind in America under purely homœopathic management. It was formally opened for patients, April 20, 1874. The name was changed in conformity to the provisions of an act of the legislature, and then became known as Middletown State Homœopathic Hospital.
Middletown Psychiatric Center (MPC) offers contemporary treatment for adults with complex mental illnesses. The goal of treatment is recovery. Treatment and rehabilitation by an inter-disciplinary team of mental health professionals aim at equipping patients to manage their illness, strengthen their skills and better the quality of their lives. MPC¹s inpatient units and administration are located in Tuckerman Hall with Outpatient and Residential Services throughout Orange and Sullivan counties.
MPC's innovative 25,000 square foot Treatment Mall brings together, in one location, contemporary treatment and rehabilitation, specialized programs to build daily life skills, indoor and outdoor activities, hobbies and patient services. This program has been replicated in over 25 hospitals in 7 states.
MPC offers programs to meet patients' individual treatment requirements while responding with sensitivity to their diverse cultural backgrounds and needs. Specialized services include programs for: co-occurring disorders of mental illness and substance abuse; geriatric patients participating in the community through volunteer work (e.g., Meals on Wheels); patients requiring a structured, secure treatment setting; patients in need of comprehensive skills building; cognitive remediation to improve intellectual functioning.
MPC participates with Columbia University and Psychiatric Institute in advanced psychiatric training in Geriatric and Public Psychiatry. MPC serves as a nexus for consultations and dissemination of knowledge to the community, from information about new medications to assistance in the design of humane residential environments. Fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Health Care Organizations, Middletown Psychiatric Center has an outstanding record in surveys conducted by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Federal Health Care Finance Administration.
MPC has pioneered the development of a Community Campus, a dramatic departure from the isolation of traditional psychiatric hospitals. The hospital now shares the 226 acre grounds with a full spectrum of mutually supportive public and non-profit agencies serving the community in the areas of mental health, health, education, human services, housing and economic development. For patients, the Community Campus means convenient access to community services and skills building programs. By breaking down barriers which historically separated hospital from community, the stigma of mental illness is reduced.[1]
In the mid to late 1900’s, attendance at Middletown dwindled, as it did in all American asylums at the time, due to deinstitutionalization and refinancing of state medical care. Middletown changed is focus to outpatient programs, but ultimately closed in 2006. Various social services and rehab facilities continued to operate on the campus, which was mostly abandoned.

The reformatory was later taken over by the state and still later, in the 1970's, it was converted to a forensic psychiatric hospital to replace the old Matteawan asylum in Fishkill. Another property in nearby Chester was operated as a farm colony for women offenders. Today, it is a shelter for homeless New York City men.
Today Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center (MHFPC) is a secure adult psychiatric center that provides a comprehensive program of evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation for patients admitted by court order. These admissions are consequent to judicial findings of ""incompetent to stand trial"" or ""not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect."" [1]It is home to more than 250 men and women deemed both mentally ill and too violent for society. It is the largest forensic facility in New York state.
Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center will close by 2017 under a consolidation plan by the state Office of Mental Health. The closure is included in a plan to overhaul the state’s psychiatric services over the next four years by consolidating 24 inpatient hospitals statewide into 15 regional centers and establishing more than two dozen outpatient service hubs.

On October 17, 1909, the State Commission in Lunacy purchased 550 acres on Lake Mohansic for $135,000, with the intention of building an asylum to accommodate 2,000 (later 6,000) patients to relieve the overcrowding of institutions in New York City. The property was later expanded to 660 acres, with an additional 490 acres for the New York State Training School for Boys. Dr. Isham G. Harris became superintendent of Mohansic State Hospital in 1910. On June 16, 1910, 12 patients were transferred to the institution from the Central Islip State Hospital.
In 1911, a spur from the New York and Putnam Railroad was built from Yorktown Heights and across Crom Pond to the site. Construction of the hospital was underway, starting with three ""cottages"" which housed 165 inmates. Strang Cottage was the site of the murder of 19 year-old hospital attendant Charles Wiley, Jr. on July 4, 1913.
In 1916 continued construction on the asylum became the subject of heated debate. Senator Robert F. Wagner cited concerns of pollution to the New Croton Reservoir and the New York City water supply from sewage the asylum would produce, and Senator Henry M. Sage cited the considerable amount the State had already spent developing the property at New York City's request. New York State Governor Charles S. Whitman eventually ordered construction stopped to protect the watershed, and in 1918 he signed a bill which abandoned the hospital project. The funds for Mohansic were re-appropriated for use in construction of an asylum in upstate New York, and the property was converted to a state park in 1918. The site is currently occupied by Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park.",1918,"Yorktown Heights, NY",,

New York,Pilgrim State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pilgrim_State_Hospital,1928,1929,1930,Active,Cottage Plan,Starrett & Van Vleck,Pilgrim Psychiatric Center,"At the time it was opened, it was the largest hospital of any type in the world. Its size has never been exceeded by any other facility, although today Pilgrim is far smaller than it used to be.
By 1900, overcrowding in city asylums was becoming a major problem that many tried to resolve. One answer was to put the mentally ill to work farming in a relaxing setting on what was then rural Long Island. The new state hospitals were dubbed ""Farm Colonies"" because of their live-and-work treatment programs, agricultural focus and patient facilities. However, these farm colonies, the Kings Park State Hospital (later known as the Kings Park Psychiatric Center) and the Central Islip State Hospital (later known as the Central Islip Psychiatric Center), quickly became overcrowded, just like the earlier institutions they were supposed to replace.
NY state responded by making plans for a third so-called farm colony, what was to become the Pilgrim State Hospital, named in honor of the former New York State Commissioner of Mental Health, Dr. Charles W. Pilgrim. The state bought up approx. 1,000 acres (4.0 km²) of land in Brentwood and began construction in 1930. The hospital opened on October 1, 1931 as a close knit community with its own police and fire department, courts, post office, a LIRR station, power plant, potter's field, swinery, cemetery, water tower and houses for doctors, psychiatrists, and asylum administrators. A series of underground tunnels were used for routing steam pipes and other vital utilities.
The hospital would continue to grow as the patient population increased. Eventually, the state of New York bought up more land to the southwest of the facility to construct Edgewood State Hospital, a short-lived stand-alone facility that operated under Pilgrim's umbrella. In fact, Pilgrim State was so large that it reached into four Suffolk townships- Huntington, Babylon, Smithtown and Islip- and had two major state roads passing through its bounds.
During World War II, the War Department took over control of the entire Edgewood facility along with three new buildings at Pilgrim, buildings 81, 82, and 83 (visible from the Long Island Expressway and still used today). The War Department constructed numerous temporary structures and operated Edgewood and buildings 81-83 as ""Mason General Hospital,"" a psychiatric hospital devoted to treating battle-traumatized soldiers. Famed filmmaker John Huston, who received a special commission in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, made a documentary at Mason called ""Let There Be Light"" that showed the effects of war on mental health. The film sparked a firestorm of controversy and was not seen by the public until 1981.
After the war, Pilgrim experienced a surge in patient numbers that made it the world's largest hospital, topping out at 13,875 patients and over 4,000 employees in 1954. Around this time, the old ""rest and relaxation"" philosophy gave way to more extreme measures like pre-frontal lobotomies and electro-shock therapy. However, Pilgrim and the other state hospitals began to decline shortly afterwards with the arrival of pharmaceutical alternatives to institutionalization.
As medicine and community care became a viable alternative to institutionalization, large mental institutions began to decline. Edgewood, the last completed Long Island asylum, closed its doors in December 1971 following decentralization. Kings Park and Central Islip continued operation, while at the same time downsizing. Pilgrim was not exempt from this downsizing either, and parts of the campus began to close throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. Buildings 81-83 were briefly used as a correctional facility in the 1980s as a result of Pilgrim's mass downsizing, but after much community protest they reverted back to psychiatric use. In the early 1990s, with declining patient populations in the three remaining hospitals, the New York State Office of Mental Health (formerly the Department of Mental Hygiene) began making plans to re-organize the Long Island hospitals. The plans were implemented in the fall of 1996, when Kings Park and Central Islip were formally shuttered, and the remaining patients from both those facilities were transferred to Pilgrim. The Central Islip site partly became a campus for the New York Institute of Technology, but was also used for residential and commercial development or left abandoned. At Kings Park, three buildings housing community residences administered by Pilgrim remain open. Much of the former campus has become a state park, while the rest sits in abandonment.
Pilgrim is today the last of the state asylums still operating on Long Island. However, it is no longer what it used to be. The farming section of the hospital was sold off, renovated, and became the Western Campus of the Suffolk County Community College in 1974. A large part of the Pilgrim campus was sold to a developer, and numerous abandoned structures on those lands were demolished in recent years. However, rebuilding has not begun. Other abandoned structures, like the former administration building, medical/surgical building, doctor's residences were demolished in 2012. The power plant and utilities section remain standing for the time being (those parts of the campus are owned by the developer as well). Only about a third of the original Pilgrim campus is still in operation, though its future is also cloudy.
Pilgrim also hosts a museum on site, which displays items from Kings Park, Central Islip, Pilgrim, and Edgewood such as pictures, old newsletters, relics from abandoned and/or demolished buildings, and other historical information that hint back to a largely forgotten era.

Opened in 1904, Ray Brook was the first New York State-operated tuberculosis sanatorium, and the second in the United States, after Massachusetts. After a protracted study of alternative sites, New York State chose to establish its hospital in the highly-regarded fresh air of the Adirondack Mountains, near the critical mass of tuberculosis experts in Saranac Lake.
Although medical developments made sanatoria obsolete starting in the mid-1950s, the State Hospital at Ray Brook continued to operate until the mid-1960s. The property was then transferred from the Department of Health to the new Drug Addiction Control Commission, combining enforcement and treatment; in 1971 the new facility opened as the Ray Brook Rehabilitation Center, housing 70 to 130 women addicts. However, it was judged a failure, and closed within five years. It was succeeded by a camp program for adult inmates, ""Camp Adirondack"". Working with the Department of Environmental Conservation, ""campmen"", as inmates were known, were employed in logging, sawmill, wildlife preservation, construction of campsites and snowmobile and cross-country ski trails, and construction of a toboggan run at the Mount Pisgah ski area. The camp also constructed the Ice Palace each winter for the Saranac Lake Winter Carnival.
With the selection of Lake Placid for the 1980 Winter Olympics the inmates worked on the Olympic trails at Mount Van Hoevenburg. The camp facilities were used for Olympic staff housing, which led to renovation of the water treatment plant, sewage system, housing and food service areas. During the games, the inmates were relocated to other prison facilities in the state, and were replaced by 900 State Police and 300 U.S. Customs Bureau personnel, National Guard and security forces of foreign governments who provided security for the Games. Two hundred acres of the Camp Adirondack was used as the site for the Olympic Village; after the games it became a new federal prison, the Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook.
The newly improved facilities allowed a substantial increase in the prison population, which led to the erection of the first security fence around the perimeter of the complex. In 1981, Camp Adirondack was designated a medium-security facility and renamed the Adirondack Correctional Facility. It presently is rated as a 700-man, medium-security prison, and employs 311.[1]

By 1857 they found the need to open a separate wing of the building simply to house and treat the poor who were mentally disabled. The number of patients in the separate wing had increased so dramatically by 1862 that it was necessary to expand into a separate building the housed only the mentally disabled and insane. This separate building was named the Monroe County Insane Asylum.
New York State Legislature passed a bill providing funding for the establishment of state hospitals to care for the insane in 1890, and by July 1, 1891 Monroe County Insane Asylum became Rochester State Hospital. It's current name, Rochester Psychiatric Center, was changed in the early 1970's though it remains a state funded hospital. The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office currently operates a forensic unit at the center.

New York,Rockland State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rockland_State_Hospital,1926,1927,1931,Active,Cottage Plan,,Rockland Psychiatric Center,"Construction began in 1927 on a 600-acre rural campus, Rockland State Hospital, as it was then known, initially had 5,768 beds. With a working farm, its own power plant and industrial shops staffed by patients who manufactured everything from mattresses to brooms and furniture, Rockland was then considered among the best-planned psychiatric hospitals in the world. In 1931 the hospital opened to 60 male patients, all transfers from Manhattan State Hospital.
""The hospital fostered the idea of the therapeutic suburb,"" Andrea Bergbower, a sophomore social work major, said. ""The thought was that it would be beneficial for these patients to leave the noise and pollution of the city for the isolation of the suburbs to bring them out of their illness."" Within 10 years, Rockland's population grew exponentially, along with such attendant problems as overcrowding, disease and staff shortages.
""Much of the staff was drafted during World War II and replaced with nonqualified workers,"" Sara Fisher, a junior studying psychology at Marymount, said. ""Beds were placed in day rooms; infections spread, and there was just one psychologist to care for each 300 patients.""
By 1959, the peak year for admittance, Rockland had more than 9,000 residents (including a staff of 2,000). The students, some of whom plan to pursue careers in mental health, studied the history of treating mental illness through archival research and first-hand interviews. At Rockland, insulin shock therapy was begun in 1937, followed by electroshock treatment and lobotomies. The students appeared visibly affected by seeing and handling some of the surgical instruments, all used, their teachers told them, not out of cruelty but as part of what was then considered state-of-the-art treatment.
Other therapy used was seclusion rooms with a single frosted glass window, a single bed, and a toilet, with a split door with a food service door at the center. Generally three days was the duration given to uncontrollable patients. According to an interviewed patient interned in the early 1940's primarily for being a child that was a discipline problem for her parents, and not having a mental illness, her parents through social services had her interned her at 9 years old for almost a year. Ice sheet baths were given as punishment for unruly, or uncooperative patients, as well as isolation punishments. Also among the girls there was a status social structure that established ones rank through fighting at night. Mostly an open dorm, community bed area was where patients were locked up together at night with staff interacting primarily during daytime hours only. There were 6 cottages for children. Three for girls and three for boys. Also as a non-professional opinion the patient felt that many of her fellow patients were interned due to being physically or mentally abused by family, and we're not diagnosed with mental illness, but became discipline problems, and therefore were made wards of the state.
""In the early years there was very little anesthetic used,"" Loraine Milosevic, a Marymount junior, said. ""They didn't even have teeth clamps to prevent those patients getting lobotomies from biting their tongues."" The students learned about treatments for schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, ranging from hydrotherapy ( placing a patient into freezing water in a bathtub to calm the person) to repainting the institution's walls to affect the patient's psyche. (Pink, it turned out, is the most soothing color and today is found in almost all hospitals.)
For Dr. Kaiser, who worked at Rockland for 13 years as a psychiatric social worker, going back with her students was also an enlightening experience. ""I went in there at the beginning of the process of deinstitutionalization when there were patients who had been there for 30 years,"" Dr. Kaiser said. ""I knew a woman who had been institutionalized since she was 6 years old for epilepsy and didn't even know how to turn on a light. It was very exciting to take students there to learn how far we've come in terms of treating mental illnesses in this country.""
Since the 1970's, Rockland Psychiatric Center has served mainly as an outpatient hospital and today houses fewer than 600 patients, primarily the most seriously ill. With the advent of new psychotropic drugs and vocational training, many patients with schizophrenia and manic depression who had been institutionalized are now able to live independently so long as they take medication.[1]

The main lot is the burial site for 1,634 mentally ill patients who were institutionalized at Rockland Psychiatric Center in the early 20th century, abandoned by their families or society because of the shame and stigma attached to mental illness at the time. Another cemetery at Rockland Psychiatric Center has 794 graves of people buried from 1965 to the present. The old cemetery, where residents were buried from 1928 to 1965, will be called the Broad Acres cemetery, and the newer one will be named Blaisdell cemetery.

The Center also operates a specialized eight-bed inpatient unit for monolingual Chinese persons from New York City who are in need of intermediate-level inpatient psychiatric care. In recognition of its outstanding quality of care,its leadership in providing cutting-edge treatment for serious psychiatric disorders (e.g.,Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and APA Guidelines-based pharmacotherapies), and its contribution to the communities it serves, in 2015, New York State contracted for the construction of a new, state-of-the art, $350 million dollar inpatient facility on the Center's Staten Island main campus, to replace the existing inpatient buildings that opened in 1973. The new building was set to open in early 2020. However, as a result of the overwhelming impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in New York City at the time, New York State temporarily arranged for the Northwell Health System to staff and operate the new building and use it to treat Covid patients who had overwhelmed the existing NYC hospital infrastructure. Then, in September 2021, with the Covid crisis mitigated in NYC, the entire South Beach Psychiatric Center inpatient program moved into the new building.

Initially, it was to be call the Ogdensburg State Asylum for the Insane, but the name was changed to the St. Lawrence State Hospital before the first patient was admitted. In the late 1970's, it was re-christened the St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center.
The asylum was authorized in 1886 by the state Legislature after being persuaded of the need for such an institution in the northern part of the state. The governor appointed a site selection commission including Dr. Peter M. Wise (superintendent of the Willard State Hospital) and William P. Letchworth (a member of the state Board of Charities who was also instrumental in establishing what is now Groveland). They recommended Point Airy, a 950-acre tract of farmland bulging out into the St. Lawrence River The state purchased the land for $188,000 in 1887.
Later that year Isaac G. Perry, the state architect, consulted a group of experts to plan the asylum. Among them were Dr. Wise and Dr. Carlos F. MacDonald. Dr MacDonald was superintendent of the Auburn State Asylum for Insane Criminals and, when that was relocated, he became the first superintendent of Matteawan State Hospital (now Fishkill). Dr. MacDonald was present at the world's first execution by electrocution, and his graphic report on William Kemmler's death at Auburn in 1890 is frequently cited in death penalty studies.
Their ideas laid the foundation for the family-style institution that would become standard in the design and conduct of future psychiatric hospitals. Plans drawn by the architect called for three discrete groups of buildings, so that patients could be grouped according to their particular psychiatric disorder. The buildings would be small, not exceeding two floors, with sleeping quarters above and rooms for day activities below.
The St. Lawrence State Hospital opened on December 9, 1890, under the superintendency of Dr. Wise, who transferred from Willard. Dr Wise instituted a program of ""moral treatment,"" designed to rescue the patient from the outside pressures that were widely thought to cause insanity. The ""moral"" inmoral treatment refers not to ethics but rather, as in the phrase ""moral support,"" to ""morale."" Conceived before the advent of drug therapy and other medical interventions, moral treatment meant an attitude and an environment: a nurturing routine of rest without stress in comforting surroundings.
Recreation, as a mental stimulant, was an important component of the therapeutic program. Entertainments included stereopticon shows, musical and comedy productions, sleigh rides, popcorn parties, phonographic entertainments, camping on Lotus Island, skating and sledding in the winter and, in summer, river excursions on ""Dorothy"" (the hospital steamboat). Dancing was also encouraged, because it combined physical exercise with what is, in Dr. Wise's scale, ""the most potent of all the factors of moral treatment - music.""
Recreation was only one form of ""purposeful activity"" by which St. Lawrence strove to arouse previously unreachable patients from apathy. In 1908, St. Lawrence pioneered a fledgling occupational therapy program, described as ""employment in various occupations for the purpose of re-educating the facilities of attention and volition."" It would be imitated in state hospitals all over the country. Patients worked at weaving, sewing, woodworking and knitting (using wool from the hospital flock).
The hospital, like prisons of the day, resembled a self-supporting community. The farm was so productive that outside food purchases were seldom necessary; it also supplied the patients' tobacco needs. The farm closed in the 1960's, after changes in state law concerning patient labor. The land was sold to the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority for industrial development. In 1928, St. Lawrence instituted a beauty salon, another first that was soon widely imitated in recognition of its therapeutic value as a morale booster.
The nursing school was another first for St. Lawrence. When the hospital opened in 1890, there were only 23 schools of nursing in the U.S., and only 11 had been in existence long enough to have produced graduates. Dr. Wise reasoned that it would be easier to train his own nurses than to recruit them. In 1890, before the first patients arrived, he established a coed nursing school, the first such school affiliated with a state institution. No suitable texts were available, so Dr. Wise wrote his own which became the standard text in all Department of Mental Hygiene nursing schools. In 1913, the curriculum was expanded from two years to three.
In 1972, with its in-patient population declining, New York started phasing out its costly nursing schools. St. Lawrence's program, operating out of the Flower Building, was the last to close (in 1981).

It was built next to the Auburn State Prison, but surrounded by a 12 foot high wall. The Auburn Asylum was created to hold convicted and sentenced persons who had become mentally ill. But this did not resolve the problem. Civil commitments, including persons not convicted by reason of insanity, were still the responsibility of the Utica State Hospital. In addition, many of the indicted but unsentenced persons were extremely deluded and dangerous, and managing them was as difficult and hazardous as the custody of convicted insane persons.
Utica State Hospital gradually pressed for authority to transfer such persons to the Auburn Asylum, and Auburn soon was overcrowded with the convicted and unconvicted of both sexes. In 1892, a new prison mental hospital was built at Matteawan and soon after, in 1899, another was in place at Dannemora.",1893,"Auburn, NY",,
New York,Syracuse Psychopathic Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Syracuse_Psychopathic_Hospital,1926,,1930,Active,Single Building,,Syracuse Psychiatric Hospital | Richard H. Hutchings Psychiatric Center (Current),"A lecture heard in New York City in 1925 inspired the establishment of Syracuse Psychopathic Hospital.  Dr. Herman G. Weiskotten, dean of Syracuse University College of Medicine, heard the lecture, in which Dr. C. Floyd Haviland outlined the then proposed Columbia-Presbyterian project and announced the participation of the State Hospital Commission in it.  The creation of a medical center at Syracuse was just then under consideration, and Dr. Weiskotten returned home convinced that it should contain a psychiatric unit.
The idea was promptly seconded by the chancellor of the university, Dr. Charles W. Flint, who agreed that if a psychiatric hospital was regarded as essential in the New York City undertaking it was even more necessary at Syracuse, the only large city in the state not served directly by a state hospital.  The lack of such a facility was felt not only by the university medical faculty but by the people of Onondaga, Madison, Cortland, Oswego and Cayuga counties, as it was estimated that 300 mental patients came yearly from the area which had a rural population of 500,000 in addition to the city's 200,000.  Syracuse had only a four-bed municipal ""hospital"" to comply with the mental hygiene law prohibiting detention of psychotic persons in jails while awaiting commitment.
The very active Onondaga County Health Association mental hygiene committee lent warm support to the new plan; the State Hospital Commission and the Board of Estimate and Control acknowledged the need for more adequate provision for mental patients; Syracuse University offered to donate land for the purpose; and finally, the state legislature acted to authorize establishment of the hospital by the laws of 1926.
By the end of 1930 construction of the T-shaped, 3-story building was sufficiently advanced so that it was possible to furnished some rooms.  On December 26 the first patient arrived.  From then on patients were received steadily, although it had not been intended to open the hospital until the following year.  Acceleration of admissions was made necessary by the closing, sooner than expected, of the old municipal facility.
With a capacity of 60 beds, the new hospital was designed for the reception of borderline and acutely psychotic persons who were to be studied, diagnosed and treated, and wherever possible returned to the community in a relatively short time.  An amendment made to include state institutions in that section of the mental hygiene law pertaining to temporary observation permitted holding patients on that basis for 30 days (later changed to 60 days) without court certification.  Few patients  have been retained longer than the observation period; if not recovered by that time, they are certified for transfer to larger state hospitals better prepared to handle continued treatment cases, although this has been necessary for only about one-third of the 15,000 patients admitted in the past 25 years.  Patients are referred by physicians, social agencies, health officers and judges, and in many instances by former patients who have returned home after making satisfactory adjustments in the hospital.
For  many years the hospital has been active in the teaching of the medical students and interns.  There is also a regular course of instruction for the residents of the upstate institutions of the Department of Mental Hygiene.  On February 18, 1953, this hospital was officially approved for three years of training, thus meeting fully the requirements of the American Board of Neurology and Psychiatry for the diplomat's examination.  Our teaching program included facilities for social workers and psychological interns.
The treatment program continues to be emphasized.  Individual psychotherapy is used to the largest extent possible.  With the discovery of the new tranquilizing drugs, which have been used extensively in this hospital since 1954, fewer patients have required shock therapy, although this former treatment still continues to be of great value.
Occupational Therapy has been a part of the treatment program since the first year, with all patients performing some sort of work and attending classes.  The usual arts and crafts have been introduced, and articles are made to  be used in the hospital or sold at Christmas time.  Suitable recreation has been introduced as part of the therapeutic program.  There are frequent parties with card games and dancing.  The patients' library, which is also managed by this department, contains several hundred books which are freely used by the patients.
The hospital contains a small laboratory, in addition to which the staff has ready access to the University and County laboratories.  Among the subjects of research have been amphetamine therapy, clinical use of barbital preparations, treatment of Parkinsonian syndromes, antabuse therapy in alcoholism, and for the past two years there has been intensive research on the newer drugs Chlorpromazine, Reserpine, Ritalin, and Meprobromate.  Quite recently an arrangement was made with the New York State University College of Medicine allowing them the use of one ward for the training of residents and students.
The first clinic at the Syracuse Psychopathic Hospital was conducted in January, 1931.  At present clinics are scheduled for every afternoon with three mornings a week being used for intake interviews by the social service department.  These clinics are well attended and serve not only discharged patients but people of all ages from the community and also follow-up and after-care cases from the various state hospitals who reside in Syracuse and vicinity.  Psychological examinations are given to children and adults referred by psychiatrists and by various agencies.  Electroencephalographic services were provided for by the New York State Boxing Commission and the various social agencies when referred by the attending physicians.  Consultation services are also provided to various Courts in order to help in the rehabilitation of the offenders.

It was originally called the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica. The Greek Revival structure was designed by Captain William Clarke and was funded through a combination of money provided by the state and contributions raised by Utica residents.
The asylum's first director was Dr. Amariah Brigham, who in 1844 became one of the original founders of American Psychiatric Association. An early proponent of treating mental illness rather than simply confining its sufferers, Dr. Brigham believed that his patients would benefit from the opportunity to work on the asylum's farm and grounds and on other useful occupational projects. Dr. Brigham established a print shop at the asylum, where he published the American Journal of Insanity (later known as the American Psychiatric Journal).
The asylum was also the site of the invention of ""The Utica Crib"". The Utica Crib was named after the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica where it was heavily used in the 19th century to confine patients. The crib was based on a French design, then modified to incorporated slats that gave it an appearance similar to a child's crib. While use of the Utica Crib was widely criticized and infamous among patients, some found it to have important therapeutic value. A patient who slept in the Utica crib for several days commented that he had rested better and found it useful for ""all crazy fellows as I, whose spirit is willing, but whose flesh is weak."" (Journal of Insanity, October 1864.) In an opposing view, Daniel Tuke, a noted British alienist (an early term for a psychology expert) writes that, ""it inevitably suggests, when occupied, that you are looking at an animal in a cage. At the celebrated Utica Asylum... where a suicidal woman was preserved from harm by this wooden enclosure... Dr. Baker of the New York Retreat allowed himself to be shut up in one of these beds, but preferred not remaining there.""[1]
The building has been a National Historic Landmark since 1989.

New York,Willard State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Willard_State_Hospital,"April 8, 1865",July 1866,October 1869,Closed,Kirkbride Plan,William H. Willcox,Willard Asylum for the Chronic Pauper Insane | Willard State Asylum,"In 1853, the site was acquired for the state's first agricultural college. The college - on 440 acres of farmland in the town of Ovid, ""the geographical centre and Eden of the Empire State"" - opened in December 1860, but it didn't last long. Within months, its president and most of the teachers and students marched off to fight in the Civil War, and the college never reopened. It was superseded by the new state university, established in Ithaca on land donated by state Senator Ezra Cornell.
Soon afterward, the site was earmarked for the Willard Asylum for the Insane, which would represent a second and major step toward transferring responsibility for the care of the mentally ill to the state. From colonial times, the care of insane persons had been a local function. Each county operated a poorhouse, or almshouse, wherein was indiscriminately lodged a hodgepodge of dependant persons: the mad, the feebleminded, the aged and crippled, drunks, epileptics and beggars. The almshouses provided custody and shelter, but ""treatment"" was not in their vocabulary.
The first step toward state assumption of responsibility was the opening of the Utica Lunatic Asylum in 1843. Utica was established as a treatment facility. It was reserved for new, acute eases and was required by law to return to county custody any patient who was not discharged as recovered within two years. Still condemned to the almshouse were the incurables, who, contrary to the unreal expectations of early asylum enthusiasts, were the norm among the pauper lunatic class. Dorothea Dix, among others including the underfunded county superintendents of the poor, drew the Legislature's attention to the unspeakable plight of the chronically ill.
Finally, in 1864, the Legislature appointed Dr. Sylvester D. Willard to investigate conditions in almshouses, jails and other places where the insane were kept. His report of neglect, abuse and suffering led to the passage - six days before Lincoln's assassination - of a bill calling for a second state asylum, specifically designated for the care of the chronic insane. The asylum, located on the site of the abandoned Ovid Agricultural College, was named in memory of Dr. Willard, who died of typhoid fever just days before passage of the bill he authored.
In 1866, construction began on a large asylum building (razed in the early 1980's). Like the Eastern and Great Meadow prisons, the asylum was built on the approved institutional design of the day: a three-story center structure for administration with long wings radiating from either side for patient housing, males in one wing and females in the other.
On Oct. 13,1869, a steamboat docked at Ovid Landing and several men led a deformed, demented woman down the gangplank; Mary Rote, the asylum's first patient, had been chained for 10 years without a bed and without clothing in a cell in the Columbia County almshouse.
Three more patients, males, arrived at the dock that day, all in irons, one ""in what looked like a chicken crate, 3 1/2 feet square. Many of the early patients had been considered difficult and were ""quieted"" by regular flogging, dousing and ""pulleying"" (hanging by the thumbs) in the almshouses. Within days of their arrival at the new asylum, however, they were bathed, dressed, fed and, usually, resting quietly on the wards.
Within a few months, admissions outstripped the building's 250-bed capacity, and the former college building, high on the hill overlooking the lake, was renovated as housing for higher-functioning patients. The Grandview, the oldest structure on the grounds, is still in use today. The Finger Lakes Federal Credit Union has offices in the Grandview, and DOCS uses it as a training building.
By the end of the first year, with the census approaching 700, Willard began to construct ""detached buildings"" away from the main building. The detached buildings housed working patients and their attendants. Work on the Sunnycroft, a salmon colored, two-story structure, began in 1872. It was rehabilitated in 1962 at a cost of $900,000 and is today enclosed within the DTC fence. Sunnycroft has eight 50-bed dormitories as well as offices and activity rooms.
Another detached structure from the 1870's, Edgemere, located outside the security fence, is now used by the DTC for training and staff functions of the type typically held in Quality of Work Life buildings.
Willard was growing rapidly. By 1890, when the name was changed to Willard State Hospital and its function enlarged to include acute as well as chronic patients, the census hit 2,000. Willard grew outward, gathering neighboring properties for farmland, and of course kept building, eventually topping 70 buildings large and small.
Among later structures were the Birches (1934) and Hatch Building (1951); both, along with Sunnycroft, are inside the DTC security fence. The Birches (two magnificent birch trees frame the entryway) is used for parolee housing, classrooms, vocational shops and offices. Hatch is used for housing and is also the DTC administration building.[1]
After the closure of the Willard Psychiatric Center, some of the grounds were largely abandoned, with several buildings deteriorating. Part of the grounds became the Willard Drug Treatment Campus. Some of its buildings are used as training facilities and dormitories by the Department of Correctional Facilities, which maintains the grounds.

On May 6, 1857, the Port of New York Quarantine Hospital in Tompkinsville, about a mile north along the shore, was attacked by a local mob, fearful that the mostly immigrant detainees on the grounds might be capable of spreading contagious diseases to the local populace. The next year, on September 1, 1858, a mob again attacked the hospital, burning it down. At this time, the duties and patients of the Quarantine were moved to two small islands off Staten Island.
In 1874, some of these resources were transferred to the Marine Hospital Service buildings. By 1883, the entire complex of buildings was operated as the United States Marine Hospital. The “National Institutes of Health” as the laboratory became known, operated out of the attic rooms from 1887 to 1891. The building that housed the laboratory still stands and is part of the former Bayley Seton Hospital complex. In 1902, the United States Congress passed legislation to fund the “Laboratory of Hygiene for Bacteriological Investigation,” and moved it to Washington where, as a result of the 1930 Ransdell Act, it became the National Institutes of Health. Staten Island once again was the founding home of a nationally recognized and successful venture for the good of the American population.
In the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt began a campaign to construct and maintain U.S. Public Health Service Hospitals, to serve the Military, veterans, and the general public. As part of this process, what is now the main building of Bayley Seton was constructed. Staten Island Public Health Service Hospital was built as a five- to seven-story hospital, in a Mayan Revival style.
Until 1981, the Public Health Service Hospital operated both in-patient and out-patient services, emergency, surgery, and rehabilitation wards. In 1980, President Reagan announced plans to close or sell all such hospitals, and despite local protest, Staten Island’s Public Health Service Hospital was sold to the Sisters of Charity, New York, a Catholic medical and social services system. The Sisters of Charity renamed the hospital Bayley Seton after New York’s Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, and her father Richard Bayley, an American-born British Army Revolutionary War surgeon and founder of the New York Dispensary. Bayley also was the head of the Quarantine Station for the port of New York at Tompkinsville.
The new hospital expanded its campus buildings to include the Saint Elizabeth Ann out-patient clinics and turned over part of the campus to the New York Foundling Hospital. In the 1990s, Amethyst House, a women’s drug abuse treatment center, was opened, as well as an Alcoholism Acute Care Unit on the 3rd floor, a Saint Vincent’s Nursing School on the fifth floor, social service agencies in other buildings, including the Saint Elizabeth Ann’s Health Care and Rehabilitation Center, with hospital in-patient drug rehab treatment services, services for co-occurring mental and substance abuse disorders, a psych emergency center (a Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program — CPEP), and the center for a mental health client dispersed housing and in-community employment program.
Though the hospital complex is barely used today, as compared to the bustling activity there in years past, it still is a remarkable campus of 19th and 20th century buildings, whose sole purpose throughout their history has been the betterment of the human condition. ",,"Staten Island, NYC, NY",Mayan Revival,

Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital was built in 1931 in the Italian Renaissance style (the term “Bellevue” would soon become slang for any mental health facility). This was a separate building from the general hospital at Bellvue. Over the years, it became a dumping ground by the police for many of the city’s so-called criminally insane (Mark David Chapman spent some time here – other well known patients include Edie Sedgwick and Norman Mailer). It also served as a revolving door for homeless patients, and by 1983, nearly all new admissions were re-admissions.
The city began phasing it out as a psychiatric center in 1984, and in 1998, it had been fully transformed into a homeless intake shelter. It almost became a luxury hotel in 2010, until plans fell through.
Currently Bellevue Hospital adult inpatient psychiatric services are comprised of 220 beds distributed among seven general units for patients ages 18 and older. A full range of in-patient psychiatric treatment is provided, including particular attention to those with psychotic, affective, and other major psychiatric illness, often with co-occurring substance abuse.

New York,Blackwell's Island Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Blackwell%27s_Island_Asylum,1834,1836,1839,Demolished,Pre-1854 Plans,Alexander Jackson Davis,Welfare Island,"The Blackwell's island Asylum was the first lunatic asylum for the city of New York and the first municipal mental hospital in the country. The institution was the first in what later became a larger system of New York City Asylums which was comprised of hospitals on Blackwell's, Ward's, and more briefly Hart's and Randall's Islands in New York City.
The Blackwell's Island Asylum was part of a larger complex of city buildings on the island, including at one point or another a Prison.
By the early 1800's New York City had become the largest urban area in the United States, a population heavily bolstered by immigration and industrialization. As a result there were large numbers of indigent insane, whose care fell to the city. In the years leading up to 1825 the city's insane were either kept in the city almshouse or at the Bloomingdale Asylum. It was in the year 1825 that the insane of the city were moved to the basement and first floor of a building built as a General Hospital on Blackwell's Island, part of a larger complex of municipal institutions on the island comprising of an almshouse and prison. It was here where the mentally ill remained in conditions described by the very commissioners in charge of the hospital as ""a miserable refuge for their trial, undeserving of the name Asylum, in these enlightened days"". It was not until 14 years later, in 1834, that the city approved the construction of a separate institution for the insane on the island as a result of long communications from Dr. James McDonald. However the hospital was not completed until 1839.
This new institution, located on the northernmost end of the island, was at this time completely separated from the other institutions on the island and given autonomy. Despite this new autonomy and purpose built hospital the conditions at the hospital quickly degraded and for the duration of its existence the hospital was plagued by overcrowding, under-funding, and scandals. In 1840 only one year after opening the population stood at 278, while by 1870, with no significant improvement in housing or infrastructure, the hospital housed 1,300, far more than any state hospital at the time. This overcrowding served to greatly hinder not only living conditions at the hospital but also impeded efficient internal administration. The inability to properly administer a facility of this size was made apparent by the substandard diet of the patients, frequent outbreaks of disease, and even the employment of convicts from the Blackwell's Island Prison as attendants to reduce costs.
This large patient population was a result of the hospital's general use to provide cheap custodial care to insane immigrants, with a population of 534 immigrant patients compared to only 121 native born patients in 1850. When considering the population of New York City at the time was less than half immigrant the true disproportion of this statistic is made apparent. The superintendent during the 1850's recognizing this appealed to the state for financial aid, citing both the extreme burden placed on the city by having to care for non-resident insane and the fact citizens of New York City were forced to pay taxes to support the State Asylum at Utica, which provided them no aid. His suggestions that the state either open an asylum in the city or take on the responsibility of immigrant insane fell on deaf ears and the population of the hospital continued to grow, by 1868 the hospital had accommodations for 640, but faced a population of 1035, necessitating the creation of a new city asylum on Wards Island in 1871.
The hospital was visited in the 1840s by both Thomas Story Kirkbride and Charles Dickens, neither of whom were impressed by conditions inside the hospital. After his visit Dickens wrote ""...everything had a lounging, listless, madhouse air, which was very painful. The moping idiot, cowering down with long disheveled hair; the gibbering maniac, with his hideous laugh and pointed finger; the vacant eye, the fierce wild face, the gloomy picking of the hands and lips, and munching of the nails: there they were all, without disguise, in naked ugliness and horror."" In 1858 there was also fire which destroyed part of the asylum, though it was swiftly rebuilt.
By of 1866 the hospital had grown to several buildings, three of which held patients. These were the Asylum, in the original building, the Lodge or ""Mad-house"", and the Retreat. The Asylum was housed in the original 1836 structure, consisting for two wings meeting at a right angle, joined in the center by an octagonal tower. Each wing consisted of three stories and an attic. The three primary stories housed patient rooms on either side while the attic housed the sick rooms. One wing housed men and the other women. The central octagon was used for physician's apartments, offices, and parlors. This building was partially modeled after the Hanwell Asylum in England.
The Retreat was a three story workshop building formerly used by the workhouse but was used by the Asylum to house female patients who outnumbered male patients. In the lodge there were four halls dedicated to females while only two were for males. The Lodge was where the more violent and newly admitted patients were housed. The new patients were kept here until their disposition could be positively identified. Those considered non-violent were moved to either the Asylum or the Retreat.
Other buildings as of 1866 included the Cook-house, where patient meals were prepared. Also in the cook house were the laundry facilities and the engine room which provided steam heat to the hospital. There was also a stable, blacksmith shop, carpenter's shop, a paint shop, and a dead house. 15-20 Acres under control of the asylum were used for the patient's benefit, either in the form of recreational ground or as farm land for their food. Four one story wooden pavilion buildings were also completed by 1868 and used to accommodate 70 female patients each.
One of the most famous cases associated with the hospital was the journalism of young female reporter Nellie Bly, who in 1887 entered the hospital under the guise of insanity under assignment from Joseph Pulitzer. She wrote, ""From the moment I entered the insane ward on the Island, I made no attempt to keep up the assumed role of insanity. I talked and acted just as I do in ordinary life. Yet strange to say, the more sanely I talked and acted, the crazier I was thought to be by all...."" Now trapped, Bly was tormented with rotted food, cruel attendants, and cramped and diseased conditions. After talking with other patients she became convinced many were as sane as she was, writing
""What, excepting torture, would produce insanity quicker than this treatment? Here is a class of women sent to be cured. I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see how long it will take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck."" 

She was held in the Asylum for ten days before she was finally released with the help of Pulitzer.
Her report, later published in the book Ten Days in a Mad-House, resulted in not only embarrassment for the Institution but a grand jury investigation into the conditions and the question of how so many ""professionals"" had been fooled. The end result was a $1,000,000 increase in the budget of the Department of Public Charities and Corrections as well as their recommendation of changes proposed by Nellie. Ultimately, this report brought about the end of the Asylum Blackwell's Island.
When the hospital on Ward's Island was completed on December 12, 1871 with accommodations for 500, all male patients from Blackwell's Island were transferred there. Despite this transfer of 400 patients the overcrowding at Blackwell's was so extreme 400 patients still slept on the floor nightly. In 1880 a new branch of the hospital was opened in old buildings on Hart Island and by 1886 construction of new buildings had begun at Central Islip, Long Island. By 1892 the New York City Hospital consisted of four departments: The original on Blackwell's Island, a large complex on Ward's Island, Hart's Island, and the new facilities at Central Islip, with a total patient population of 7478.
In 1890 the Federal Government took control of the Emigration Department, and when the new Immigration Station on Ellis Island opened in 1892 the former emigration complex and hospital on Ward's island was left under control of The New York City Asylum. In 1894 the state took control of the NYC Asylum system under lease, with one of the stipulations being the closure of the Asylums on Hart's and Blackwell's Island within five years. This same year many patients from the Blackwell's Island Asylum were transferred to accommodations formerly belonging to the New York City Homeopathic Hospital on Ward's Island. Transfers continued to former Emigration Hospital buildings on Ward's Island as well as the new colony at Central Islip on long Island. In February of 1901 the final patients were transferred to the newly finished buildings at Central Islip, bringing an end to the Asylum on Blackwell's Island.
The Asylum building on Blackwell's was taken over by the Metropolitan Hospital, which modified the buildings for the needs of a medical hospital. The Metropolitan Hospital continued to operate there until 1955 when it moved to Manhattan, leaving the former Asylum abandoned.
Today all that remains of the former Blackwell's Island Asylum is the central octagon tower which made up the center of the original building. After the Metropolitan Hospital left in 1955 the hospital sat vacant and the wings were demolished leaving only the Octagon which was ravaged by fire and neglect. In 1972 it entered the national register of historic places. Luckily the building was restored when it was incorporated into a new apartment complex built on the ground of the former Hospital.

New York,Brooklyn Training School and Home for Young Girls,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brooklyn_Training_School_and_Home_for_Young_Girls,1889,,1889,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The Training School and Home for Girls was the brainchild of Mrs. Phebe Francina Hallock Maine, a Park Slope lady of means, a blue blood descendent of Mayflower stock. Her husband, Malcolm T. Maine, was the head of a prosperous cotton trading company, and a member of the Cotton Exchange. The family was active in Society, Mr. Maine being one of the founding members of the Carlton Club, and one of the oldest members of the Montauk Club. Mrs. Maine’s other interests included the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Science, where she was an active associate member.
Mrs. Maine gathered up some of her friends, and they set about doing something for young women. They rented a house on Schermerhorn Street and in 1889, opened the Training School for Girls. The goal was to both give shelter, and train these young women for jobs in service and housekeeping; giving them a chance for gainful and honest employment. They soon had to rent the house next door, as well. A year later, they had moved yet again, this time to 80 Livingston Street.
The girls were able to dress individually, not in uniforms. No corporal punishment was allowed, and the grounds had room for gardens, lawn games and leisure. By 1893, the School had moved to 14th Street, to larger facilities. There, a weekly club was instituted where music and other entertainment was presented, and after a girl left the School, and went out on her own, she was encouraged to return at any time, and would be welcome to share her experiences with the other girls. They were also encouraged to attend church services, and the school was guided in their operation by many of the goals and principals of the YWCA, which was also charting new ground in women’s social issues.
By 1901, Phebe Maine was no longer in the picture. She was no longer listed on the board, and perhaps retired, or was in ill health. Both she and her husband died in 1907. By 1901, the school had moved around several times, always needing more room, and that year it came to its final resting place: a wood framed house in the newly fashionable St. Marks District, at 1483 Pacific Street, between Brooklyn and Kingston Avenues.
The magistrates and justices of Brooklyn’s court system began looking at the Training School as a girls’ reformatory, and began committing girls there, as far back as 1890. The first girl mentioned in the Brooklyn Eagle was a twelve year old named Josie Springer. By 1915, the Training Home was far too small for the rambling series of wood framed houses it occupied on Pacific Street. The city was on the verge of condemning the property, and a series of fund raisers was held to build a new facility. In 1919, a new, Mission style complex was built, taking up three or four lots on this quiet street.
In 1947, an article in the New York Times listed the Brooklyn Training School as one of the institutions the city would be using in its revamped court system for juvenile delinquents and “emotionally maladjusted pupils in need of rudimentary disciplinary attention.” For the first time, the courts were placing these truant and hard to control students in the hands of a school administrator, not a corrections administrator. It was thought that this would be a more effective way to deal with truancy and other problems before they became criminal problems. It was hoped that positive action in these institutions, of which the Training School was the only facility for girls, would result in helping less fortunate children develop into productive adults.
If that was to be the case, the city didn’t give the program much time at the Brooklyn Training School. In 1949, the school closed. In 2009, the site was chosen for a new charter school, and today, the Uncommon Charter High School welcomes a new generation through its doors. [1]",1949,"Brooklyn, NYC",,

New York,Hart Island,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hart_Island_Asylum,1869,,,,,,Hart Island Women's Asylum | Hart Island Workhouse | Phoenix House | Potter's Field,"Hart Island was purchased by the City in 1868 from the Hunter family of the Bronx for $75,000. The following year it was established as the City's public cemetery for the burial of those persons who died indigent or whose bodies went unclaimed. In the first year, 1,875 burials were performed.
In 1865, as the Civil War was ending, the Federal government used the Island as a prison camp for Confederate soldiers. During a yellow fever epidemic in 1870, a part of the Island was used to house persons confined to isolation. In the later part of the 19th century the Island was home to a charity hospital for women, an insane asylum, and a jail for prisoners who worked on the Potter's Field burial detail.
In the early 1900s, the Island housed an old men's home and a tuberculosis hospital for women. In 1904, a reformatory for male misdemeanants 16 - 30 years old was opened. When reformatory prisoners were transferred to another facility in 1914, the jail was used to house aged male prisoners and overflow from other City jails.
During WWII, the Island was turned over to the Navy for use as a disciplinary barracks for Navy, Coast Guard and Marine personnel, with as many as 2,800 servicemen in custody. In fact, probably the closest WWII ever got to the shores of America came when three German soldiers surfaced in a U-Boat near Long Island. They were taken into custody and imprisoned for a time on Hart Island.
Hart Island was returned to the Correction Department in 1946 and the jail was reactivated. In the 1940s, inmates on Hart Island appealed to the warden and offered to build a monument to the unbefriended dead. This was accomplished in 1948 when, in cooperation with the custodial staff, they erected a 30-foot high monument in the center of the burial site. On one side is engraved a simple cross; on the other the word ""Peace.""
In 1950, the Island was released to the Department of Welfare for housing of male derelicts. Because of a rising prisoner population, the Island was again returned to the Correction Department in 1954 for use as a jail. From 1955 to 1961, the U.S. Army maintained a NIKE missile base on a ten-acre area of the Island.
In 1966, the jail was closed and the Island was used as a center for the Phoenix House narcotic rehabilitation program. This program was discontinued in 1976 and the Island returned to the Correction Department. However, the Department did not operate the Island as a jail until 1982, when a small prisoner contingent was again housed there. In 1991, the inmates housed on Hart Island were transferred to Rikers Island.
Today, the inmate work details are bused from Rikers Island during the week to perform the burials, disinterments and maintenance of the Island. Since the start in 1869, more than 750,000 burials (estimate) have been performed.",,"New york, NY",,

New York,Manhattan Psychiatric Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ward%27s_Island_Asylum,1868,1869,13 December 1871,"Active, Demolished (Kirkbride and original buildings)","Kirkbride Plan (Original Building), Metropolitan Plan (Current Buildings)",Alexander Jackson Davis,Manhattan State Hospital  | Ward's Island Lunatic Asylum | Ward's Island Asylum | New York City Lunatic Asylum Ward's Island.,"Since 1839 the City of New York had been operating an asylum on Blackwell's Island for the care of the city's insane. At the time the vast majority of the insane under municipal care were poor immigrants, which at the time were pouring into New York City. As a result the population of the Blackwell's Island Asylum had steadily risen and was maintained in a perpetual state of overcrowding, providing only custodial care. To combat the rising population the asylum built a three story building for violent patients and later expanded to a three story building, formerly a workshop for the neighboring workhouse. Finally a series of one story pavilions were built however by 1868 the asylum only had accommodation for 640 of the 1035 patients under their care. The lack of room for expansion on Blackwell's Island, already hosting the city Asylum, Prison, Almshouses, and Workhouse, caused the city to look elsewhere. Nearby Ward's Island had been owned by the Department of Emmigration since 1847 and was already home to other city institutions. As a result a site was picked and the new branch of the asylum was established in 1868, opening to patient on December 12, 1871.
In 1871 when the new branch of the New York City Insane Asylum opened Ward's Island already was home to the Verplank State Emigrant Hospital, on the north eastern side, as well was the New York City Inebriate Asylum on the Southwestern part of the island, just below the new Insane Asylum. The new hospital building was built constructed of brick and Ohio free-state in the English Gothic Style with a Mansard roof. It was built in the Kirkbride style, with a three story central building with wings staggered back en echelon on either side. The cost of this structure was $700,000, and its overall frontage was 475 feet, with accommodation for 500 patients.
Upon opening the Ward's Island Asylum became the Male Department of the New York City Insane Asylum system, and it operated independently from the original Asylum, now the Female Department, on Blackwell's Island. Immediately all male patients were shipped up river to this new building. Regrettably this new hospital was no real improvement and suffered from many defects. The eating and lighting proved to be inadequate, the furniture was crude and many patients did not even have eating utensils to use at meal time. The nurse to patient ratio was one to 30 while the physicians proved inexperienced, only serving at the Asylum until they had enough experience to move on. Attendants proved similarly inadequate, as did treatment of patients, with many being locked in their rooms. The patients often were mingled with no regard to disease annd with no treatment. On top of this it was almost immediately the hospital found itself again overcrowded and looking for more space.
In 1875 the Wards Island Asylum transferred some patients to the former Inebriate Asylum, which had recently closed. However that same year the Ward's Island Homeopathic Hospital, which in 1894 would move to the Asylum buildings on Blackwell's island, took control of the building. In 1877 patients were sent to an unoccupied three story building, know as the ""annex"", formerly used by the Emigration Department to house immigrants. The building, having only open barracks style bays on each floor proved less than ideal for care of the insane. In 1880 some patients were transferred to the Hart Island Asylum, a new branch which moved into Civil War era barracks formerly occupied by an industrial school. Their age and nature made them completely unsuitable for habitation by the mentally ill but they were forced to endure the conditions for several years.
Finally in 1878 Superintendent MacDonald requested a new wing to the original building, providing room for an additional 250 patients. For the sake of time and expedience a second ward on the other wing was also set to be built. Immediately patients and convicts from the work house set to work on the new additions to alleviate the overcrowding. Also under MacDonald there was a marked improvement in hospital management, food, and general welfare. He worked to not only ensure a better diet for the patients but also replaced the sub standard and uncomfortable furniture and increased the funding for patient amusement. In 1879 four lectures on insanity were given at the hospital to the student physicians, with crowd ranging from 20 to over 200 at each. These were the first lectures of their kind given at a New York Insane Hospital. By 1880 Dr. MacDonald succeeded in finally getting rid of the practice of using convicts in hospitals, arguing it brought an atmosphere of crime and depravity which held the hospitals progress back. In this year manual restraints were also abolished at the hospital.
Despite the dedication and commitment of Superintendent MacDonald to improve and administer the hospital as well as possible the ever increasing population led ever worsening conditions. In 1886 allegations of poor food and attendants were made and an investigation found the claims credible. As a result appropriations were increased and plans made for construction of more buildings. Attendants buildings were built on Wards Island as well as Hart's and Blackwell's. Improvement's included a sea bath which was cut into the rock on the southern end of the island to allow the waters of Hell gate to flow into it. A plunge bath was also built in the West wing of the kirkbride. The hospital at this time included carpenters and painters shops, a shoe shop, brush shot, a tailor, a printing office, and others. All work was done by the patients, with a requirement for release from the hospital being proficiency in one of these trades, to better serve the patients search for employment. A new dietary was enacted and buildings were begun on a newly purchased 1000 acre tract of land at Central Islip on Long Island. This new Farm Colony would later become Central Islip State Hospital.
By 1892 the Ward's Island asylum had maintained its integrity as the male department of the hospital, holding 2,498 male patients, almost 300 over capacity. However, this same year considerations were made regarding the transfer of female patients to the recently abandoned State Emigrant Hospital complex, vacant since the new Federal Emigration Station at Ellis Island opened earlier in the year.
During this year with the 2,500 female patients at Blackwell's Island, and the roughly 100 on Hart's the city asylum cared for around 6,000 people.
In 1894 all properties of the city asylums on Hart's, Ward's, and Blackwell's Islands, were leased to the state of New York from the city. The agreement was that the state would have use of these leased properties for a period of 15 years, after which time control of the properties would be turned back over to the City of New York. During this time it was agreed upon that the state would provide for increased accommodation for patients and evacuate the institutions on Hart's and Blackwell's Island within five years, and evacuate the Ward's Island institution by the end of the 15 year term. This three Asylum Complex was now called ""Manhattan State Hospital"".
In this same year a majority of the female patients from the Blackwell's Island Asylum were transferred to former Emigrant Hospital buildings, and the building used by the New York City Homeopathic Hospital, which in turn moved into the former asylum buildings on Blackwell's. Transfers to Ward's Island continued and by 1898 only 839 patients remained on facilities on Blackwell's.
In 1899 all patients from Hart's Island were transferred either to Ward's Island or the new facilities at Central Islip. The Hart's Island Asylum was closed at this time.
By 1898 the Wards Island Asylum had a population of 2,031 male and 1,468 female patients, with most of the females coming from Blackwell's. The total population of the asylum by 1899 was 4,393, making it the largest institution in the world at the time.
By February 1901 with Hart's Island's closure two years prior and the transfer of the last of the patients on Blackwell's Island to Central Islip the Ward's Island Asylum, divided into two departments, East and West, was all that remained under State control. In 1905 these two departments were merged by the state into Manhattan State Hospital, while the colony at Central Islip, formerly a department of this hospital, was separated into an independent entity. In 1907 it was suggested the lease on the Ward's Island properties be extended and in 1908 a fifty year lease was signed between New York City and New York State, with the agreement that the state would erect new hospital facilities on a modern plan. The Hospital continued to grow, reaching its peak population of 7,000 in 1926.
In February 1923 a fire at the hospital claimed the lives of 25 patients.
In 1934 Robert Moses took over as head of the NYC parks department and tri-boro bridge authority. His goal was a long unrealized plan of a bridge linking Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, and Ward's and Randall's Island were vital to this plan. Furthermore he envisioned both Islands as a vast complex of parks and public space, even planning for a large stadium. While he did get his goal realized in many ways, with the House of Refuge and most other institutions being demolished in by 1937 he ran into problems when the Manhattan State Hospital refused to leave. Though still housed in 19th century buildings and a state law mandating its closure by 1943 it prevailed and continued to operate due to overcrowding at the other state institutions.
In 1954 voters approved a $350 million bond for construction of new buildings, which were built on the site of the former Emigrant Refuge and Hospital. Ths new complex consisted of 3 large metropolitan plan buildings, however new facilities did not end the hospitals troubles. The 1960's and 70's brought many problems. Rapes and robberies occured at the hands of criminals who came onto campus due to poor security and in 1974 the Times reported recently transferred retarded patients were left in rooms idly while equipment for their development went unused because of under staffing and poor management. Shortly afterwards the Mayor of NYC accused the hospital of being unsanitary, keeping poor records, and distributing drugs carelessly.
Also in the late 1970s the Mayor opened a ""temporary"" homeless shelter for 200 men, which was the cause of much debate and controversy. After turning it over to a private organization (Volunteers of America) it grew to 500 residents by 1981. By 1990, with accusations of the residents stealing, exposing themselves to children, and other criminal acts the VOA were forced to greatly increase the security at the Shelter. Today it provides a home to 600 men.
In 1979 the Manhattan State Hospital was re-consolidated into its current Manhattan Psychiatric Center. In 1985 one of the buildings was separated from the Manhattan State Hospital to become the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, for violent and criminally insane patients. Today it bills itself as a modern hospital providing top notch care to its patients. The in-patient population in 1995 stood at 900 patients and as of 2010 only 260 are housed in the hospital. The hospital also has 90 patients living in transitional housing on the campus as well as over 600 regular outpatients.

It opened in 1893 for women between the ages 15 and 30 who were convicted of petty larceny, habitual drunkenness, prostitution, or other misdemeanors. Albion's program included academic training to the sixth grade, vocational training, and religious training. It used a grading system to reward good behavior. Sentences were indeterminate and inmates could be held as long as five years. The institution operated under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Charities until 1926 when it was transferred to the new Department of Correction. In 1923, the name of the institution was changed to the Albion State Training School.
On July 1, 1931, the Albion State Training School (as there reformatory had been called since 1923) was re-designated the Institution for Mentally Defective Delinquent Women, a ""sister institution"" to Napanoch--the first such institution for women in the United States and probably in the world.
A month later, Dr. Gordon F. Willey became the first male to head the institution. On October 1, special trains began transporting Albion's ""normals"" down to Bedford Hills and bringing Bedford's defectives back on the return trip. In 1932, sensitive to stigmatizing, Albion reverted to the title of State Training School, but remained the state's institution for female defective delinquents.
Conditions in the 39-year-old institution were atrocious. The dorms were condemned as ""a fire hazard,"" the rooms had no heating and plumbing was a rarity. After a 1932 investigation declared that the reception building was an ""antique"" and ""a fire-trap of the most pronounced type,"" the Legislature allocated $1.5 million for reconstruction: three new brick dorms Each had a capacity of 120, were arranged around a quadrangle onto which faced a new administration building, school and other structures. (So collegiate did the rebuilt institution appeal that the superintendent received inquiries as to the entrance requirements.)
In 1957, the Western Reformatory for Women was also established at Albion. The reformatory used the same grounds and facilities as the Albion State Training School but they were managed as separate institutions. In 1967, a narcotic rehabilitation center also opened at Albion and was operated by the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission. In 1970, the reformatory was renamed the Western Correctional Facility and the training school renamed the Albion State Institution. In 1971, the entire facility became the Albion Correctional Facility. [1]",1971,"Albion, NY",,

Metzger,Craig Colony | Craig Colony School & Hospital | Craig State School | Groveland Correctional Facility (Current),"The Craig Colony for Epileptics was established in 1894 to meet the needs of New York’s indigent population who had epilepsy. The first patients were admitted in 1896. Craig Colony was constructed on over 1,900 acres using the “cottage plan,” a cluster of smaller buildings rather than one large structure. This institution also began to admit people with intellectual disabilities in 1935. Eventually known as Craig Developmental Center, it closed on December 6, 1988.
Craig Colony, named after Dr. Oscar Craig of Rochester, N.Y., was the second institution specifically for epileptics in the United States. At the time of the opening of Craig, it was believed that the inmates would be able to “sense” an oncoming seizure in the other patients, and would be able to prevent injuries due to falls. Craig, like the other institutions had a working farm, craft shops, school, and hospitals.
In 1968, the facility was phased out of existence as a specialized institution and became a facility for care, treatment, education, and training for people with intellectual and other developmental disabilities. In 1974, it was re-named a Developmental Center and operated under the authority of the New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities before closing in 1988.
The consecutive admission number was used to file the Patient's ""history"" in the record room. If a patient left the Craig Colony by discharge, elopement, or what have you, and subsequently returned to become a patient again, a new consecutive was assigned, and the older history was incorporated into the new history. There were some exceptions to this and there were (are) a number of patient records with two ""histories"" whose records were sent to central office in Albany when the the institution, now with the name Craig Developmental Center, O.M.R.D.D., closed its doors at Sonyea, NY. The entire collection of patient histories was archived in Albany. The roster of all patients ever admitted to Craig Colony, Craig Colony School, Craig Colony School & Hospital, Craig State School, and Craig Developmental Center was archived in Albany.

Located in Western New York, J.N. Adam Memorial Hospital was built on a sloping hilltop surrounded by 500 acres of forest. With the ""White Plague"" running ramped in Buffalo, the major J. N. Adam decided to build a hospital dedicated to the treatment of tuberculosis in 1909. The major paid for the land to build a hospital the with his own money, and commissioned the architect John Hopper Coxhead to design the buildings.
The campus was designed to allow the fresh air and sun to heal tuberculosis patients using Dr. Rollier’s Method of Heliotherapy. Modeled after southern plantations, the red-brick buildings had ornamental columns and wide verandahs on each floor to provide patients with fresh open air to sleep in. The buildings consisted of a Administration building, two patient wings and a dining hall rotunda with a stained glass dome taken from the 1901 Pan-American Exposition’s Temple of Music.
J. N. Adam was used as a tubercular hospital until 1960 and then was turned over to the State of New York for use as a developmental disability center. By 1995, the institutional treatment of such disabilities had ended and the complex was abandoned.[1]

New York,Letchworth Village,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Letchworth_Village,,1908,1911,Closed,Cottage Plan,Franklin B. Ware,Eastern New York State Custodial Asylum | Letchworth Village Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptics | Letchworth Village Developmental Center | Hudson Valley DDSO,"Built in 1911 for the ""feeble minded and epileptics,"" the Eastern New York State Custodial Asylum was eventually renamed to Letchworth Village Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptics after William Pryor Letchworth, a philanthropist. The facility was meant to be a departure from normal hospitals of the time and instead chose to symbolize a ""village"" structure. One story cottages dotted the landscape instead of a few massive hulking structures, due to the idea that a homelike institution and human contact would provide a better healing setting. These ideals caused much controversy at the time. Patients were separated by sex, and then separated again into three groups, never to mix contact: young and improvable, middle aged and industrious, and infirm and helpless. Education, training and vocational instruction were provided, and farm acreage was worked by the residents to raise food for the institution.
The institution was constantly plagued by overcrowding due to its revolutionary treatment ideals and popularity. Geraldo Rivera produced a segment on overcrowding of New York Institutions such as Willowbrook and Letchworth called ""The Last Great Disgrace,"" which eventually grew into a full length documentary on ABC. Rivera won a Peabody Award in 1971 for his work. As the population of the institution dwindled, residents were placed into group homes until the facility completely closed in 1996.
The farmland which once grew food for its residents and staff now has been sold and turned into country clubs and golf courses. The rest of the Letchworth buildings remain vacant, with the exception of one group of six, which are used as a daycare facility, and a couple of other buildings which were converted for school use and town administrative purposes.
Encore Haverstraw is now looking to redevelop the property into 550 single-family townhouses, an inn and restaurant, and retail stores. On December 6, 2006, Stewart Hall suffered from a very serious fire. The building was going to be reused in the condo development. Demolition of the remaining buildings is slated for sometime in 2007. A development proposal for the property known as Encore Haverstraw envisions 550 single-family townhouses, an inn and restaurant, and retail space.

New York,Long Island Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Long_Island_Developmental_Center,1962,,1965,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Suffolk State School,"In the summer of 1962 the state opened up the first bids for the center's construction. This bid included the power plants and the first building. By December of the same year, the second bidding process had begun and this included 50 buildings to go up on the site. That same month, the public was invited to a presentation in Smithtown in which the state presented its plans and functions for the new center. (Long-Islander, Dec. 6, 1962)
By mid-October 1965 the new Suffolk State School for the Mentally Retarded officially opened its doors and admitted its first 10 patients.  These children were transferred together from the Bronx State Hospital.  At this time, construction would not be completed for at least a year. The School estimated it would take five years to reach full capacity at 2,800 patients, with 1,100 staff, accepting a rate of 10 patients per week until staff was fully trained and they could accept more rapidly. (Long-Islander, Oct. 21, 1965)
The developmental center was a completely self-contained community with three commercial kitchens, a medical/surgical unit that housed x-ray equipment; a surgical suite; dental suites; a physiotherapy unit; clinics; laboratory; medical library and pharmacy as well as wards for postoperative cases and those who were acutely and/or chronically ill. LIDC, as it was fondly called by the individuals who lived there and the staff who cared for them, also had a fully operational power plant, sewage plant, maintenance and security services and a school building.
Controversy began when the living conditions of the patients at LIDC were being questioned. In August 1989 District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein ruled for the second time (first in 1984) that conditions need to be improved and populations reduced at the site. In 1986, the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities proposed ""the building of 40 to 50 small residential units to be built along the perimeter of the 500 acres of the Long Island Developmental Center for 600 clients now living in dormitories on the site… the units would be temporary homes, until the clients could be moved into the community in a 10-year period,"" according to the Feb. 8, 1987 Newsday.In 1990, in order to settle the lawsuit originally brought in 1978 by patients, the state agreed to move all its residents into small residential homes. (In 1992, they bought 40 homes and converted them for this use.)  But by the end of 1990, the state decided to close all of its developmental centers.
On March 31, 1993, in the face of this and another major lawsuit, as well as shifts in the state policy, the Long Island Development Center closed its doors. Following the closure of the LIDC in June, 1993, the Long Island DDSO became a total community-based service system, working in concert with approximately 75 voluntary agencies as well as consumers, families, governmental entities and other interested parties. The property has been re-developed & is now a golf course and housing for seniors.",1993,"Melville, NY",,

New York,Newark State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Newark_State_School,,1879,,Closed,Cottage Plan,Stephen Keener,Newark State School for Mental Defectives | State Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded Women,"The New York State Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded Women reflected a shift in belief that  almshouses (poorhouses) were improper places for ‘feeble-minded’ women. It was thought that feeble-minded women in almshouse settings acted promiscuously, and as a result frequently had illegitimate children who, then became dependent on the state for their welfare.  Women of child-bearing age, fifteen to forty-five, were admitted to the New York State Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded Women , in order to “prevent them from multiplying their kind and so increasing the number of the dependent classes on the State.""
While it was initially referred to as a school, before its name change, the asylum in Newark functioned to teach these women the necessary skills to be successful in the real world. Conditions were poor, as was the trend for those times. Despite advances in the treatment of the mentally ill, even in the 1800s, funding was lower than expenses, and not enough was known about mental health treatments for residents to get proper help. Many people found themselves living in Newark without any hope of release, regardless of whether they were demonstrating any symptoms of mental health problems.
In 1927, the name was changed back to the Newark State School, and in 1932, men were introduced to the population. It was during this time period when the school started becoming a self-sufficient campus, teaching its residents the skills allowing them to help maintain the grounds and run the school. Most of the buildings are now abandoned, although some of them are used by the Developmental Disabilities Services Office, and Finger Lakes Community College much like Mohawk Valley Community College uses the Old Oneida County Home buildings as part of its campus in Rome. While some institutions are moderately maintained, the unused buildings are in great disrepair, and are marked as condemned.

New York,Sampson State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sampson_State_School,,1942,1955,Closed,Single Building,,Sampson Naval Training Center | Sampson Naval College | Sampson Air Force Base | Willard State Hospital Sampson Annex  | Sampson State Park,"Sampson Army Airfield: The Air Force spent about $6 million on renovations and beginning mid Feb 1951 started traing what would be 16,000 Air Force recruits. The base employed about 700 civilians and had 600 permanent party troops. The Base was closed in June 1955. Starting in 1957 to 1960 the Air Field and some Officer Housing on the lake shore (449 acres) were transferred to the Seneca Army Depot, the hospital, now listed as 1,000-beds was transferred to Willard State Hospital (dated 9 Sep 1958 and filed 24 June 67), and 1265 acres of the Station were sold to NYS for park use 7 June 1960 (two parcels totaling 355 acres were auctioned to private individuals). One of the old rifle ranges is still used by the Town Police.
The Station was used by NYS for use as a temporary college for 15,000 GI Bill students in July 1946. (5 barracks were moved to Hobart in Geneva, 7 were moved to Syracuse University) Sampson College operated from September 1946 to June 1949 and had matriculated 7,500 students of which 950 received two-year degrees.
In March 1950 Sampson was proposed to be a State Park, but by October it was determined that the Air Force wanted it for training. The Center was transferred to the Air Force, for use as an indoctrination center similar to Lackland AFB in San Antonio. Willard vacated the hospital area.
The former hospital area was operated as a State School by Willard. In 1960 the State of New York purchased and assumed ownership of all tracts of land on the former base at a cost of $500,000. Most of the buildings were dismantled and materials were sold for re-usage throughout the Finger Lakes Region.In 1964 it housed 470 developmentally disabled male and female patients 16 years and older, and provided care for an additional 515 male mental patients. In 1971 the State closed the School due to budget cuts. While empty a fire destroyed most of the main hospital complex. Contaminated by asbestos the site was cleaned and is still owned by the Department of mental Hygiene but remains vacant.[1]

New York,Willowbrook State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Staten_Island_Developmental_Center,,1938,1947,Closed,Cottage Plan,William E. Hauugaard,Halloran General Hospital | Staten Island Developmental Center,"In 1938, plans were formulated to build a facility for mentally retarded children on a 375 acres (1.5 km²) site in the Willowbrook section of the Staten Island. Construction was completed in 1942, but instead of opening for its original purpose, it was converted into a United States Army hospital and named Halloran General Hospital, after the late Colonel Paul Stacey Halloran. After the war, proposals were introduced to turn the site over to the Veterans Administration, but in October, 1947 the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene opened its facility there as originally planned, and the institution was named Willowbrook State School.
Throughout the first decade of its operation, outbreaks of hepatitis were common at the school. This led to a highly controversial medical study being conducted there between 1963 and 1966, in which healthy children were intentionally injected with the virus that causes the disease. These studies were designed to gain an understanding of the natural history of infectious hepatitis and subsequently to test the effects of gamma globulin in preventing or combating the disease.
The subjects, all children, were deliberately infected with the hepatitis virus; early subjects were fed extracts of stools from infected individuals and later subjects received injections of more purified virus preparations. Investigators defended the deliberate injection of these children by pointing out that the vast majority of them acquired the infection anyway while at Willowbrook, and perhaps it would be better for them to be infected under carefully controlled research conditions.
During the course of these studies, Willowbrook closed its doors to new patients, claiming overcrowded conditions. However, the hepatitis program, because it occupied its own space at the institution, was able to continue to admit new patients. Thus, in some cases, parents found that they were unable to admit their child to Willowbrook unless they agreed to his or her participation in the studies. This case caused a public outcry forcing the study to be discontinued because of the perception that parents and their children were given little choice about whether or not to participate in research. In 1965, Senator Robert Kennedy paid an unannounced visit to Willowbrook. He found thousands of residents “living in filth and dirt, their clothing in rags, in rooms less comfortable and cheerful than the cages in which we put animals in a zoo.” Kennedy went on to describe the institution as a “snake pit.” The visit put conditions at Willowbrook into the national spotlight and the state of New York responded by developing a five-year improvement plan. However, after making minor adjustments, conditions at the institution quickly reverted to the inhumane conditions that had thrust it into public consciousness.
Through the several decades that Willowbrook was opened, there were continuous allegations of abuse reported on by the local paper, The Staten Island Advance. For many years, these allegations were dismissed and Willowbrook continued to uphold its well-respected reputation in the community. However by early 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then a reporter for television station WABC in New York, conducted a series of investigations at Willowbrook (on the heels of a previous series of articles in the Staten Island Advance and Staten Island Register newspapers), uncovering a host of deplorable conditions, including overcrowding, inadequate sanitary facilities, and physical abuse of residents by members of the school's staff. This resulted in a class-action lawsuit being filed against the State of New York in federal court on March 17, 1972. A settlement in the case was reached on May 5, 1975, mandating reforms at the site, but several years would elapse before all of the violations were corrected. The publicity generated by the case was a major contributing factor to the passage of a federal law, called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980.
In 1983, the State of New York announced plans to close Willowbrook, which had been renamed the Staten Island Developmental Center in 1974. By the end of March 1986, the number of residents housed there had dwindled to 250 (down from 5,000 at the height of the scandal exposed by Rivera), and the last children left the grounds on September 17, 1987. After the developmental center closed, the site became the focus of intense local debate about what should be done with the property. In 1989 a portion of the land was acquired by the City of New York, with the intent of using it to establish a new campus for the College of Staten Island. The new campus opened at Willowbrook in 1993 (at the same time, one of CSI's two other existing campuses, located in the island's Sunnyside neighborhood, was closed and that site became the home of a new high school). At 204 acres, this campus is the largest maintained by the City University of New York.
The remaining 171 acres of the state school's original property, at the south end, is still under the administration of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, which maintains a facility there called the Institute For Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities. At the Institution research is conducted on Down Syndrome, Autism, Alzheimer’s Disease and many rare diseases.

Woollett,Syracuse Developmental Center | New York State Asylum for Idiots | State Idiot Asylum | Syracuse State Institution for Feeble-Minded Children | Syracuse State School for Mental Defectives,"The New York State Asylum for Idiots was authorized by the New York State Legislature in 1851, acting upon a recommendation contained in the 1846 annual report of the New York State Asylum for Lunatics. Hervey B. Wilbur, M.D., was appointed the first superintendent and remained in that position until his death in 1883. First located on rented landed in Albany, it admitted its first ""pupils"" in 1851. The cornerstone was laid in 1854 for a new building in Syracuse, and the institution removed to Syracuse in 1855. After 1855 it was generally known as either the New York Asylum for Idiots or just the State Idiot Asylum, but in 1891 it was officially renamed the Syracuse State Institution for Feeble Minded Children, in 19-- the Syracuse State School for Mental Defectives, and finally in 19-- just the Syracuse State School. Wilbur collaborated with Edward Seguin, M.D., the originator of the physiological method of training. Maria Montessori was also Seguin's student and much of the ""Montessori Method"" is based on foundations laid by Wilbur and Seguin in Syracuse. In its 85th annual report (1935), the Syracuse State School rightly noted that it was ""the pioneer institution in the United States for the care and training of mentally deficient children."" Surgery was done in the old building, and at least one child was born there. The School also operated a farm and a number of satelite cottages. In the 1970s, the Syracuse State School building was torn down and replaced by a residential facility called the Syracuse Developmental Center. With the growing emphasis on community living rather insitutionalization for developmentally disabled persons, no new individuals were placed at SDC and there has been a gradual movement of residents into the community. In early 1998, there were about six persons left. SDC is to be closed, and it is not clear what will happen to the building. [1]
The colonies were limited in capacity to around 20 boys or girls and the school made every effort to make these colonies more home like with furnishings and surroundings.  To achieve this, the colonies were located within residential neighborhoods surrounding Syracuse.  Four girl colonies were located within the city limits while a boys colony was on a farm on the outskirts of Syracuse.  The colonies within the city did not differ from the homes surrounding them.  The girls were employed as domestics within residential homes and the boys were used as labor in local farms and other industries. The wages the boys and girls made went into paying a minimum  charges for room and board with the remaining wage placed in a personal account for the student.  These accounts were used to pay for personal clothing and other expenses the student occurs.  There was no time limit as far as how long a student would be at a colony.  It depended on how fast they matured and when the time was right, they could move out of the colony to live on their own.

New York,Wassaic State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wassaic_State_School,1926,1927,1931,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Wassaic State School for Mental Defectives |  Wassaic Developmental Center,"The Wassaic State School opened on Jan. 7, 1931 as one of five new statewide facilities established to house and work with individuals who suffered with developmental disabilities. The School operated on a complex in the Town of Amenia hamlet. Prior to the New York Department of Mental Hygiene’s acquisition of the property in 1926, it consisted of three separate farms. The operation was established to alleviate overcrowding at other facilities in New York City and Long Island. Within three years of acquiring the land 27 buildings were already nearing completion.
Among its first buildings were Barton, Carter and Amity halls, all standing two-stories tall and featuring an 11-bay Mission-style design. Ten of the buildings were earmarked for occupancy by 2,400 residents while another four were intended for employee housing; others served auxiliary departments and operations. Most of the buildings constructed in the initial phase were built along two large ovals that were separated by two dining halls and a hospital. In 1933, an administration building was added. Also standing two-stories, that structure boasted a Georgian Revival design and featured a façade that spanned nine bays. A three-story, 13-bay building, named Berkshire Hall, was erected simultaneously to the administration building, and its primary purpose was to provide classroom activities in sewing and arts and crafts for female residents. The large building was also fitted with a bowling alley and auditorium.
The overall layout of the campus was carefully designed according to a specific resident’s treatment, as well as the severity level and demeanor of the individuals involved. Male and female sections were located at opposite ends of the campus and separate infirmaries served each group. It didn’t take long for the state-run facility to reach its capacity. As was experienced at other facilities of its kind, resident escapes occurred occasionally and state and local law enforcement got involved when the runaways engaged in unlawful action.
In the mid-1940s, additional security measures, including the installation of window guards and a new wall, were introduced in an attempt to deal with patients who were considered a high risk for flight. Still, overcrowding plagued many of the state-operated sites and by the 1950s, Wassaic State School reached its peak, housing up to 5,000 patients. In 1965, the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island stimulated scandalous newspaper headlines when an investigation found that it exceeded its capacity by about 2,000 residents, and those living there did so in filth and clad in dirty clothing. The scandal, which was broadcast nationwide, caused state officials to closely examine all the facilities.
The Wassaic operation subsequently went through two name changes through the years, first to the Wassaic Developmental Center and later to the Taconic Developmental Disabilities Service Office (DDSO). The facility closed in late 2013 in order to integrate individuals with developmental disabilities into the community. While residents are now gone from the facility, a support staff still works at the developmental disabilities service office building, located in the center of the complex.

However by early 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then a reporter for television station WABC in New York, conducted a series of investigations at Willowbrook (on the heels of a previous series of articles in the Staten Island Advance and Staten Island Register newspapers), uncovering a host of deplorable conditions, including overcrowding, inadequate sanitary facilities, and physical abuse of residents by members of the school's staff. This resulted in a class-action lawsuit being filed against the State of New York in federal court on March 17, 1972. A settlement in the case was reached on May 5, 1975, mandating reforms at the site, but several years would elapse before all of the violations were corrected. The publicity generated by the case was a major contributing factor to the passage of a federal law, called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980.
In 1983, the State of New York announced plans to close Willowbrook, which had been renamed the Staten Island Developmental Center in 1974. By the end of March 1986, the number of residents housed there had dwindled to 250 (down from 5,000 at the height of the scandal exposed by Rivera), and the last children left the grounds on September 17, 1987. After the developmental center closed, the site became the focus of intense local debate about what should be done with the property. In 1989 a portion of the land was acquired by the City of New York, with the intent of using it to establish a new campus for the College of Staten Island. The new campus opened at Willowbrook in 1993 (at the same time, one of CSI's two other existing campuses, located in the island's Sunnyside neighborhood, was closed and that site became the home of a new high school). At 204 acres, this campus is the largest maintained by the City University of New York.
The remaining 171 acres of the state school's original property, at the south end, is still under the administration of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, which maintains a facility there called the Institute For Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities. At the Institution research is conducted on Down Syndrome, Autism, Alzheimer’s Disease and many rare diseases.

New York,Albany Hospital for Incurables,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Albany_Hospital_for_Incurables,,1845,1902,Preserved,Single Building,,William Walsh House | Reilly House (Current),"When the house was built, in 1845, it was south of Albany's city limits, in the Town of Bethlehem. William Walsh and his wife were part of the city's wealthy aristocracy. The house was purchased in 1902 by Eleanor Spensley, who had founded the Hospital for Incurables in downtown Albany 20 years earlier. She died two months later. For hospital purposes the roof was raised and dormer windows added.
In that form, the Hospital for Incurables continued operating in the house until 1973. After it was closed the two rear wings were demolished. It remained vacant, owned by the hospital, until sometime after it was listed on the Register in 1974 when the Addictions Care Center of Albany acquired the property. The roof was completely replaced with a flat roof and modern sliding windows were installed. It is now the Reilly House, a sober living environment that can hold up to 12 men at a time.
Addendum: The main house was demolished by the Albany Citizens Council on Alcoholism as it was non-salvagable. The ACCA maintained the back unit  home, which was originally nurses residences for those employed at the hospital. This was concerted into a man's halfway residence for addiction and recovery. Another building, originally used for storage of maintenance eguipment, housed self help meetings. In the late 90's both buildings were demolished and a new facilty, housing the residential facility, outpatient services and administrative offices, was built. It openened sometime in the early 200's and still operates today.  NMcGahay",1973,,,
New York,Bloomingdale Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bloomingdale_Asylum,1816,,1821/1894 (Second location),Active,Kirkbride Plan,James Brown Lord,Society of the New York Hospital | White Plains Asylum | Payne Whitney Westchester | Payne Whitney Clinic | Cornell Medical Center | Weill Cornell Department of Psychiatry,"Psychiatric services delivered in general hospitals may appear to be a 20th-century innovation, but the practice began in 1752, when the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia provided for mental patients. In New York City, the New York Hospital, which received a royal charter in 1771, also admitted mental patients when it opened in 1792. Curable patients were preferred, and public patients, whose care was paid for by their townships, were admitted along with private patients.
The demand for admission led to construction of an adjacent building in 1808 known as the New York Lunatic Asylum. The state legislature provided an annuity to the hospital (1816-1849) to help defray the costs for public patients. (The first state mental hospital in New York opened in 1843 in Utica.)
Thomas Eddy, a Quaker member of the hospital Board of Governors of New York Hospital, had corresponded with Samuel Tuke of the Quaker York Retreat in England, where a new approach to treating mentally ill people, known as moral treatment, had been instituted. It consisted of kindly treatment, occupational and recreational activities, minimal or no restraint, and medication as needed. Eddy successfully pressed the Board of Governors to use the moral treatment approach at the New York Lunatic Asylum.
In 1816 the need for a larger asylum led to the purchase of land around 120th Street, and in 1821 the Bloomingdale Asylum was opened. Administration of the asylum was under a lay superintendent or warden, and visiting physicians provided medical services. The Asylum and Inspection committees of the Board of Governors provided supervision.
In 1825 James McDonald, M.D., was appointed “resident physician” and in 1831 was sent to study mental hospitals in Europe. McDonald was dissatisfied with his limited authority and urged the Board of Governors to give the resident physician more authority over patient treatment. Gradually this was accomplished, and after mid-century the resident physician became superintendent, while a warden oversaw tasks not related to patient care.
The asylum had been named Bloomingdale after the main road alongside the property, and this name maintained until well into the 20th century.
The press for admission continued as the city's population increased, and in 1868 the Board of Governors bought farm land north of the city in White Plains, Westchester County. In 1894 a large hospital was opened with the name of Society of the New York Hospital, Bloomingdale, White Plains. In the early 1900s Payne Whitney, a member of the Board of Governors, left a fund to New York Hospital for “neurologic and psychiatric work.” To provide these services, a building known as the Payne Whitney Clinic was constructed at the New York Hospital site. In 1936 the name Bloomingdale disappeared, and the psychiatric hospital is now named Payne Whitney Westchester. [1]

New York,Brigham Hall,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brigham_Hall,,,1855,Preserved,Single Building,,Brigham Hall Private Asylum,"After purchasing the 67 acres of woodland and open fertile fields with a partially finished mansion for $10,000 from the Eunice Clark family estate, Dr. Cook with the assistance of Robert Cook, Dr. John B. Chapin and Willard G. Wayne founded and opened Brigham Hall on Oct. 3, 1855. The complex — later expanded in 1860 to 100 acres — encompassed what is today almost all of the land bounded by South Pearl, Parrish, West and Bristol streets. The extensive grounds of Brigham Hall had a beautiful view of Canandaigua Lake and possessed many wildflowers, much wildlife and native trees. Dr. Cook often referred to the grounds as ""the grove.""
Dr. Cook named Brigham Hall after Dr. Amariah Brigham, the first superintendent of the State Asylum for the Insane in Utica. Dr. Brigham was at the time the most highly regarded doctor in the field of mental health and was held in world-wide esteem in the field of psychiatry. Before coming to Canandaigua, Dr. Cook had been an assistant physician under Dr. Brigham, who significantly influenced him in developing his humanistic approach to the treatment of the insane. Interestingly, Dr. Cook earned his M.D. degree from the Geneva Medical College in 1846, a former branch of today’s Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
When Brigham Hall opened in 1855, it was housed in the Clark family mansion, which was partially complete when the site was purchased. It was rapidly completed and was able to accommodate a dozen or so patients. Soon after opening, plans were made to make an expansion to the north side of the mansion. The two-story north wing opened in November 1856 with the first floor appropriated to the male patients and the second floor to the female patients. An additional expansion was made to the south side of the mansion (now the main administrative building) by 1860 that housed the female patients. The north-side expansion would now house the male patients. Additional structures were added to the Brigham Hall site between 1860 and 1876, including a large chapel, a recreation room, reading room, workshops, billiard hall, bowling alley and a large barn. The last major expansion on the site was the construction of the George Cook Building in 1936.
In addition to the need to expand the Brigham Hall facility, Dr. Cook and Dr. Chapin realized the importance of receiving a charter from the New York State Legislature incorporating the facility for the reception and care of the insane. Such a charter was prepared and passed by the Legislature in 1859. It is noteworthy that under this charter the use of the word ""Hospital"" was used for the first time by the State of New York to describe the medical character of an institution for the care and treatment of the insane. Previously, institutions of the insane were referred to as asylums or alm houses, which focused on their detention and incarceration. Brigham Hall Hospital was also one of only two private facilities in the state at that time. Public facilities at that time were quite limited, and most patients were held in county facilities.
From 1855 to 1961, Brigham Hall Hospital was administered by ten resident physicians in charge of the hospital. After Dr. George Cook died in 1876, Dr. Harvey Jewett was hired as an interim physician but did not live in Brigham Hall. In 1876, Dr. Dwight Burrell became resident physician until 1908 when Dr. Robert G. Cook [son of Dr. George Cook] was appointed. Dr. Robert G. Cook served until his retirement in 1929. Dr. Henry Burgess was hired in 1929 and served until his death in 1933. Dr. Robert Ross and later his wife Dr. Margaret Ross served the hospital until 1951. Dr. Francis Kelly assumed the position of resident physician until his resignation in 1956. Dr. Roy Van Allen was appointed in 1956 but died unexpectedly in 1957. The last resident physician was Dr. Howard Berg, who served until Brigham Hall was closed in 1961.
In addition to the efforts of these resident physicians, they were many more nurses, attendants, resident staff and members of the Board of Managers who oversaw the care and treatment of the patients of Brigham Hall. The range of services provided by the hospital included psychotherapy, treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, and electrotherapy as needed.
The common philosophy that was at the center of this hospital was the humanistic treatment of every patient. This treatment included providing settings for occupational therapy, permitting entertainment and artistic activities for the release of creative talents, offering individual attention to each patient’s needs, and furnishing an environment that promoted comfort and care. Brigham Hall provided private bedrooms; diversions including billiards, cards, games, books, music, and dancing; opportunities to perform light work about the grounds; and craft shops for both men and women. At any one time, Brigham Hall had between 65 and 80 patients.
In 1960, one of the hospital wings was converted to a nursing home as the number of mental patients applying to Brigham Hall was declining. The main reasons for this decline in private facilities like Brigham Hall were the changes in the treatment of mental patients with new drugs that allowed many people to remain in their homes, the increasing trend of housing mental patients in public facilities, and the rising costs of private care.
In 1961, Brigham Hall Hospital and its grounds were sold to Howard Samuels for $250,000. The nursing care facility known as the Grove Home continued to operate until 1979. However, the psychiatric care of Brigham Hall had come to an end. In 1967, Howard Samuels proposed converting the rest of the complex into a youth correctional institution, which was met with a great deal of community opposition. John and Noreen Black, who had partnered with Samuels in operating the Grove Home, ultimately bought it. They closed the Grove Home, mainly due to the rising costs of nursing homes that were the result of increased state regulations. In 1979, the Blacks converted the main buildings into the Brigham Hall Condominiums.
Today, the grounds of the old Brigham Hall are home to the condominiums and the Heritage House apartments as well as several single family homes. Brigham Hall is gone but it is not forgotten. [1]",1960 (As a psychiatric facility),"Canandaigua, NY",Gothic,
New York,Brunswick Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brunswick_Home,,,1887,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,"Brunkswick Hospital & Sanitarium, Private Asylum for the Feeble-Minded | Brunswick Hall Psychiatric Hospital | Brunswick Hospital Center","Founded in 1887 by Stephen R. Williams, who served as Suffolk Co. Superintendent of Poor from 1872-1880, the Brunswick Home was a privately-run home for disabled children and adults. The establishment was described as a handsome edifice, 250 ft. in length, containing a central building four stories high, surmounted by a cupola, and 75-ft. wings on either side. A historic photograph from the era corroborates the architectural description. A drawing in the collection of the Easthampton Library also depicts the addition of a hospital unit ca. 1930, which was part of a new construction program to make the Brunswick Home the largest private sanitarium and hospital within Long Island territory.
In 1931 the Home became the Brunswick Hospital Center, which in addition to its general hospital functions, provided three other distinct divisions of care: nursing home, rehabilitation, psychiatric facility, as well as other community services.  The larger of two remaining private hospitals recorded by Long Island Business News in 2003, it boasted a 31-acre campus and its four divisions of care an aggregate 475-bed facility overall. The Center’s mission was dedicated to providing comprehensive, efficient and effective patient care within its established parameters. The hospital closed in 2005 and the building was demolished in 2012. Only the psychiatric division, Brunswick Hall Psychiatric Hospital, remains in operation today.
Four charred bodies were found today in ruins of the Brunswick Home Hospital, destroyed by fire yesterday. One body was recovered yesterday and a sixth is being sought. Three of the bodies found today were identified as ABRAHAM NICHELSON, 62, Manhattan; MRS. ADELAIDE RAYNOR, 80, Freeport; and MRS. VINCENZIA BOTTICELLI, 64, of East Hempstead. The fourth body was tentatively identified as that of ISABELLE PAWSON, 52, Rockville Center.

New York,Graham Highland Park Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Graham_Highland_Park_Sanatorium,,,1900,Preserved,Single Building,,Graham Highland Park Sanatorium and Maternity Hospital,"In the spring of 1900, Dr. Merritt E. Graham, a former Monroe County Coroner and the chief surgeon at the Hahnemann Hospital (the homeopathic precursor to Highland Hospital), opened an eponymous sanatorium, which boasted the latest in modern medical equipment and an envious hillside setting on South Avenue. Merritt Graham ran his pastoral practice for five years until his untimely death in August 1905. Following Merrit’s passing, his son Dr. Corden T. Graham took over the institution. By the close of October that year, the sanatorium had put on an addition, and rebranded itself as the Graham Highland Park Sanatorium and Maternity Hospital.
In addition to TB patients and expecting mothers, the sanatorium also admitted individuals who suffered from “nervous ailments” and various mental illnesses. At the time, it was maintained by many in the medical community that these conditions, like physical illnesses, could often be treated by a prolonged period of rest in a healthful environment. While this method of treatment was seemingly successful for a number of Graham’s patients, others only found escape from their troubles by escaping the hospital itself and taking matters into their own hands. One such incident almost led to the Highland Park Sanatorium’s demise. In November 1907, a well-respected professor from West High School named Fred Abell fled the sanatorium via a fire escape two weeks after his family had brought him to the facility. The next day, Abell’s body was found near the reservoir in Highland Park, where he had died due to exposure.
Abell’s death led the State Lunacy Commission to launch an inquest into Dr. Corden T. Graham and his institution. Their main charge was that Graham had no right to treat mentally ill patients since he didn’t have a license to admit them to his hospital. Graham defended his actions by indicating that his sanatorium only accepted patients that suffered from mild forms of mental illness, such as melancholia, and that other hospitals in the city also engaged in this practice. The doctor was indicted by a Grand Jury in 1908, but the indictment was later dismissed when the case was brought before a county judge. Judge Stephens contended that hospitals such as the Graham Highland Park Sanatorium allowed individuals suffering from mild mental illness to get treated without having to undergo a State-ordered commitment to an asylum. Moreover, patients could be temporarily admitted to institutions such as Graham’s and then reintegrate into society without suffering any of the stigma associated with having been committed (which was then a matter of public record).
Dr. Graham continued to run the Highland Park Sanatorium for almost a decade following the court case. After selling the hospital in 1917, he went on to become the surgical director of Base 19 Hospital in France during WWI and a Lieutenant-Colonel in the US Army Reserve. The hospital he left behind was converted into the apartment complex that remains perched atop the corner of South Avenue and Alpine Street today.",1917,"Rochester, NY",,

The patients were treated like guests arriving at one of the many local waterfront resorts similar to the Surf Hotel being built during the Gilded Age (1870-1900)
The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Aug. 15, 1884, ran an advertisement for the Long Island Home Hotel stating “it was a private hotel…for the care of persons afflicted with mental and nervous derangements. Near the Great South Bay and Ocean; 32 miles from New York.” The advertisement was signed by John Louden, and placed above that of the Argyle Hotel, a resort in Babylon. Two years later on June 5, the South Side Signal (Babylon) reported that Cornelius Richardson, a Brooklyn man, was transferred to the Amityville Insane Asylum. Perhaps the patients were beginning to understand that it was not a hotel.
By Sept. 30, 1886, 17 patients died at the Long Island Home Hotel, and 99 remained. The commission’s report mentioned, “…that the managers, individually and as a board, have been somewhat remiss in the discharge of their duties.” Further details were not given. The new superintendent of the Long Island Home Hotel was Joseph Carpenter, and the institution consists of a central building with a male, and a separate female two-story wing. The facility was two stories with a central hall, and dormitories on each side. Each floor had a day room and closets, as well as in the central building were parlors and private rooms.
Between October 1887 and September 1888, the institution had 20 deaths, 147 persons admitted with 80 being male and 67 female. The month of January had the most patients, and for the year 113 were discharged. The commissioner’s report mentioned that since the last report the name of the institution had changed slightly from the Long Island Homes Hotel to the Long Island Homes Company. A detailed description of new construction was given, and it was stated that “the servant’s quarters have been removed out of the main building, which had been a great source of annoyance.”
Around 1900, another Long Island Home cottage was built named Stanton Cottage (later the Sage House) for the treatment of just one patient.The following year, Maurice Barrymore (born Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blythe in 1849), the actor, would arrive at the Long Island Home for the Insane. In 1912, the Long Island Home purchased more property near the main building, which included a large home, two barns and several outbuildings.
The Long Island Home became the South Oaks Hospital in the 1950s. During these years, recognizing a community need, the board of directors convert Searle Cottage into a nursing home. Searle Cottage is renamed Broadlawn Manor Nursing Home.

The chain of mills used water power routed along a series of tunnels engineered by Marshall in the 1840s. These textile mills were among the earliest parts of the industrial development of Troy in the early 19th century. Marshall became a wealthy and prominent citizen of Troy in the mid-19th century until his death in 1858. Marshall founded the Marshall Infirmary as a hospital 1848 that included patients who were mentally ill. The Infirmary was incorporated in 1851 and in 1858 Marshall died and his will created a trust to help support the Infirmary.
The first building was built on his estate on Linden Avenue and during the Civil War and later years, additional wings and buildings were added to the Infirmary. During the Civil War, the Rensselaer County appropriated funding to pay the Infirmary to care for the county’s mentally ill patients. About 1900, the name was changed to Marshall Sanitarium. During the Depression years, the Sanitarium had financial difficulties, but survived and continued to operate as an asylum until 1964. The Board of Governors in that year considered the changes in medical care of the mentally ill and the expense of renovating their buildings and acquiring modern equipment. Because the Sanitarium could not afford to modernize their buildings and equipment, the governors decided to close the Sanitarium.",1964,"Troy, NY",,

New York,Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Payne_Whitney_Psychiatric_Clinic,1927,,1932,Demolished,Single Building,,,"On Oct. 1, 1932, the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center opened its doors. While psychiatric care had a venerable tradition at The New York Hospital dating back to the late eighteenth century, psychiatric services had been segregated from the general hospital since 1821, with the establishment of the Bloomingdale Asylum (now the Westchester Division). In 1899, 5 years after the Bloomingdale Asylum moved from Manhattan to White Plains, Samuel B. Lyon, medical superintendent, began to advocate for an institution based at the main hospital in New York City, so as to provide short-term treatment of acute mental illness.
Lyon also advocated for an academic affiliation so that this would be a ""new centre for investigating all the questions connected with the causes, treatment and care of the insane."" Lyon's vision would take three decades to become a reality. In 1927, Payne Whitney, a member of The New York Hospital Board of Governors, died, leaving a bequest to fund ""neurologic and psychiatric work."" One month later The New York Hospital formally associated with Cornell University Medical College. From these events, the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic and the Cornell University Medical College Department of Psychiatry would be born.
Designed in a neo-Gothic style, the 104-bed Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic featured elegant wood paneling, chandeliers, and upholstered furniture. Underground corridors connected the otherwise freestanding clinic to the main hospital. Patient units were categorized by level of acuity; hence, as a patient improved he or she would move through the different units until finally being discharged. If improvement was not imminent, patients were transferred to the Bloomingdale Asylum.
A former Bloomingdale physician, George S. Amsden, was appointed the first psychiatrist-in-chief (1932–1935). In 1936, a protégé of Adolph Meyer, Oskar Diethelm, succeeded Amsden and ran the clinic for the next 26 years. Diethelm was followed by William Lhamon (1962–1974), Robert Michels (1974–1991), William A. Frosch (1991–1993), and Jack D. Barchas, who has been psychiatrist-in-chief since 1993. Under their leadership the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic developed into one of the nation's leading academic psychiatric centers.
In 1993, the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic building was razed to make way for a new New York Hospital. In August 1997, the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic returned from temporary quarters to take up residence in the Greenberg Pavilion of The New York Hospital. Fully integrated into the hospital, the new Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic now opens its doors to the acutely mentally ill, much as Samuel Lyon envisioned nearly a century ago.",,"Manhattan, New York, NY",,

New York,Providence Retreat,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Providence_Retreat,1860,1860,1860,,Kirkbride Plan,,Providence Lunatic Asylum,"Description from 1912 -
“Providence Retreat,” of, as it was then known, “The Providence Lunatic Asylum,” the oldest institution for the care of the insane in Western New York, was built by the community known as “The Sisters of Charity” in the yea 1860 and occupied August 15 of the same year.
The incentive for building the institution was furnished by a visit paid by the foundress, Sister Rosaline Brown, to the County Hospital, where the insane were kept at that time, there being no state hospital nearer than Utica.  The conditions and surroundings filler her with compassion for the poor unfortunates, many of whom were restrained by means of chains, or tied to posts or stationary chairs; their clothing was scant, their food of the poorest.
Determined to erect a hospital for this particular class, she secured permission from her Superior, and being without funds, she begged and borrowed money from her friends, among whom she numbered many of Buffalo’s prominent citizens, the late ex-President Cleveland being among the benefactors.
Thirty acres of land were purchased and a portion of the building was erected thereon.  The struggle to maintain and properly care for the patients was a hard one; being out of the city, no gas or water could be obtained; candles served for light, and water had to be conveyed in barrels a distance of a mile every day or so.  The majority of the patients were county charges for a number of years.
Dr. William Ring of Buffalo was appointed physician-in-charge in 1862 and remained as such up to his death in 1887.
His successors were Dr. F. S. Crego and Dr. G. Ring, serving up to 1891, when Dr. Harry A. Wood became physician-in-charge.
Additions to the original building were made from time to time up to April, 1905, when a new building costing $45,000 was started.  This building was completed and occupied for the first time on November 7, 1907.
Dr. H. A. Wood resigned in May, 1902, and was succeeded by Dr. J.J. Twohey, who had been assistant since 1898.  Dr. Wm. C. Krauss was appointed medical superintendent and remained in that position up to his death in September, 1909.
No public patients are now treated at this institution.  Modern methods are pursued in the care of patients, and the institution is equipped with everything needful.
The “Providence Retreat,” as it is now known, is licensed by the State Hospital Commission for the care of private insane patients.
Besides these, there are treated yearly 600 alcoholic and drug cases; many voluntary patients, neurasthenics, border line cases are admitted, coming from every state  in the Union and from Canada.
Medical officers of Providence Retreat since its inception:
Dr. William Ring of Buffalo, N.Y., physician-in-charge from 1863 to 1887.
Dr. Floyd S. Crego and Dr. William G. Ring, physician-in-charge from 1887 to 1891.
Dr. Harry A. Wood, physician-in-charge from 1891 to 1902.

Built on land once known as the Wolcott Estate, the private sanitarium advertised itself as a place for people with “mental and nervous diseases” and alcohol and drug addiction. Dr. Kindred had some training in psychology, though it’s unclear how effective his sanitarium was. Old newspaper articles reference patients who were there for everything from cocaine addiction to “temporary mental aberration.” Articles also note several escapes, suicides, and people committed against their will.

Givens. Givens was educated at the Eclectic Medical Institute in Cincinnati, and after graduation interned at the State Homoeopathic Insane Hospital (Middletown, NY) and the Westboro Insane Hospital (MA). He eventually settled in Stamford and established a sanitarium to treat mental disorders and substance addictions, including alcohol, opium, chloral and cocaine habits. Treatment included private nurses, baths, massage, hydrotherapy, faradic, galvanic, and static electricity.
When the hospital first opened, it consisted of only two cottages, but it quickly grew to be the largest private sanitarium in New England. The patient population in 1896 was 75 and by 1906 it was 250.
Stamford Hall became so renowned for its treatments and beautiful campus that it attracted many well-to-do clientele. As noted in Givens’ 1919 obituary: “Some of the most distinguished statesmen, lawyers, judges, clergy, writers and bankers in America have been patients here. Were the list made public, it would cause astonishment, for often when the public assumed that certain well known people were traveling abroad, or spending vacations in some out-of-the-way resort, they were under treatment here.”
One notable patient was Draper Daugherty, the son of the Attorney General under President Harding. Daugherty first made headlines in 1923 as a suspect in the murder of Broadway actress and socialite Dorothy “Dot” King. King was found dead in her New York City apartment “chloroformed to death.” Thousand dollars’ worth of jewelry was missing as well. Daugherty was an admirer of King. Though he was nowhere near New York City when King’s body was discovered, because he was married and was suddenly admitted to Stamford Hall fueled rumors that he was hiding something. Later that year, Daugherty escaped from Stamford Hall during a daily walk. He was first admitted to the hospital for alcoholism and quickly gained a reputation for being a “troublesome patient” after multiple escape attempts. Daugherty was never brought back to the hospital and King’s murder remains unsolved.
Stamford Hall remained in operation until it was closed in 1965.",December 1965,"Stamford, CT",,

New York,Albany City and County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Albany_City_and_County_Poor_House,1824,,,,,,,"In 1824 the Albany City and County Poor House was established within the city of Albany.  It started out with four brick buildings and was connected to a farm of 216 acres that yielded an annual revenue estimated at $6,000.00.  The basement of one building were used for domestic purposes while the others were unoccupied.  In the poor house proper, were 10 rooms, warmed by furnaces and stoves, but with very little ventilation. Each room had six to forty paupers living within them.
The number of inmates was 319, 120 males and 299 females. [Note: while these numbers do not add up correctly, they are exactly as originally published. Probably the total was meant to be 419. PHL ]. Of these three-fourths are foreign born, and eighty are under six years of age. The sexes are kept separate, only meeting at their meals, which are eaten in the same mess-room.[1]",,"Albany, NY",,
New York,Allegany County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Allegany_County_Poor_House,1823,,1924 (Second Location),Closed,Single Building,,Allegany County Home,"In the 1820s, the committee on the poorhouse suggested that there be no distinction between the county and town poor. Allegany county appointed superintendents to the poor who were instructed to buy a farm and to build buildings to house the poor. Mssrs. Van Nostrand, Huff, Lockhart, Gordon and Merrick were apponited to make the nominations for superintendents. These were elected supervisors of the Poor: S. S. Haight (Angelica), Lorenzo Dana (Friendship), Andrew C. Hull (Birdsall), Stephen Major (Almond) and William P. Wilcox (Nunda). A stone building was erected on an 180 acre farm about two miles east of the county courthouse. In 1860, J.H. French noted that it housed an average of 57, inmates, but that the building did not have any means of ventilation. At that time the farm was yielding about $1,000/year.
A little before midnight on March 15, 1923 fire was discovered in the boiler room in the basement of the administration building, above which were the inmates’ dining rooms and kitchen, and the second floor above, the employees’ sleeping quarters. Connected to this by a 50-foot passageway was the women’s dormitory with seven bedridden patients and 14 other inmates plus two babies, one about one year old, and one, three months old. The fourteen women and two babies were removed from the burning building by the concerted efforts of the employees and Mr. and Mrs. Hall, but the seven bedridden patients were not so lucky. Lost to the fire were Miss Sylvia Gibbs, of Granger, 80, Mrs. Addie Olmstead of Belmont, 73, Mrs. Marietta Foster of Wellsville, 75, Miss Christina Grastorf of Wellsville, 52, and Mrs. Hannah Webster of Belfast, 96. One heavy woman, Miss Francis Cooke of Wellsville, sister of Mrs. C. Braunschweiger and Mrs. Fred Dornow of Scio, jumped from the upstairs window and was severely injured. Because she was a large woman, Mrs. Hall was unable to lift her to carry her away from the heat of the burning building and had to roll her over and over.
In a very short time all three buildings were burned to the ground. The only things saved by any inmate, employee, or Hall and his family were the nightclothes they were wearing. They all agreed however that, had it not been for Everett Stafford, an employee who was visiting with Miss Ethel Jennings, the inmate’s cook, who discovered the fire in the boiler room, they too, would probably have been burned to death.
Volunteer fire companies came from Angelica, having made the three mile-run from the town with their hose carts and truck, only to find that their services proved of little value. The pipe through which part of the Alms House water supply came was from a deep well but the pump and heavy pressure air tanks were located in the basement near the boilers and shortly after the firemen arrived, they were out of commission. Through their efforts however, the fire was kept from the stables and the other buildings. At the time of the fire there were 56 inmates, of whom seven were burned to death.  Two employees were also lost in the fire.  Since the last general inspection there had been 20 admissions, 49 discharges, and 14 deaths, including those burned.  All but two of the eleven inmates remained in good health.
The men’s building, the only dwelling to escape destruction, was immediately equipped for the emergency and has since the fire housed some of the staff and inmates. Plans for fireproof structures to replace those that were destroyed, were drawn, and were approved by the State Board of Charities.  The work preliminary to the laying of the foundations has been started.  The farm buildings escaped damage, and farm work continued without check.  One barn had been re-shingled, and another was to be. The dairy herd received a final tuberculin test, as the survivors were free from infection at the time.
The first cemetery is approximately 200 yards east of the barely standing ruins of the County Home buildings behind the only house on the east side.

Occupying 130 acres of land, the Poor Farm would expand into a complex of seventeen buildings. By 1868 the patient population would exceed 1500. By the late 1960's, due to a combination of dwindling population and expansion requirements by neighboring Broome Community College, the Poor Farm was closed. The building was then used for college classrooms.
The Alms House served the Broome County community and stood as an icon at the gateway to Binghamton for well over a century. In 2010, still structrually sound, and although viable plans for adaptive reuse consistent with its surroundings had been proposed, the Broome Community College Board of Trustees had the Alms House demolished.

The Napier family of stonemasons from Machias erected the existing Gothic style Stone House as the Alms-House, for the princely sum $18,000.00. The Napiers were accomplished craftsmen, and also constructed the original Ten Broeck Academy at Franklinville, NY, the Illinois State Capitol at Springfield, Ill., and all the trestles and piling for the NY & Philadelphia Railroad between Machias and Emporium, PA. The 1869 Beers & Co. Atlas of Cattaraugus County depicts a stoUe quarry near the Napier homestead, in southeastern Machias, near the Catt. Co. Highway building on Rt. 16. Due to its proximity to the Napier property and the building's location, it's likely the quarry provided the natural material for the Stone House, which remains as a monument to the industriousness and deft skill of the Napier family.
By 1885, there were 60 residents in the Stone House, including ""paupers, idiots, and epileptics"". Throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries, the Alms-House and farm was a shining example rural self-reliance. The bustling barn complex across the street provided dairy, meat and poultry products for the institution, and was supplemented by bountiful gardens and orchards. The residents and County employees of the institution provided the farm labor. The wood-framed residences and outbuildings were demolished, and the acreage and barn complex across the street were sold in 1957, leaving the Stone House as the sole vestige of a very successful 19u' Century socioeconomic communal enterprise.
Throughout its 135-year history, the Stone House has been on the chopping block before. During construction of the existing nursing home in 1961 and extensive renovations in 1979, the Stone House was also in jeopardy. Thanks to the foresight of the former County Legislatures, however, the Stone House was recognized for its historical value, and spared from demolition. To its credit, the current Legislature has maintained the Stone House in fine condition and it is not a dilapidated, crumbling structure. Today, the fully functional, handicapped-accessible building is utilized by the Catt. County Dept. of Nursing Homes & the Dept. of Health, and open to the public. If you have not seen the building recently, please visit to gain a better appreciation for its remarkable condition and viability.
Finally, the Stone House is a solemn memorial to the 123 (at least) souls buried in the paupers field just north of the Stone House on Rt. 16, across from Lime Lake. These former Indigent residents of the Stone House had no family or funds for interment in a ""mainstream"" cemetery. List of Burials",1979,"Machias, NY",,

In 1832 he County contracted with George Hall to construct a house to accommodate ""at least 100 paupers.""  The building was described as ""a substantial brick county-house, 94 feet long & 32 feet wide"" and cost $2400. By 1833, the cemetery for the poor farm was established. The poor farm became a refuge for the country's poor, lame, insane, blind, sick, abandoned, and abused.  Residents were housed, clothed, fed, and cared for by a resident administrator and his family.  No separate accommodations were provided for the sick, and residents helped to monitor and care for each other. In 1846 additional acreage was purchased, in 1850 a second building was constructed to house the insane, and another building was added in 1857. In 1858, the weekly expense for supporting each resident was $.78, the value of the labor of the residents was $2524, and the expenses associated with the poor farm were $5094. The number of paupers relieved or supported through the poor farm was 4106. In 1867 a new three-story building for the insane was erected at the cost of $17,965. A doctor visited the residents daily, and made special visits when needed. In 1869 the doctor's annual salary was $225.
From 1833 until 1858, over thirty children were reported yearly as residents of the poor farm. Some children were born there, some were vagrants, and some arrived with their parents.  Children between the ages of five and sixteen were to be schooled just as any child attending a common school in the state.
In 1961, the County Home was relocated to a new facility erected at Dunkirk, and the Dewittville property (except the cemetery) was sold.
Beginning in 1864, graves were marked with rectangular numbered stones, and later with round numbered stones. Records kept at the Chautauqua County Home have made it possible to identify approximately 250 individuals who were interred at the cemetery. In 1991, a group of volunteers began clearing the cemetery property to locate all existing markers.  The markers were placed in close proximity to their original locations.",1961,"Dewittville, NY",,

A 180 acre farm with a log house located in Breesport was purchased.  A stone foundation and a small addition were built onto the log house and the County Home opened its doors and was to remain operating for the next 134 years. The first hospital wing was built in 1888, separating the skilled nursing area from the almshouse. At the ""infirmary"" in 1902 there were five iron bathtubs for the men and one enameled iron tub for the women.
Groundbreaking for the present building took place in May of 1969 and was ready for occupancy in July 1971. One hundred residents were transferred from the County Home to the new nursing facility.

There are at the poor house one hundred and twenty-seven inmates, twenty-seven of whom are lunatics. They have been admitted to the poor house at various periods since 1840. Sixteen are males and eleven are females. Twenty-one cases are mild in character. Twenty-six are noted as filthy! Only two have ever been treated in an asylum. Eight males and three females are capable of doing some labor. Others have no amusement provided for them. Five require occasional restraint. There is an inadequate supply of water; there is no bath tub; the lunatics are not required to wash hands and face daily. Cleanliness, ventilation and uniformity of heat in winter are not observed to any particular degree. The rooms have not bedsteads in all of them. Twelve sleep on straw without bedsteads. The straw is changed once or twice a week. The building is heated by coal “poorly applied.” Mild cases are put with the sane paupers. There are no accommodations for the various grades of the insane. One assistant keeper is aided by the sane paupers in the care of lunatics. The atmosphere in the rooms was very impure and unhealthy. The county takes recent cases. Several were admitted in 1863 and 1864. The females have a change of under garments every week; the males none. None had had stockings during the winter; all had shoes. There is no convenience for out of door exercise. No provision is made for medical treatment; they do not receive any medical attendance at all, nor care of any sort with reference to ultimate recovery. Confirmed lunacy and hopeless idiocy is the fate that threatens the unfortunate who passes this threshold.”[1]",,,,

There were about 70 people there and ten of them were ‘insane’. The Poor House was not set up for the care of people with mental illness. It did not function well. People did not have work to do and there was no medical care. The Fulton County Poor House had no children, and it was smaller than other poor houses.
The building was of brick, two stories high, with ceilings of nine feet, the rooms 18 x 50, with windows 4 x 2 1/2 feet. All the rooms have bedsteads in them; the bedding is of straw, and none sleep on straw only. There was no arrangement for ventilation or the uniformity of heat in the winter. The diet provided was simple but nutritious. Everyone was are required to wash their hands and face daily.[1]",,,,
New York,Genesee County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Genesee_County_Poor_House,"December 4, 1826",,1827,Closed,,,,"An act to provide for the establishment of county poorhouses was passed in Albany in 1824. On December 4, 1826 the Genesee County Board of Supervisors met in Bethany for the purpose of establishing a County Poorhouse.  A brick building, originally a stagecoach tavern, located near the corner of the Bethany Center Road and Raymond Road was the site selected, as it represented the geographical center of the county. (Wyoming County wasn’t established until 1841.) The following official announcement, dated December 9, 1826, appeared in an issue of the Batavia Times newspaper:
“Notice is hereby given that the Genesee County Poorhouse will be ready for the reception of paupers on the first day of January 1827 … The Overseers of the Poor of the several towns of the County of Genesee are requested, in all cases of removal of paupers to the county poorhouse, to send with them their clothing, beds, bedding and such other articles belonging to the paupers as may be necessary and useful to them.”
The following were eligible for assistance: habitual drunkards, lunatics (one who by disease, grief or accident lost the use of reason or from old age, sickness or weakness was so weak of mind as to be incapable of governing or managing their affairs), paupers (a person with no means of income), state paupers (one who is blind, lame, old or disabled with no income source) or a vagrant.
Causes of pauperism are listed and in 1867 the Superintendent of the Poor reported that of the 1,018 poor, 706 had become paupers by intemperance (excessive drinking of alcoholic liquor).  Another document noted that a man had died leaving behind a widow and fatherless children and with no means of support the mother and children become residents of the County Home.
In 1828 the County constructed a stone building attached to the Poorhouse for the confinement of lunatics and a repository for paupers committed for misconduct.  The insane were also housed at the County Home until 1887 when the Board of Supervisors agreed to send “persons suffering with acute insanity to the Buffalo State Asylum and cases of violent, chronic insanity to Willard.
A list of those who died while living in the County Home was recently complied by the History Department staff.  Information was found in the Registration Books, the list of coffins purchased, mortuary listings and reports from the Superintendents of the Poor to the County Board of Supervisors.  Information on the cemetery located at the County Home is almost nonexistent.  The 1886 Proceedings stated “The burying ground we have improved by building a fence in front and grading and leveling the ground as much as could be done without injury to the graves.”  An actual cemetery register or plot map has yet to be discovered.  The County did bury those who had no family to care for the dead and the receipts provide us only with clues.
Occasionally an obituary will include information regarding an individual who once resided and died at the County Home.  Phebe White has the distinction of being an inmate for 58 years, having entered the County Home at the age of 9 in 1828, shortly after it opened.  She was listed as idiotic and at the age of 49 became blind.  Phebe was one of the first recipients of the care and protection provided by the County Home. The Superintendent of the Poor estimated her total care cost the county $7,000.  The 1871 Proceedings listed 146 persons had been provided for at a cost to keep each at $1.08 per week per resident.  The County Home included a working farm and woods which provided food and fuel, therefore the actual cost to care these individuals was low.
A memorial site was created in the Genesee County Park and on June 6, 2004 the Genesee County Historians dedicated a historical marker honoring those who died while living in the County Home from 1827 until 1974 when the facility was closed and relocated to Batavia.  In addition to the bronze plaque marker there are five headstones which were returned last fall to the County by Lori Carlson, the current property owner of the former County Poorhouse.  These stones date from 1887 to 1888 and the History Department staff was able to find the receipts for the stones which indicated the County purchased them for $5.00 each. The reason they were never used is unknown.  The cemetery for the County Poorhouse has faded away as the stones crumpled, the grass grew and the forest replanted.  No one was around to care for those who had so long ago been forgotten.  These people, though they were poor, ill and sometime abandoned, do deserve to be remembered. [1]",1974,,,

New York,Brooklyn State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kings_County_Lunatic_Asylum,,1852,1856,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Original),,Flatbush Insane Asylum | Kings County Asylum | Kings County Lunatic Asylum | Long Island State Hospital | Kingsboro State Hospital | Kingsboro Psychiatric Center,"The main building of Kings County Lunatic Asylum, located in Flatbush, was funded by Chapter 278 of the Laws of 1852, which authorized Kings County to negotiate a loan for the extension of hospital accommodations for care of the insane in connection with its almshouse. A further authorization, made by Chapter 255 of the Laws of 1853, provided for a loan to complete the institution under construction. This amount proved insufficient and an additional loan was authorized by Chapter 927 of the Laws of 1855.
The building as originally planned was to consist of an administration building and four wings, but when it opened only two wings had been erected. The institution received its first patients in April 1854; by the end of the first month of operation it was caring for 178 patients. The demand for more room for patients necessitated an enlargement, and four additional wings were built, two on either side of the original main building. The first two were occupied by patients on June 1, 1861, and the latter two on July 1, 1869. To make room for more patients, a building originally erected on the almshouse grounds as a nursery was remodeled for asylum use; 267 patients were subsequently transferred there. Known as the ""Hospital for Incurables,"" it functioned as a separate institution until May 1884, when it became part of the main asylum.
In February 1882, a fire occurred in the main building and destroyed the rear portion of the easterly end of the men's wards. After repair the building was used without extensive modifications until 1911, when the electric wiring and plumbing were renewed and fireproof stairways and steel ceilings were installed.
In 1885, a farm was purchased at St. Johnland (on the northern side of Long Island about 40 miles from the city of Brooklyn) as a site for a branch institution to relieve the overcrowding at Flatbush. This branch later developed into the Kings Park State Hospital. Transfer of patients to the branch began in the fall of 1885. The two institutions were under one management until 1900.
Kings County Lunatic Asylum became the Long Island State Hospital and was transferred to the state by the county on July 1, 1895. In 1900, the St. Johnland branch was given separate management and became Long Island State Hospital at Kings Park; the main part of the institution became Long Island State Hospital at Flatbush (Laws of 1900, Chapter 634). In 1916, Long Island State Hospital at Kings Park was renamed Kings Park State Hospital; Long Island State Hospital at Flatbush was renamed Brooklyn State Hospital.
In May 1916, ground was broken on the Brooklyn site for a reception hospital for 150 patients, and for a building for continued treatment cases to accommodate 400 people. These buildings were completed and open to use in 1919. That same year a contract was let for the construction of another building for continued treatment cases with a capacity of 400 people. The building was completed and occupied in 1921. In 1974, Brooklyn State Hospital was renamed Brooklyn Psychiatric Center. In 1975, it was renamed again to Kingsboro Psychiatric Center.
Brooklyn State Hospital is under the jurisdiction of the State Department of Mental Hygiene. It takes nervous and mental cases from Kings County. The institution has 2,725 beds with complete facilities for observation care, and treatment. The Brooklyn State Hospital was opened in 1895, taking over some of the functions handled by the Kings County Hospital. During the past twenty years all the old buildings have been replaced by fireproof modern structures. The hospital grounds cover twenty-eight acres, and around the nineteen-story central building, opened in 1935, are grouped a number of ward and service buildings. Additions now being constructed will increase the bed capacity to 3,250.

New York,Livingston County House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Livingston_County_House,1829,,,Active,,,Livingston County Poorhouse,"The Livingston County House was established in 1829. The first Livingston County poorhouse is believed to have been located on the south side of Route 20a. Gradually as the population of the county increased, the original poorhouse became inadequate to accommodate the growing number of impoverished residents.”[1] This establishment has been around for nearly 195 years. Throughout the years this place has had multiple transitions. Originally, Livingston was used for housing for the elderly, orphans, the mentally ill individuals, and for anyone who was not able to work. The building, Livingston, was structured in different sections. On the lower level there was an education section and a wash hose and shoe shop. Then, on the next floor above there was an asylum for women who dealt with mental illness.
Throughout the lifetime of Livingston, it held a cemetery of hundreds of deceased people, of whom mainly had unmarked graves, until a law was passed that made marking graves as a requirement. During 1868 there was a fire that occurred in the poor house. The building completely burned down. After the fire Livingston continued to expand their farmland, which produced “livestock, crops, and fruit trees.[2] By 1925, Livingston was producing eggs and butter for sale. Livingston continued to grow and thrive as they increased their acres of farmland. In 1989, “The three brick buildings were sold and the center building was remodeled to operate as the Oak Valley Inn”[3]",,"4222 Lakeville Rd, Geneseo, NY 14454, USA",,
New York,Madison County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Madison_County_Poor_House,,,,,,,,"1864 Madison County Poor House
“The statistics from Madison county reveal a most deplorable condition of the insane poor. It is shocking, it is shameful.
The poor house contains ninety-four paupers, twenty-five of whom are insane. They are, with three exceptions, of American birth. The records of the institution do not show the dates of their admission. Inspection shows that fifteen of this number are filthy in their habits, and that only five have ever been treated in an asylum. Nine are capable of doing some labor. The remainder have nothing to do; fourteen are destructive to their clothing. The house has no bathing tub, the insane are not even required to bathe at all, and the violent insane not even to wash their hands and face. It is idle to describe the building, it is heart-sickening to describe what is in it. Eighteen sleep on straw, without bed or bedding; the straw is changed once a week. The food is distributed in tin dishes. No uniformity of heat in winter seems to be aimed at. The mild cases have their liberty during the day. Not so the violent. The only care they receive is from the hands of incompetent paupers. Those confined in the cells are extremely filthy, most of them not using vessels, and their excrements are mixed with the straw on which they lie. Their straw is changed only once in a week; and these lunatics, with their “bodies besmeared with their own excrements, not allowed to come daily to the open air, eating in the same filthy apartments, are not washed from one years end to another.” The cells in which they are confined are only 4 x 6 feet, with a ceiling of 7 feet, and open into a hall, so that they can have no ventilation. “A bad stench” issues from them; and in this stench the lunatics are forced to live—live a life more terrible than a hundred deaths. Three males were in a state of nudity; the females wore only chemises; but the mild cases are clothed like other paupers. Fourteen had neither shoes nor stockings during the winter!!
This vile prison is designed to make confirmed maniacs of twenty-five persons; that is, it pretends to have accommodations for twenty-five, and their treatment would only serve to make them incurable. The books do not show what is the greatest number confined there at any one time. They are not visited by a physician, and receive no care with reference to their ultimate recovery.
Cannot the voice of humanity be awakened? Shall not legislative authority be exercised for their relief?”

New York,Monroe County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Monroe_County_Poor_House,1826,,1827/1931,Preserved,Single Building,Siegmund Firestone,Monroe County Almshouse | Monroe County Home & Infirmary | Monroe Community Hospital for the Care of the Chronically Ill | Monroe Community Hospital (Current),"The Monroe County Poor-House, situated three miles southeast from Rochester, was erected by the county in 1826. It was constructed of brick, and was calculated to accommodate from seventy-five to one hundred paupers. It was managed by five superintendents, and had, in 1827, thirty-five occupants, about twenty of whom were employed in useful labor. Population increased, and the building became old and overcrowded. The raving maniac, the young child, the infirm old man, and the seducer’s victim, were crowded in a building whose
remembrance must seem painful. Humanity called for a removal of the child from baneful influences, and a separation of the insane from the sane. In 1855 a school was taught by Miss Benedict, and contained some forty scholars. A schoolhouse was finished in 1859. It contained two stories, the lower being for a schoolroom, the upper for a dormitory.
In 1860 a building was set apart for the infirm old men. Year after year the buildings became more dilapidated, and the report in favor of new buildings passed unheeded until early in 1872, when the commissioners began to act in a manner which set the future at rest upon this question. The almshouse was located midway between the insane asylum and the penitentiary, and fifty feet south. By 1862 the number of patients admitted to the Asylum necessitated the erection of a separate building.
By 1929 concerns with overcrowding and fire safety at the Almshouse prompted the County to review the future of the building. County officials commissioned Siegmund Firestone, a notable Rochester architect and engineer, to investigate the current situation and to recommend a plan for its future. It was Mr. Firestone who made the recommendation that the County consider building a new facility better suited to care for the growing number of long-term and chronic care patients and to move the building’s location to East Henrietta Road. The County accepted his plan, and Firestone was hired to design and oversee the construction of this new facility.
Construction of the building that we now know as Monroe Community Hospital began in 1931, in the midst of the nation’s Great Depression. Mr. Firestone incorporated many innovative ideas into his design of the building and ensured that the project employed all local contractors. Mr. Firestone also hired a talented young architectural student and draftsman Thomas Boyde, Jr. as one of his assistants, and Boyde then became the first African-American architect in the community. Following nearly three years of construction and at a cost of $4 million, the new facility opened as the Monroe Community Home and Infirmary on August 1, 1933. The innovations in interior design as well as the beautiful, ornate exterior earned national recognition. The building was heralded as a model health care facility, and one publication called it “the most efficient installation of its kind anywhere.” It set new standards for hospital design, balancing the intertwined medical, psychological, and social needs of its residents with the need for efficient, cost-effective care.
From the 1930s through the 1950s, Monroe County Home and Infirmary functioned as a general hospital, providing medical, surgical, maternity, pediatric, and dental services for the indigent. In 1967, the County changed the facility’s name to the Monroe Community Hospital for the Care of the Chronically Ill. The name change reflected a shift to address the rising population of elderly in the community. At that time, Monroe County also entered into an agreement with the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry to provide medical personnel and services, improving upon the quality and continuity of patient care.
The population that MCH serves today, however, has changed significantly from its early days. MCH now provides long-term care and rehabilitation for residents of all ages, from eight-week old infants to centenarians. Nearly three-quarters of the residents at MCH use wheelchairs, and the majority have complex medical and psychological needs requiring extensive medical and nursing care.",,"Rochester, NY",,

New York,Onondaga County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Onondaga_County_Poor_House,,,1827,Closed,Cottage Planned,,Onondaga County Poor House | Onondaga County Poor Farm | Onondaga County Home & Infirmary | Van Duyn Home & Hospital | Van Duyn | Onondaga Community College,"During most of the 1800s, the Poor House and its attached asylum for the mentally ill packed together a broad assortment of individuals.  Most were simply poor and did not have the personal or family means for care.
They suffered from a stunning variety of social ills; an 1977 report listed: Alcoholism, Vagrancy, Destitute, Lunacy, Sickness, Old Age, Debauchery Bastardy, Blindness, Lameness, Idiocy,.  Many were undereducated and poor from birth.  Others had once been successful citizens, but fell on hard times.  One 1871 report mentioned a young Civil War veteran residing in the ""insane department,"" whose case today would be classified as severe post-traumatic stress disorder.
Throughout the 19th century, society debated how to hand all these ills.  Some citizens blamed individual moral weirdness and wanted to limit public expense, satisfied with simply locking such individuals out of sight.  Others saw a need for better, specialized facilities and more targeted social programs.
Poor House admissions often depended on political connections and the quality of staffing could vary from sensitive to uncaring to occasionally brutal.  Pressed by local newspaper reports, reformers and state legislation, county leaders would commit to major improvements during the next century.
The first building on the grounds was a simple limestone structure that opened in 1827.  It sufficed for a time, but in the early 1850's, increasing immigration from Europe and the rapid growth of Syracuse's population brought about considerable crowding.  An average of 200 individual were houses at a time in a facility intended for no more than 150.
In 1854 a major addition was built, but an 1857 state report criticized the compound's inadequate care of the 16 residents labeled as ""lunatics.""  New additions were built for the mentally ill in the 1860s.  But the county facility was never properly staffed of designed for such specialized care.  By 1893, all mental patients had been transferred to state hospitals.
But by the start of the 20th century, with the county population nearing 200,000, the four 19th century buildings were increasingly seen as inadequate.
By 1900, the Poor House, now known as County Home, no longer had to care for the blind, those with mental illness or for children.  But it faced a growing number of occupants, especially as Syracuse's population soared toward 20,000.  And there were always sick, frail and even pregnant residents.  Various rooms were designated over time as infirmary wards but always proved deficient.  Pressed by local physicians and the state, the country finally relented and erected a 60-bed hospital for the site in 1900.  It marked a key transformation in the history of ""The Home"" and of local public care for the indigent.
By 1907, despite the new hospital, the only buildings regularly housing residents were more than 50 years old, greatly crowded, shared by both sexes, and viewed by the state as dangerous firetraps.  The country responded by building a separate new Women's Dormitory in 1908 and thren a ""fireproof"" brick addition for men in 1915.  The latter was attacked to the exisiting row of stone buildings.  The hospital, undersized from the outset, was expanded with the 1928 construction of an additional building (Now known as OCC's H-1 hall), which increased bed capacity to over 100.
The Great Depression pushed the unemployment to nearly 25%.  By 1931, the Home was housing 738 residents in a space meant for 500. Portions of the stone buildings, over 100 years old, were crowded and fire hazards.  Most were replaced by 1932 with a new men's dormitory, providing needed construction jobs for the community.
By the decade's end, the creation of new federal social welfare programs allowed more of the able-bodied poor to maintain their own, independent housing.
The Home's population increasingly tended to be infirm residents, requiring more medical assistance then just housing.  By the late 1950s, it was functioning primarily as a nursing home and hospital.  Its purpose was evolving into one of extended care and rehabilitation.
The Home took over a nearby, former tuberculosis sanitarium in 1950 to secure better hospital facilities, while retaining its original location.  County officials soon realized however, that increasing state and federal regulations made the motley assemblage of buildings composing the new renamed Van Duyn Home & Hospital unsuitable for the future.
In 1974 the county decided to build a single, 524-bed facility on the sanitarium grounds.  The present Van Duyn opened in 1979 and all patients were transferred there.  For the first time since 1827, the former Poor House grounds and buildings stood empty.  [1]
Today, the Onondaga Community College now occupies most of what had been the Poor House property.  The center of the college lies in what had been the poor house farm.  While the majority of the buildings of the original poor house has been torn down, the hospital extension and the women's dormitory was rebuilt by OCC and is now being used as new lecture halls.",1978 (The original grounds),Onondaga NY,,

New York,Putnam County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Putnam_County_Poor_House,,,1894,,,,,"The Putnam County Poor House was open from 1894-1961. The poor house and farm laid across 150 acres of land located on Country Farm Road. It had barns and buildings that not only housed the inmates, but housed the manager and his family at the time. There was no electricity on the farms, and for water, they had to use a hydraulic ram. Some of the jobs that were done there included wheat thrashing and butchering animals for materials. Eventually a screen room was added by Oakley and Lawrence Chaffin to confine mentally disturbed people. Life in any poor house was not great and people died on the farms and in the poor house. It was common enough that they had homemade coffins and when someone passed, they would take them to the cemetery on the farm and bury them. This land now, has been cultivated and the cemetery no longer is there.
Aside from the structure of the farm, it was controlled by the County Court which was made up of one justice of the peace from each district. The justice of the peace is now known as the County Commissioner. At one point in the history of the poor house, someone named Bill Rippletoe was the manager. During his time there, a little boy showed up at the farm looking to work there. Rippletoe and his wife felt so bad that they ended up adopting the boy. Alvin Palk was another manager, after Rippletoe who left the farm and came back until the early nineteen fifties. Then, the county court decided to close the county home and move the patients into a nursing home. After these patients were moved, Putnam County hired a county health doctor to check out the people that were at the county home and to vaccinate the school children of the county. After the county home finally closed, Willow Avenue Church of Christ leased the property for Happy Haven Home for children. [1]",1961,,,

The chain of mills used water power routed along a series of tunnels engineered by Marshall in the 1840s. These textile mills were among the earliest parts of the industrial development of Troy in the early 19th century. Marshall became a wealthy and prominent citizen of Troy in the mid-19th century until his death in 1858. Marshall founded the Marshall Infirmary as a hospital 1848 that included patients who were mentally ill. The Infirmary was incorporated in 1851 and in 1858 Marshall died and his will created a trust to help support the Infirmary.
The first building was built on his estate on Linden Avenue and during the Civil War and later years, additional wings and buildings were added to the Infirmary. During the Civil War, the Rensselaer County appropriated funding to pay the Infirmary to care for the county’s mentally ill patients. About 1900, the name was changed to Marshall Sanitarium. During the Depression years, the Sanitarium had financial difficulties, but survived and continued to operate as an asylum until 1964. The Board of Governors in that year considered the changes in medical care of the mentally ill and the expense of renovating their buildings and acquiring modern equipment. Because the Sanitarium could not afford to modernize their buildings and equipment, the governors decided to close the Sanitarium.",1964,"Troy, NY",,

Over the next few years a cholera hospital and insane asylum were built along with housing for the poor.  The residents worked on the farm in exchange for food and housing.
In 1902 the name of the farm was changed to the New York City Farm Colony.  At this time the farm contained sixteen buildings, including dormitories, a dining and kitchen building, laundry and industrial building, shops, nurses residence and a morgue among others.  The area also contained the Staten Island Potters Field and it was used as a cemetery until 1905.
Across the street from the Farm a 25 acre estate of Charles Schmidt known as Ocean View became the proposed location of a tuberculosis hospital in 1905. Seaview Hospital was opened on November 12, 1913 at this location.
The Farm merged with Seaview Hospital in 1915 and the entire area was renamed Seaview Farm, till 1921 when the merger ended.  The Farm expanded throughout the 1930's and slowly became  mostly an old age home. Seaview Hospital became the first tuberculosis hospital to have a maternity ward and led the country in the treatment and caring of TB patients. Research at the hospital would help end the tuberculosis epidemic.
In 1961 the Farm once again merged with Seaview Hospital, the hospital phasing out its tuberculosis wards and slowly becoming a geriatric hospital. Most of the TB facility built in the 1930s is still in use although the old farm colony and isolation ward buildings are abandoned or have been demolished.",,"Staten Island, NYC, NY",,
New York,Summit Park Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rockland_County_House,,,1918/1937,Preserved,Single Building,,Rockland County Infirmary | Summit Park Hospital,"The Summit Park Sanatorium was erected in 1918 after a popular vote for its construction was taken by the citizens of Rockland County, and in accordance with Section 45 of the County Law, which provided that counties with a population of 35,000 or more must establish and maintain a county hospital for the care and treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis. This building was located on the grounds where Building L is located today.
The sanatorium, a two-story frame structure with open, unheated porches, was equipped to accommodate forty-six patients, although within a few years the hospital maintained a daily average of fifty-five patients. The first patient was admitted on October 14, 1919. Steady growth of the Institution necessitated provisions for a nurses' home, employees' quarters, Recreational Hall and Occupational Therapy Shop, and a Superintendent's residence. To meet those needs, two additional buildings were constructed in 1925.
The progress made in the treatment of tuberculosis in the early 20th century was unparalleled. Treatment had previously consisted of climatic changes and fresh air with little regard to rest or the comfort of the patient. With the extensive use of surgery in the treatment of tuberculosis, the Summit Park Sanatorium was considered a modern hospital, and was equipped with X-rays, clinical laboratories, operating room facilities, and comfortably heated rooms.
By the early 1930's, the building required significant reconstruction, but after careful study, this was found impossible. Furthermore, the State no longer approved of extensive remodeling of any hospital building whose construction was known to be a fire hazard. In the Fall of 1935, Rockland County obtained an outright grant of $204,952.00 from the Federal Government which was matched by $250,000.00 by the County, or a total appropriation of $454,952.00 for construction, sewerage, and complete equipment for a ""new"" Summit Park. Ground was broken on March 5, 1936 and construction began in May 1936. The work progressed rapidly, and the building was occupied on May 26, 1937. The new Summit Park Sanatorium was considered one of the finest institutions in the country. It was fireproof, tastefully furnished, and completely equipped with all the latest therapeutic facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases.
Dr. Robert L. Yeager was named Superintendent and Medical Director of Summit Park Sanatorium in 1942 and during his tenure was a leading force in the growth of what is now known as The Dr. Robert L. Yeager Health Center.  In the mid-1960's, Dr. Yeager took the lead along with two other county agencies, Department of Health and Department of Mental Health, in a monumental project that would bring together the three agencies to one health complex. He was named Director of the Department of Health and Hospitals in 1974.
In October of 1977, Summit Park Hospital along with the Rockland County Infirmary nursing home in Building C, relocated to Building A of the 110-acre campus. The Summit Park Sanatorium (Building L), was converted to office space and currently houses the Department of Social Services.
Dr. Yeager retired in 1980 after 42 years of unparalleled service to the county.  In 1987, the Rockland County Health Center was officially changed to The Dr. Robert L. Yeager Health Center.  Dr. Yeager was known to be ""tough minded"" but soft spoken and kept a low profile.  He opposed having the complex named after him and at the dedication ceremony is quoted as saying the following, ""In principle, that one person should be honored above so many others is embarrassing.""
Dr. Yeager was succeeded after his retirement by James M. Jones, MPH, a native of Haverstraw, NY.   Jones was named Rockland County's first Commissioner of Health and Hospitals.
Summit Park Hospital was named an LTACH (long-term acute care hospital) in the 1990's, and today it is the only Long Term Acute Care Hospital in Rockland, Orange and Westchester Counties.
The Almshouse had been vacated in 1957, when residents were moved to the renamed Rockland County Infirmary and Home at Summit Park. The original welfare home was a frame structure built in 1837, the year the 47-acre parsonage farm property was bought for that purpose by the county Commissioners of the Poor from the Dutch Reformed Church of West New Hempstead.
The frame edifice was replaced in 1883 by the first of three sections constructed of brick from the thriving Haverstraw brickyards. The south section came later, followed by the connecting west wing to form the current ""U"" shape. The building was demolished to make room for the new Rockland Community College in 1959.",1977,,,
New York,St. Lawrence County Alms House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Lawrence_County_Alms_House,,,,Demolished,,,,"The St. Lawrence County Poorhouse, Almshouse or County Home as it was referred to was completed in 1869, and was located two miles downstream from Canton, NY, toward Ogdensburg, on a prominent piece of Grasse River frontage. The County Home was built in response to the County Poorhouse Act passed by New York State legislature in 1824. The home was a place where the less fortunate could seek refuge, even if only for a night. It was built to accommodate up to 300 residents (or what were then called ‘’inmates’’) at a time. Like all almshouses in New York in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was funded by taxpayers and managed by the county government. The Home was heated, clean, well aerated, and had an infirmary as well as a separate area for the insane. However, St. Lawrence County Almshouse officials were negligent in initiating the required admission forms for each inmate as there are many that are missing. Those seeking refuge in the home were either ‘indigent,’ ‘poor,’ ‘sick,’ ‘feeble minded,’ or insane. Immigrant men, women, and children as well as those from the local area found their way to the home. Immigrant residents were from a variety of places including Canada, Mexico, Ireland, and Austria.
For over 100 years more than 2000 residents made use of the home, and over 700 found their final resting place within the home’s cemetery. 500+ of these graves are unmarked and are in danger of being eroded by the Grasse River.  The grave markers likely did not stand the test of time as they were often made from wood, because the County did not have the financial resources to put a tombstone on every grave. The building itself was destroyed in 1978, taking with it the voices of many of St. Lawrence County’s most vulnerable residents. [1][2][3][4]",,"Canton, NY",,

New York,Seneca County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Seneca_County_Poor_House,,,1830/1852,Preserved,Single Building,,,"The first meeting of the superintendents of the poor of Seneca County was held on February 3, 1830 at the Waterloo Hotel, kept by L. Lynch. The appointed superintendents were:
Dr. Anthony D. Schuyler of Romulus, Dr. Claudius C. Coan of Ovid-Lodi, William Hoskins of Seneca Falls, William Larzelere of Fayette, and Joel W. Bacon of Waterloo. William Larzelere was asked to look for a suitable building to rent that would accommodate the poor. The other members of the committee were asked to visit the poor houses of the adjoining counties and then report back on their programs. They met again on February 26, at the inn of William Hoskins. William Larzelere informed the other members of the committee that he was not able to find a suitable house that could be rented, but said that John P. Silvers offered to sell a house and land on Lots 7 and 16 in Romulus (Fayette). By April 9, the superintendents were meeting at the poor house. They planned to put an addition on the building but decided to delay it for a time. They were busy dealing with the litigation in the courts at the time to divide the county. They did complete plans to remodel the upper story of the building which was just a garret at that time. They laid floors and divided the attic into separate rooms.
A committee comprised of John D. Coe and Richard R. Steele reported to the board of supervisors at the November 25, 1850, meeting on their study of poor house construction. They
had visited poor houses in other counties and examined the building in Seneca County. They suggested it would be better to build a new structure instead of trying to fix up the existing building. The Latham Brothers of Seneca Falls were the ones who got the contract. Their bid was, for brick, $7,395; for stone, $7,249. The Latham Brothers, notable builders of their day who built the stone mills in Seneca Falls and a number of other buildings throughout the state, got the contract for building the poor house because they submitted the lowest bid.
A quarry on the property provided the limestone that was used for the walls, the lintels and stills, the water table, and large entablature. The new structure was completed in 1853. There was a Federal-style doorway that included sidelights and a transom. Like the original structure it replaced, there was a main building and a side wing to the east. There was a wide porch that stretched across the front. As was suggested at the time of construction, the structure was built so sturdily that it would last for generations.
The institutional system for the poor began to decline in the 1920s as social work became a profession, and both national and state laws, such as worker’s compensation laws, state pension laws, and unemployment and health insurance laws, were passed. Almshouses were crowded during the Great Depression, but by the late 1930s, mainly because of New Deal legislation, the majority of the poor lived in their own homes and received public assistance. Although never politically abolished, poorhouses were nonexistent by the 1950s.
Approximately 1970, the former poor house building was remodeled and used by the county’s Department of Social Services until it moved into the new county office building in
December 1989. On June 18, 1999, the property was purchased by Greystone Enterprises LLC, with Jonathan Buchwald as the managing partner. The house was converted into apartments.
The “pauper” graveyard back of the house is still owned by the county.",1970,"Waterloo, NY",,

The Poor House became a catch-all for all types of wasted humanity. Criminals, lunatics, cripples- all were herded under the same roof with the poverty-stricken. The Poor House was the solution to a wide range of social ills. No consideration was given to either the person who was called an ""inmate,"" or to the cause of his or her problem. In 1929 New York State mandated that all institutions known as a ""poor house"" or an ""almshouse"" change the name. As a result, the Suffolk County Almshouse changed its name to the Suffolk County Home.
In 1937, a new brick Suffolk County Home was built further down Yaphank Avenue. After 1938, residents were no longer required to work, but many chose to do so until 1940. In 1994, the John J. Foley Skilled Nursing Facility was opened and the old brick building became Suffolk County Offices.",1994,"Yaphank, NY",,
New York,Tompkins County Poor House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tompkins_County_Poor_House,,,1829/1892,Closed,Single Building,,,"Tompkins county voted in favor of building a poorhouse on November 22, 1827. The county clerk allocated $4,000 for the facility, with $1,500 to be raised in the present year, $1,250 in 1828, and $1,250 in 1829. A wooden structure was erected with room for 75 individuals on farmland located in the township of Ulysses circa 1829. The building was altered and repaired circa 1876.
On November 20, 1891, a committee was appointed to study whether the existing county home could be renovated further or whether a new complex was required. The existing building was in poor condition and required major repairs. In February 1892, it was decided to authorize a new building and in June, $20,000 was appropriated by the county for that purpose. The new building was built of brick and completed later in the year. By 1976, the county home was one of the last in the state to have a fully integrated farm operation. 3 Many of the 58 residents participate in everyday clean-up activities, dusting rooms, making beds, sweeping floors and washing dishes. Many of the men work on the farm, earning up to $20 per week. Their wages were limited, as earning more than that would affect their Social Security income.
The County Commissioner of Social Services recommended in November 1980 to close the farm at the county home. 5 The commissioner noted the farm lost $20,000 per year for the past five years. Rising labour costs and government regulations made the farm unprofitable and a liability. The county legislature voted to end farming operations at the county home in 1981. In December 1986, the county voted to close the county home by December 31, 1987, because of declining enrollment, deteriorating buildings and new state regulations. On February 25, 1987, the last two of the 24 county home residents moved out. Eleven employees remained until October to winterise the buildings.",1987,"Jacksonville, NY",,

New York,Eloise Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wayne_County_Poor_House,1839,,1841,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Wayne County Poorhouse | Eloise Hospital | Wayne County Asylum | Wayne County Psychiatric Hospital,"In 1839, only two years after Michigan had joined the Union, Wayne County paid $800 to buy a 160-acre farm in Nankin Township (now Westland). The purchase included a log cabin known as the Black Horse Tavern. The County erected an addition to the tavern building and used it to house 35 needy people, a keeper and his wife. They called it the Wayne County Poorhouse. Its first residents were transferred from another poorhouse at Gratiot and Mt. Elliott in Detroit . Many refused to move, claiming the new poorhouse was ""too far out in the wilderness."" And they were right -- at that time the corner of Michigan and Merriman was nearly two days by stage coach from Detroit.
But that was what the county officials had in mind. They wanted somewhere well out of sight to send what they saw as society's dregs -- the vagrants, vagabonds, drunkards, pilferers and brawlers. With such a broad charter, it wasn't long before the feeble-minded and the insane were being housed there. Records show that a Biddy Hughes was Eloise's first official mental patient, committed by her family in 1841. She was in her mid-30s when admitted and was kept there until her death 58 years later.
Prior to the 1840s, little distinction was made between rational and mentally ill inmates. A county report from the 1840s made reference to harsh restraints used to separate the mentally ill from other inmates. The mentally ill were housed on the upper floor of a farm building used to keep pigs.
County employee Stanislas M. Keenan reported in his 1913 book, ""The History of Eloise,"" that in the first few years people in the surrounding area heard ""the chained unfortunates roaring and shrieking in discord with the squealing pigs beneath."" Conditions improved in 1869 when the mentally ill were moved to a new building where they were supervised by a neighboring farmer and his wife. But the chains remained until 1881, when Dr. E.O. Bennett, Eloise's first medical superintendent, did away with them.
In 1894 the Wayne County Poorhouse got a new name. Freeman B. Dickerson, president of the county board overseeing care of the poor, renamed the facility Eloise, after his 5-year-old daughter. The county eventually split the facility into the Eloise Infirmary for the Sick and Elderly and the Eloise Hospital for the Insane.
In 1903, after a sharp increase in tuberculosis cases, it was recommended that these patients be separated from the general hospital population. A canvass hospital was erected consisting of two tents -- one for males and one for females. As the number of TB patients increased Eloise Sanitarium was built. In a report to the auditors in 1911, a Dr. Dutlitz says, ""The erection of this hospital was an answer to the public call."" He said physicians were practically unanimous in recommending open air treatment for tuberculosis of the lungs.
The patients at Eloise posed a special problem, however. By the time they got to Eloise they were in the final stages of the disease. They were sent there from other treatment centers when their personal funds were exhausted, leaving them candidates for the poorhouse. Eloise continued to operate what was essentially a TB hospital for indigents until 1923, when the State and City of Detroit began providing facilities.
In the 1930's Wayne County began feeling the effects of the Depression. Eloise grew rapidly as both the indigent and mentally ill populations multiplied. In 1932, a barracks was erected to house unemployed men. By 1934 the inmate population averaged more than 8,300, about 50 percent of them mentally ill, and the number of employees had risen to nearly 2,000. For residents, boredom was a major problem. A 1939 Detroit News article described the daily routine: ""The residents rise at 7 a.m. and go to bed at 7:30 p.m. Between times, they sit and stare at the wall, at their feet, at the windows. There is no exercise or organized social movement."" Some inmates received passes to leave the grounds where they became easy targets for policemen, who arrested and fined them for petty crimes. Most found the outside world difficult to cope with. Many spent their leaves at local bars and ended up in jail. Others walked the surrounding neighborhoods aimlessly..
Eloise grew into a city unto itself. Its 78 buildings included a fire department, 15-man police force, powerhouses, a cannery, bakery and fruit cellar, a sewage disposal plant a morgue, laundry facilities; a library and low-rent employee lodgings. Nearly 20 percent of the staff lived on the grounds.
In 1945, Eloise was renamed Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary. The new name was intended to reflect the modern ""scientific"" approaches to caring for the poor and mentally ill that had been instituted at the facility. Most, however, continued to refer to the facility as Eloise.
By the 1950's Wayne County General was considered one of the best hospitals in the nation. It played a major part in metro Detroit's health network. It was the only acute-care medical and surgical hospital between Detroit and Ypsilanti. Needy patients would have died without Wayne County General. A reporter who toured the facility in 1953 was moved by the ""pitiful cases"" -- ""the senile, the spastics, the polio victims and those with advanced multiple sclerosis.""  By the '50s, patients were benefiting from insulin and electric shock therapy, psychotherapy by psychiatrists and occupational and recreational therapy. Occupational therapy included farming, sewing, work in the hospital laundry and maintenance departments. Recreational therapy included classes in handiwork and a special division of music therapy.
Throughout its boom years, when the complex was caring for as many as 10,000 patients daily, the facility was plagued by reports of patient beatings, employee theft, mismanagement, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding. At one time 3,800 mental patients -- including 300 with tuberculosis -- were crammed into quarters designed for 2,500. As many as 125 women had to share five toilets.
By 1955 money problems had become acute. George E. Gullen Jr., chairman of the Wayne County chapter of the Michigan Society of Mental Health, figured that on a per patient basis, Wayne General was ""the most expensive mental hospital in the world."" The county continually sought ways to cut costs. One auditor questioned the practice of buying false teeth at $100 a set for indigent TB patients, after noting that $6,500 had been spent on dentures in one six-month period.
Not all was bleak at Eloise. A carnival was held each summer on the hospital grounds with booths built by patients. Patients also ran a coffee shop in the psychiatric building. ""They must face life and its stresses and we want them ready to do that,"" explained one of the doctors. Proceeds were used to buy recreational supplies.
By 1960 new theories for treatment of the mentally ill were developing, and Eloise kept in step. The goal was no longer to provide long term care, but to return patients to society as soon as possible. Most were kept less than 90 days and in 1964 only one in ten became permanent residents -- compared to nearly 50 percent previously. This success added to Eloise's money problems. The state chipped in for psychiatric expenses only after patients had been hospitalized for a year.
Wayne County also began ""mainstreaming"" -- getting the psychiatric patient back into the community each week. This sometimes caused problems. One patient was so excited about his weekend leave that he stole a car from the hospital parking lot. There was a high speed chase in which he was involved in five collisions and ran two police blockades. During the chase shots were fired, nearly missing a group of children at a school crossing. The inmate was taken into custody after running the car into a ditch.
As patient treatment was updated , so were the facilities. Older buildings were razed in the '60s and '70s and two new buildings were constructed -- a 511-bed medical hospital in 1962 and a long term care facility in 1974. The Walter Reuther Long Term Care Facility housed the surviving mentally ill and poor who had made Eloise their permanent home.
By 1987, six years after the facility's closing, Eloise had been reduced to eight buildings. Today, only a 5 buildings remain and all are empty. The county is currently working on a plan to redevelop the complex. The ""D"" building houses some Wayne County of [1]In November 2015, the Detroit Free Press reported that the 50-acre complex was put on sale for $1.5 million – which includes an fire station from the 1800s, a decommissioned power plant and two maintenance buildings. On March 29th, 2016 the former bakery building built in 1905, one of the last original buildings, was the victim of arson. The damage was enough to have the structure demolished. Morgan Development purchased the property in June of 2018.

New York,Yates County Poorhouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Yates_County_Poorhouse,1830,,,Demolished,,,,"In 1824 the State Legislature passed an act which made a general provision for the maintenance of the poor of the several counties of the State and under this law the supervisors of the county took the initial steps toward the establishment of a county infirmary. The matter was under discussion early in October 1829 at which time the supervisors filed with the clerk a certificate that read as follows: ""In compliance with the tenth section of an act passed the 27th of November, 1824, relative to County Poor-Houses, we hereby determine that it will benefit the county of Yates to erect a county poor-house therein. ""Given under our hands this 10th day of October, 1829. ""Jonathan Whittaker, George Youngs, Clarkson Martin, Alfred Brown, Asher Spicer, James Christie, Abraham Maxfield."" Thereafter the supervisors of the county agreed upon the purchase of lands for poor house purposes. The deed was executed on April 14, 1830, by Alfred Brown of Jerusalem, to the superintendents of the poor of Yates County, Elijah Spencer, Joel Dorman, Jabez French, John Warner, and James C. Robinson, whereby in consideration of the sum of $1,200 the grantor conveyed to the grantees, or their successors in office or legal representatives, 125 acres of land in the town of Jerusalem. This is the same tract of land now in part used by the county as a poor house farm. The Yates County poor house and its management have at times been the subjects of much discussion and no little anxiety on the part of the supervisors, the press, and the people of the county as well. There have been charges of corruption and extravagance which may not have been wholly groundless. It was during the period extending from 1855 to 1860 that the subject was uppermost in the public and official mind, but eventually, the matter was adjusted or settled and affairs resumed their usual quiet state. From that to the present time there has been no serious disturbance concerning the county's poor house management.[1][2]

As of 1850, state law mandated that young men under the age of 16 could be committed to the W.H. of R. for vagrancy or a criminal conviction in a court located in Western New York. A 42-acre site was purchased for the institution in the city of Rochester for $4,200. It was located in the northwest section of the city, west of Lake Avenue at the junction of Phelps Avenue and Backus Street.
The Western House of Refuge opened on August 11, 1849 with room for 50 juveniles. The first building for the institution, commonly known as the main building, was constructed in 1847. It fronted east on Backus Street (which incidentally was named after Dr. Frederick F. Backus, who was a physician and a manager at the W.H. of R.). Additions were added on to the main building in 1851 and 1855, bringing the capacity to 400 inmates just six years after the institution opened. Several other additions and buildings would later be added to the site, including two workshops in the 1860s.
In 1875 it was ruled that girls under the age of 16 would also be sent to the Western House of Refuge. The first girls were admitted on October 3, 1876. Prominent local architect A.J. Warner erected a building for the girls’ department circa 1879. However, this structure was destroyed by fire and a new building, sometimes called the South Building, was constructed in 1888. The fortieth annual report (1889) declared that ""the new girls’ building is a beautiful edifice having a frontage of 276 feet on Backus [Street]. The central part of the building is four stories in height, and the wings three stories."" The Western House of Refuge continually expanded through the years: in terms of its facilities, its policies of reform and its number of ""inmates.""
A new hospital building was built for the institution around 1889, replacing an earlier structure. A laundry building followed in 1892. The inmates performed much of the construction work on the facility’s buildings throughout the years. A large drill hall (with a floor space of 100 x 290 feet) was built in 1892. The boys were trained as military cadets under a strict regimen of physical exercise and training in the drill hall. Also, the hall served as an open recreation area during periods of inclement weather. A guardhouse was constructed around 1893. This building featured a long hallway and several small rooms that were to be used for solitary confinement. In 1897 the south wing of the main building was removed to make way for a new chapel building, which would be able to accommodate 900 people. Other buildings which occupied the grounds included workshops, a bathroom building (with classroom space on the second story), a boiler-house and electric plant, a greenhouse and a dining/kitchen building. Parts of the yard were used for farming. On the whole, it was a self-sustaining facility.
The Western House of Refuge was originally much like a child’s prison. Although it was called a reformatory, the punitive aspect was much more dominant than the reform aspect. The institution operated under a system of contract labor whereby the inmates did the work for outside companies (such as buggy whip manufacturers and furniture makers) and the earnings of the inmates went towards the cost of the institution. The boys worked all-day and attended unorganized school sessions in the evenings. Inmates were grouped together until 1869 when it was decided to form separate divisions; one for the younger boys and one for the older boys. This division was made upon the assumption that the older boys were naturally more criminal and the younger boys should be somewhat sheltered from the bad influence of the older boys. A stone wall was built through the middle of the yard in 1869 to keep the divisions apart.
In 1884 the Western House of Refuge underwent an investigation by the New York State Assembly. The Assembly’s probe criticized the harsh corporal punishments, the contract labor system, the lack of schooling and the deficiency of proper classification for inmates. This investigation proved to be the catalyst for a number of reforms. Contract labor was immediately abolished and corporal punishment was done away with by 1893. The school system was graded like regular public schools and the boys were further classified by their character and behavior. The biggest change came in 1886 when the institution changed its name from the Western House of Refuge to the State Industrial School. Schools of technology were introduced with the idea that the best way for the youngsters to combat lives of crime was to teach them a skilled trade (like carpentry) in combination with reading, writing and arithmetic.
Other changes were put in place as well to make the institution less forbidding. Narrow bar-covered windows were replaced by larger windows, which let in more natural light. Heavy iron doors were removed. Open dormitories replaced the separate cell-like sleeping quarters. These alterations were designed to create an atmosphere more conducive to rehabilitation. Despite all the changes that had been made to the facilities (including the reconstruction of the main building after a fire in 1887) it was decided that a new environment was needed. In 1902 one thousand acres of land were purchased in the Town of Rush and it was decided to move the institution out ""to the country."" The name was consequently changed to the State Agricultural and Industrial School. The move to Rush began in 1902. In 1904 the girls’ department was eliminated. By 1907 the move was complete and the site in the city was abandoned. It was purchased by the city of Rochester, who transformed it into Exposition Park in 1911. Some of the buildings on the grounds were demolished (including the perimeter wall) while some of the others were transformed for re-use in the park.
Exposition Park became the site for the Rochester Exposition, an annual Chamber of Commerce event that promoted the city. Many of the old school buildings were permanently used by the Exposition. The chapel became the assembly hall, the drill hall became the exhibition building and the girls’ department building became the library and museum. New structures were built on the site as well, including a bandstand, the peristyle, grandstands and Jefferson Junior High School. In 1922 the park was renamed Edgerton Park after Rochester mayor Hiram Edgerton. Most of the structures in the park were razed in 1947, as the grounds were no longer used for the expositions. However, some structures, such as Jefferson, remain on the site. The last surviving building from the days of the old State Industrial School, though, is the former chapel building. It is currently (in 2002) the Edgerton Recreation Center at 41 Backus Street.
Today the State Agricultural and Industrial School at Industry is a limited security facility for thirteen to sixteen year olds adjudicated as juvenile delinquents by family courts.",,"Rush, NY (Second Location)",,

New York,Gabriels Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Gabriels_Sanatorium,,,1897,Closed,Cottage Plan,,,"Gabriels Sanitarium opened on July 16, 1897, for treatment of Tuberculosis invalids in the Adirondacks. It was named in honor of the Right Reverend Bishop Henry Gabriels who had urged the Sisters of Mercy to attempt the establishment of the much needed sanitarium. Sister Mary of the Perpetual Help Kiernan, of the Sisters of Mercy Order, used her untiring faith and energy to make her dream a reality. Sister Mary and her co-worker Sister McAuley lived in a log cabin with the gift of a donkey and cart for transportation. Within a few years, although they only had $15 from the Mother House and a lot of determination to work with, they acquired the site and several buildings.
Dr. Seward Webb and Mr. Paul Smith donated the first 100 acres of land and the State of New York followed with a grant of 600 additional acres. Many people gave generously and donations were used to support the property. Only those with at least moderately advanced cases of Tuberculosis were admitted as patients. When they entered, they were not only treated for Tuberculosis, but also were taught every detail of prevention so they might tell others and possibly prevent other cases from developing. Fifteen per cent of the patients were treated free of charge, a few paid the entire cost, and most patients paid less than the full cost of treatment. The average patient's length of stay was eight months.
The Sanitarium flourished through the hard work and dedication of its staff, and despite the destruction of several buildings due to fire over the course of its history. However, after World War II, the decline of Tuberculosis forced the Sanitarium staff to devote most of their facilities to geriatric patients. In the 68 years of the sanitarium's operation, over 5,500 patients were treated. Sixty-nine per cent of the patients benefited from treatment and a great number were able to return to their former lives.
After a series of unsuccessful fund drives and a re-evaluation of the Sanitarium's new nursing program, the Sisters decided to sell the property.  On August 15, 1965, Paul Smith's College purchased the Gabriels Sanitarium property for $150,000 as an extension center for their growing Forestry Program.
Gabriels housed the sophomore foresters enrolled in a block program for the fall term. Later classes were held there, as well, to avoid having to provide transportation to the main campus. Classes were taught in the basement of Rest-a-While Cottage, while the Butler Building served as classrooms and a cafeteria. The Butler Building was built in the early 1970s as a gymnasium, but it was later used as a cafeteria and for additional classroom space.
By 1977, declining enrollment led to buildings deteriorating due to disuse, and the school started moving the different options of the Forestry Program back to the main campus. Finally only the forest technicians were at Gabriels. Also, in 1979-80 two new dormitories were constructed and opened to students, which provided additional space on campus so that only thirty-five students went to Gabriels to live for the last time. The Gabriels campus had become such a financial liability that the administration opened up two additional cottages on the main campus, Moffet and Walker, for the Spring semester to house the thirty-five remaining students. The fall term of 1980 was the last to see Paul Smith's students at the Gabriels campus. By this time, it was being used only as dormitory space— all classes and dining services were at the main campus.
The college then sold the facility to the State of New York to be used for a minimum security prison.  Camp Gabriels received its first draft of inmates on August 30, 1982. These residents were transferred to Camp Gabriels from the Adirondack Correctional Facility, which had been upgraded from a Camp to a Medium Security Facility. The first group of twenty-five inmates was selected because of their building skills. These men were all housed on one floor in the first housing unit and proceeded to refurbish the second floor and the other housing unit areas in a systematic fashion. As additional housing areas were reconstructed, more inmates were received at the facility.
The Camp's maximum capacity was initially designated at 149. A year later in the Fall of 1983, the Camp experienced a modest increase; the capacity was increased from 149 to 166. The next expansion occurred two years after the Camp's inception. In August of 1984, the capacity was increased to 201 beds. In July of 1987, the population increased to 251 due to the Shock Incarceration Program at other Camps.  During 1991, budgetary constraints caused a loss of ENCON personnel associated with Correctional Camps. The former ENCON Crews were changed to Community Service Crews. At present, Camp Gabriels has 15 Community Service Crews servicing communities, institutions, and non-profit organizations within a 50-mile radius of this facility.
The mission of Camp Gabriels was to continue to maintain a secure environment while building and to foster positive programming for inmates, with cooperative service to the Community. Camp Gabriels was closed by New York State in 2009. It has been for sale by the state since then. Despite at least two announced auction dates, it has not sold.",,"Gabriels, NY",,

New York,Jackson Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jackson_Sanitarium,,1854,1854,Closed,Single Building,Nathaniel Bingham / A.J. Warner,Jackson Health Resort | Our Home on the Hillside | Physical Culture Hotel | Bernarr Macfadden Hotel and Health Resort,"Construction of the Jackson Sanatorium began in 1854 by Nathaniel Bingham, who chose the location due to the sulfur rich springs that ran through the area in New York. When Bingham fell ill, Dr. James Caleb Jackson, a prominent doctor and survivor of childhood illness took over the project. Construction was completed later that year, and the facility opened as Jackson's ""Home on the Hillside."" The sanitarium served as a retreat and healing center, spreading Jackson's idea of health through hydrotherapy and a diet with minimal meat consumption and heavy in fruits, vegetables, and grains. The doctor provided patients with an unprocessed grain source in the form of a bland, supplement made of bran and graham flour. The supplement, called granula by Jackson, was made chewable by soaking in water overnight and provided nutrition for patients of the resort.
In 1887, John Kellog, one of Jackson's colleagues, created a similar supplement, a biscuit made of whole grains like oats, wheat and corn meal. He called the product Biscuit Granula, and Jackson sought legal action against him for copyright infringement of the name. The case was settled, with Kellog adopting the name Granola. [1]
Jackson sanitarium featured other healing methods that were popular at that time, including maximum sunlight and fresh air. Each room had tall ceilings and windows placed to maximize air circulation. The roof of the building included rounded wood platforms enclosed in glass, allowing patients to be exposed to sunlight and fresh air.
After the Civil War, the facility served as a resort for wealthy people looking to be healed of physical and mental ailments. The doctor's ideas of natural healing were carried on at the facility. In the 1870's the aging Dr. Jackson handed over the care of the facility to his son and daughter in law ( Drs. James H. and Kate J. Jackson)[2], but in June of 1882, a fire broke out in the main building. A new five-story building was constructed by A.J. Warner, which opened on October 1st 1883. [3] After several decades of success, use of the facility began to slow. By 1914, the couple declared bankruptcy and Jackson Sanitarium closed its doors.
The building functioned as a psychiatric hospital for the Army for the treatment of soldiers from World War I, but soon closed again. Several failed attempts to reopen the facility failed in the following years.
In the spring of 1929, Bernarr Mcfadden, an entrepreneur and heath and fitness guru, purchased and opened the resort as the Physical Culture Hotel. The name came from Mcfadden's successful magazine, called Physical Culture, and was one of several resorts that he owned. The old building was refurbished and soon became successful as a hotel with a focus in fitness and healing. Celebrities used to hotel as a get-away, retreating to the open-air facility and participating in activities like swimming, tennis, and having exclusive parties with music.
Mcfadden died in 1955 at the age of 87. Ownership of the hotel was passed to William Fromcheck, who kept the name of Bernarr Mcfadden's Castle on the Hill. Guest numbers decreased significantly, and the hotel never reopened after it closed for the season in 1971.
The sanatorium remains vacant now, 100 years later. In January 2008, the New York State Restore Communities Initiative allotted $2.5 million for restoration of the building. [4]

New York,Iola Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Iola_Sanatorium,1909,,1911,Demolished,Cottage Plan,Charles F. Crandall,Monroe County Tuberculosis Sanatorium,"In Monroe County the growing number of tuberculosis cases at the local hospitals during the first decade of the twentieth century led to the effort by the County Board of Supervisors to establish a sanatorium for tuberculosis treatment. The Board of Supervisors engaged in a protracted debate to determine whether the facility should be operated by the County or the City of Rochester.
After that issue was resolved, the County’s Public Buildings Commission undertook a survey of sixty-two potential sites. Despite opposition from some of the Town of Brighton community, use of the Westfall Road site was initiated in 1909 when a tent was erected to temporarily house a handful of patients. Through the winter of that year the tent was heated by kerosene burners. The following spring a portable house was erected on the site.
In 1914 school classes were begun on the campus. Classes were originally held in two tents furnished by Mr. and Mrs. Williams Bausch. Four years later, the campus underwent a major expansion. The three-story Infirmary was built near the center of the site and increased the sanatorium’s capacity to 200 patients. At the same time, a service wing was added to the north side of the administration building to provide kitchen and dining facilities. A short time later, a large one-story surgical wing was added to the north side of the infirmary. The growing number of tuberculosis cases required continued expansion of the sanatorium. By the mid 1920s the facility was treating nearly 600 patients a year.
As the facility grew the original leach field was replaced by a small waste water treatment plant, located on county land south of the complex, just north of the Erie Canal. The now demolished sewage plant was expanded over the years to serve the expanding sanatorium and the new Monroe County Community Hospital constructed across the street. A steam power plant was built in conjunction with the hospital. The power plant is linked to the buildings of the Iola complex as well as the Monroe County Community Hospital complex by an extensive system of concrete utility tunnels. Small flat-roof ventilators, serving the tunnels, are scattered around the complex grounds.
In 1928 a four-story medical wing including x-ray facilities was added to the infirmary. In the late 1920s, with over 400 patients, the Iola Sanatorium was the largest county tuberculosis facility in New York State. A debate over the future use of the facility began in the Monroe County Board of Supervisors before the tuberculosis facility closed its doors in 1964. Beginning in the mid 1960s, most of the existing buildings on the site were converted to office space and storage areas for county departments. The less easily adaptable administration and infirmary buildings were left vacant. Early in the 1970s the County began to develop the southern undeveloped portion of the property. The first building constructed was the Children’s Detention Center located at the base of the slope just east of the former Children’s Building.
During the 1980s several large public works buildings, including the Pure Waters Operations and Storage Facility and the County Fleet Maintenance Garage were built on the site of the former waste water treatment facility. In 1975 the Administration Building was demolished and the area it occupied was converted to parking serving the county offices located in the former Children’s Building. The Infirmary was demolished in 1982. In 1999 Monroe County, citing high maintenance costs and the desire to consolidate county offices, relocated the county departments housed at the site to leased space in downtown Rochester. [1]
The remaining buildings on the property were demolished in the summer of 2013.",1964,"Rochester, NY",Georgian Revival,

New York,Seaview Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=New_York_City_Farm_Colony,1837,,1913 (As a Sanatorium),Active,Pavilion Plan,Raymond Almilrall,Richmond County Poor Farm | New York City Farm Colony | Sea View Hospital | Sea View Hospital and Rehabilitation Center and Home,"The Richmond County Poor Farm was established in the 1830's after the city acquired a 91 acre area called Stephen Marine farm.  Over the next few years a cholera hospital and insane asylum were built along with housing for the poor.  The residents worked on the farm in exchange for food and housing.
In 1902 the name of the farm was changed to the New York City Farm Colony.  At this time the farm contained sixteen buildings, including dormitories, a dining and kitchen building, laundry and industrial building, shops, nurses residence and a morgue among others.  The area also contained the Staten Island Potters Field and it was used as a cemetery until 1905.
Across the street from the Farm a 25 acre estate of Charles Schmidt known as Ocean View became the proposed location of a tuberculosis hospital in 1905. Seaview Hospital was opened on November 12, 1913 at this location.
The Farm merged with Seaview Hospital in 1915 and the entire area was renamed Seaview Farm, till 1921 when the merger ended.

New York,Onondaga County Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Onondaga_County_Sanatorium,1909,1913,1916,Demolished,Single Building,,Onondaga Sanatorium,"It was not until 1900 that an infirmary for the segregation of physically ill persons was constructed and in 1916 the Onondaga County Tuberculosis Sanatorium was opened. By 1945 the infirmary had more patients than any other medical facility in the County and the Welfare Department was swamped with admission applications.
By that time, there were 254 beds for patients requiring acute care, a maternity ward, 150 beds for the disabled requiring less care and 400 ‘inmates’ of the county home in facilities scattered across Onondaga Hill. In 1948, the County turned the Tuberculosis Sanatorium over to the New York State Department of Health who finally closed the sanatorium in 1959 as medical treatment modalities no longer called for such a facility. A part of the former sanatorium grounds was deeded to the Community General Hospital of Greater Syracuse.
In the 1950s the services of the County Home were reorganized as the hospital care system in the community evolved. In 1962 the County Home farm campus was abandoned and other County departments took over some of the property, including the Onondaga Community College and Hillbrook Detention Center. Other residential programs remained in operation. Medicare and Medicaid were passed in 1965, marking a major shift in America’s philosophy and financing for the care of the aged and disabled. Onondaga County responded to this change and to the growing need for care for the elderly and began construction of the new (current) Van Duyn Home and Hospital in 1975.
The stairs to the Onondaga County Sanatorium start at the south corner of St. Agnes Cemetery going up the hill to what is now a Nursing home and private doctors office on Broad Rd, Seneca Turnpike next to the Syracuse Community General Hospital.   Only a few stairs and an archway announcing the Sanatorium exist.",1959,"Syracuse, NY",,

New York,Rainbow Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rainbow_Sanatorium,,,"July 20th, 1910",Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Lake Rainbow Sanatorium,"On July 20th, 1910, the Rainbow Sanatorium was opened by the Independent Order of the Fosters on 600 acres of land in New York. The property, built on the shore of Rainbow Lake, was formerly run as the Rainbow Inn. The sanatorium consisted of eight buildings in total, including the original inn. The main building was powered with steam heat and electricity and was one eighth of a mile from New York Central's Rainbow Station. The property included dairy and hog barns, an ice house, a carriage house that stored the farm equipment, and porches on the main building to allow patients for fresh air. The main hotel building had 30 rooms for housing patients, and a second annex had another 20 rooms.
The physician appointed to look after the patients, Dr. Whipple, of Malone, also served as the first superintendent of the sanatorium. In the first year of operation, 102 patients were admitted.
After World War I, having a shortage of member patients, Rainbow accepted as many as 65 tubercular veterans as patients. When they had been in operation for ten years, a report showed that they had admitted 642 patients, 102 the first year, and fewer than seventy in succeeding years until 1919 and 1920, when 192 were admitted.
A medical report from 1921 states, ""Since the Sanatorium opened 611 patients have been treated and discharged. Of these, 3 were extra-pulmonary and 14 non-tubercular, leaving 594 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Of these, nearly 100 per cent of the incipient cases were cured, had their disease arrested, or were improved. Only one case out of the 120 failed to improve, and this was distinctly the patient's fault.""
The report calls tuberculosis ""a rich man's disease, but the poor man has it. It is a disease which cannot be fought off by will power and physical activity.""
In 1930, the  institution was closed and the remaining patients were moved to the Forester's Sanatorium in California. The land was divided among several purchasers, and the sanatorium and the old Inn were razed.[1]

Over the next few years a cholera hospital and insane asylum were built along with housing for the poor.  The residents worked on the farm in exchange for food and housing.
In 1902 the name of the farm was changed to the New York City Farm Colony.  At this time the farm contained sixteen buildings, including dormitories, a dining and kitchen building, laundry and industrial building, shops, nurses residence and a morgue among others.  The area also contained the Staten Island Potters Field and it was used as a cemetery until 1905.
Across the street from the Farm a 25 acre estate of Charles Schmidt known as Ocean View became the proposed location of a tuberculosis hospital in 1905. Seaview Hospital was opened on November 12, 1913 at this location.
The Farm merged with Seaview Hospital in 1915 and the entire area was renamed Seaview Farm, till 1921 when the merger ended.

New York,Summit Park Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Summit_Park_Sanatorium,,,1918/1937,Preserved,Single Building,,Rockland County Infirmary | Summit Park Hospital,"The Summit Park Sanatorium was erected in 1918 after a popular vote for its construction was taken by the citizens of Rockland County, and in accordance with Section 45 of the County Law, which provided that counties with a population of 35,000 or more must establish and maintain a county hospital for the care and treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis. This building was located on the grounds where Building L is located today.
The sanatorium, a two-story frame structure with open, unheated porches, was equipped to accommodate forty-six patients, although within a few years the hospital maintained a daily average of fifty-five patients. The first patient was admitted on October 14, 1919. Steady growth of the Institution necessitated provisions for a nurses' home, employees' quarters, Recreational Hall and Occupational Therapy Shop, and a Superintendent's residence. To meet those needs, two additional buildings were constructed in 1925.
The progress made in the treatment of tuberculosis in the early 20th century was unparalleled. Treatment had previously consisted of climatic changes and fresh air with little regard to rest or the comfort of the patient. With the extensive use of surgery in the treatment of tuberculosis, the Summit Park Sanatorium was considered a modern hospital, and was equipped with X-rays, clinical laboratories, operating room facilities, and comfortably heated rooms.
By the early 1930's, the building required significant reconstruction, but after careful study, this was found impossible. Furthermore, the State no longer approved of extensive remodeling of any hospital building whose construction was known to be a fire hazard. In the Fall of 1935, Rockland County obtained an outright grant of $204,952.00 from the Federal Government which was matched by $250,000.00 by the County, or a total appropriation of $454,952.00 for construction, sewerage, and complete equipment for a ""new"" Summit Park. Ground was broken on March 5, 1936 and construction began in May 1936. The work progressed rapidly, and the building was occupied on May 26, 1937. The new Summit Park Sanatorium was considered one of the finest institutions in the country. It was fireproof, tastefully furnished, and completely equipped with all the latest therapeutic facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases.
Dr. Robert L. Yeager was named Superintendent and Medical Director of Summit Park Sanatorium in 1942 and during his tenure was a leading force in the growth of what is now known as The Dr. Robert L. Yeager Health Center.  In the mid-1960's, Dr. Yeager took the lead along with two other county agencies, Department of Health and Department of Mental Health, in a monumental project that would bring together the three agencies to one health complex. He was named Director of the Department of Health and Hospitals in 1974.
In October of 1977, Summit Park Hospital along with the Rockland County Infirmary nursing home in Building C, relocated to Building A of the 110-acre campus. The Summit Park Sanatorium (Building L), was converted to office space and currently houses the Department of Social Services.
Dr. Yeager retired in 1980 after 42 years of unparalleled service to the county.  In 1987, the Rockland County Health Center was officially changed to The Dr. Robert L. Yeager Health Center.  Dr. Yeager was known to be ""tough minded"" but soft spoken and kept a low profile.  He opposed having the complex named after him and at the dedication ceremony is quoted as saying the following, ""In principle, that one person should be honored above so many others is embarrassing.""
Dr. Yeager was succeeded after his retirement by James M. Jones, MPH, a native of Haverstraw, NY.   Jones was named Rockland County's first Commissioner of Health and Hospitals.
Summit Park Hospital was named an LTACH (long-term acute care hospital) in the 1990's, and today it is the only Long Term Acute Care Hospital in Rockland, Orange and Westchester Counties.
The Almshouse had been vacated in 1957, when residents were moved to the renamed Rockland County Infirmary and Home at Summit Park. The original welfare home was a frame structure built in 1837, the year the 47-acre parsonage farm property was bought for that purpose by the county Commissioners of the Poor from the Dutch Reformed Church of West New Hempstead.
The frame edifice was replaced in 1883 by the first of three sections constructed of brick from the thriving Haverstraw brickyards. The south section came later, followed by the connecting west wing to form the current ""U"" shape. The building was demolished to make room for the new Rockland Community College in 1959.",1977,,,
New York,Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Triboro_Hospital_for_Tuberculosis,1903,,1916,Closed,Single Building,,Triboro Tuberculosis Hospital | Triboro Hospital | Queens Hospital Center | Queens Hospital | Queensboro Hospital for Contagious Diseases | Queensboro Hospital | Queensboro Pavilion,"With the need for more facilities to deal with tuberculosis raging through New York, the city bought the twenty-two-acre Haack farm in 1903. The Queensboro Hospital for Contagious Diseases would later open on the property on June 29, 1916. Adjacent to the property, on October 30, 1935, the Queens General Hospital would open. Barely a year later the old TB complex was merged into the regular hospital.
In 1936, the city began construction on a new tuberculosis hospital near the Queens hospital and pavilion. With the use of Public Works Administration funds, ground broke for the new building in 1938 and opened in 1941. Patients were moved into the new institution from the surrounding hospitals.
Throughout the 50s and 60s, Triboro took in TB patients from other surrounding institutions as those places closed due to the declining need for tuberculosis focused hospitals. By 1959, the hospital boards of Queens General and Triboro Hospital were combined completing the merger of the hospitals. Finally, in 1970, Triboro shifted into a normal hospital within the Queens Hospital complex.
However, by the early seventies, the entire complex, both earlier TB and General Hospital buildings, were considered below health standards. The structures were antiquated, and the institution underfunded and underequipped. A proposal to move the institution and close the complex, however, was shut down due to community opposition and a city financial crisis.
By the late 80s, many of the older 30s PWA buildings were torn down for more modern buildings. However, the original Triboro TB building built in 1937 was saved and renovated. It then operated as a drug treatment facility with a psychiatric unit on its third floor.
However, the old TB building continued to deteriorate causing the city to relocate its services to other buildings. Due to its historic status, the city and surrounding communities chose to save the structure and turn it into affordable housing. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by New York State in 2018. This allowed for tax credits and redevelopment funds for the creation and retention of 13 affordable housing developments.",2000,,,
New York,Trudeau Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Trudeau_Sanatorium,1884,,1885,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium,"The Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium was a tuberculosis sanatorium established in Saranac Lake in 1884 by Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau. After Trudeau's death in 1915, the institution's name was changed to the Trudeau Sanatorium, following changes in conventional usage.
Trudeau was born in 1848 in New York City to a family of physicians. During his late teens, his elder brother James contracted tuberculosis and Edward nursed him until his death three months later. At twenty, he enrolled in the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University (then Columbia College), completing his medical training in 1871. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1873. Following conventional thinking of the times, he went to live in the Adirondacks, seeking a change of climate. He spent as much time as possible in the open and subsequently regained his health. In 1876 he moved to Saranac Lake for the winter and established a small medical practice.
In 1882, Trudeau read about Prussian Dr. Hermann Brehmer's success treating tuberculosis with the ""rest cure"" in cold, clear mountain air. Following this example, Trudeau founded the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium in February, 1885. The first patients were two sisters who had been factory workers in New York City. They were treated in a one-room cottage named ""Little Red"", built for $350 on land donated by the guides and residents of the village. As the sanitarium grew, it would be supported at first by wealthy sportsmen that Trudeau had met at nearby Paul Smith's Hotel, several of whom had built great camps on the nearby St. Regis Lakes. Early contributors included John W. Minturn, Anson Phelps Stokes, and Whitelaw Reid.
While the sanitarium did not offer its services free-of-charge, it treated poorer patients at less than cost, and fund-raising was a constant concern. Many physicians and staff members served without pay, and in later years Trudeau commented that he had never been able to pay his staff adequately. Like Trudeau himself, a number of physicians and nurses were themselves infected with tuberculosis. Trudeau admitted mainly patients whose disease was not far advanced. From 1917-1936, 174 people died at the Sanatorium.
The sanitarium also developed a school for nursing, and later the Trudeau School of Tuberculosis, which offered six-week summer courses for physicians who wished to learn the latest treatment methods for the disease.
In time, far more patients would be drawn to the area than the sanitarium could handle. Many patients were treated in the small, often family-run, cure cottages that developed in the area to meet the demand. Large sanatoria were built at Ray Brook and Gabriels, and in 1927, the Will Rogers Hospital, the last of the institutional sanatoria, was built in Saranac Lake; it is now an assisted living facility, Saranac Village at Will Rogers.
The Trudeau Sanatorium closed on December 1, 1954, after the discovery of effective antibiotic treatments for tuberculosis. The property was sold by Trudeau's grandson, Dr. Francis B. Trudeau, Jr., to the American Management Association in 1957. The proceeds were invested in a new medical research facility, the Trudeau Institute, built on Lower Saranac Lake, which opened in 1964; subsequently Little Red and the Trudeau statue were moved to the new site as memorials. A number of the sanatorium buildings have been torn down, and many more have been badly renovated, but a substantial number are still intact. They are not generally open to the public, but tours are offered periodically by Historic Saranac Lake. [1]",1954,"Saranac Lake, NY",,

In the nineteenth century, the United States had suffered three devastating cholera outbreaks, with each originating abroad. As Ellis Island being the port of entry, it's two story wooden dispensary was not equipped to handle such threats. For the next decade the issue of how to protect the health of the nation and the immigrants loomed over Ellis. The problem would only intensify when the wooden infirmary caught fire and burned to the ground in 1897.
President Theodore Roosevelt proposed a change in immigration policy and recognized that Ellis Island needed a more thorough way to process it's health screening. There was no extra vacant land to build a hospital, but tons of rocks being excavated to build the New York subway system provided enough to landfill two islands. Designated simply as Island No. 2 and Island No. 3, they were home to the general and infectious diseases hospitals.
Connected by a gangplank, Island No. 2 was separated by 200 feet of water from the original island and home to the new General Hospital. It opened in 1902, with 120 beds making it larger then most of the city hospitals at the time, and would eventually expand to 275 beds. The hospital included four operating rooms, a delivery room, and a morgue. A psychopathic pavilion was built after two mentally ill patients committed suicide in the general hospital. The pavilion was incorporated to house ""idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, insane persons, and epileptics.""
The Contagious Disease Hospital, located on Island No. 3 and more than 400 feet from the main island opened in 1911. The hospital had eighteen wards, each built to house patients with a particular disease. There were separate wards for whooping cough, measles, scarlet fever, favus, and diphtheria, and two wards each for trachoma and tuberculosis. The hospital also had it's own laundry, mattress autoclave that could sterilize entire beds, an eight-cadaver refrigerator, an autopsy amphitheater, and a laboratory.
Ellis Island remained open and served many purposes. During WWII it primarily served as a detention center with approximately 7000 aliens and citizens detained by 1946. When the last detainee was released in November of 1956, Ellis Island officially closed.
In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson declared Ellis Island part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Ellis Island was opened to the public on a limited basis between 1976 and 1984. Starting in 1984, Ellis Island’s Main Building, Railroad Ticket Office and adjacent buildings underwent a major restoration.. The $160 million was reopened to the public on September 10, 1990 as the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. Today, the museum receives almost 2 million annually. [1]

The following year it was established as the City's public cemetery for the burial of those persons who died indigent or whose bodies went unclaimed. In the first year, 1,875 burials were performed.
In 1865, as the Civil War was ending, the Federal government used the Island as a prison camp for Confederate soldiers. During a yellow fever epidemic in 1870, a part of the Island was used to house persons confined to isolation. In the later part of the 19th century the Island was home to a charity hospital for women, an insane asylum, and a jail for prisoners who worked on the Potter's Field burial detail.
In the early 1900s, the Island housed an old men's home and a tuberculosis hospital for women. In 1904, a reformatory for male misdemeanants 16 - 30 years old was opened. When reformatory prisoners were transferred to another facility in 1914, the jail was used to house aged male prisoners and overflow from other City jails.
During WWII, the Island was turned over to the Navy for use as a disciplinary barracks for Navy, Coast Guard and Marine personnel, with as many as 2,800 servicemen in custody. In fact, probably the closest WWII ever got to the shores of America came when three German soldiers surfaced in a U-Boat near Long Island. They were taken into custody and imprisoned for a time on Hart Island.
Hart Island was returned to the Correction Department in 1946 and the jail was reactivated. In the 1940s, inmates on Hart Island appealed to the warden and offered to build a monument to the unbefriended dead. This was accomplished in 1948 when, in cooperation with the custodial staff, they erected a 30-foot high monument in the center of the burial site. On one side is engraved a simple cross; on the other the word ""Peace.""
In 1950, the Island was released to the Department of Welfare for housing of male derelicts. Because of a rising prisoner population, the Island was again returned to the Correction Department in 1954 for use as a jail. From 1955 to 1961, the U.S. Army maintained a NIKE missile base on a ten-acre area of the Island.
In 1966, the jail was closed and the Island was used as a center for the Phoenix House narcotic rehabilitation program. This program was discontinued in 1976 and the Island returned to the Correction Department. However, the Department did not operate the Island as a jail until 1982, when a small prisoner contingent was again housed there. In 1991, the inmates housed on Hart Island were transferred to Rikers Island.
Today, the inmate work details are bused from Rikers Island during the week to perform the burials, disinterments and maintenance of the Island. Since the start in 1869, more than 750,000 burials (estimate) have been performed.",,"New york, NY",,
