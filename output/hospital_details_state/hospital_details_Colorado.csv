Colorado,Colorado Psychiatric Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Colorado_Psychiatric_Hospital,1919,,1925,Active,Single Building,,Colorado Psychopathic Hospital,"In 1919 the State Legislature established the University of Colorado Health Science Center and authorized the construction of the Colorado Psychiatric Hospital. In 1923 the psychiatry training program in psychiatry was created by an act of the Colorado Legislature to ""train physicians in the art and science of neuropsychiatry and to treat citizens who suffer from mental disease"".
The Colorado Psychiatric Hospital was created in 1919 in order to serve as the laboratory for the study, research and treatment of psychopathology. The chairman of the Department of Psychiatry served as superintendent for the Colorado Psychiatric Hospital (CPH). Seventy-three years later, on July 1, 2002, the Colorado Psychiatric Hospital formally became part of the University of Colorado Hospital.
When the Colorado Psychiatric Hospital opened in 1925, it offered one of the first psychiatric residency programs in the United States with a planned curriculum of formal courses and supervised clinical assignments. Over twenty chairman of departments of psychiatry, four presidents of the American Psychiatric Association, and two directors of the National Institute of Mental Health have come from the University of Colorado Program.
As one of the largest departments of psychiatry in the United States, there are now over 150 regular faculty and more than 300 clinical faculty members. The department maintains training programs in psychiatry, psychology, and social work at the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. Dr. Robert Freedman has led the department of psychiatry as chairman since December of 2000. His professional experience includes research in the molecular neurobiology of schizophrenia, clinical practice, and the editorship of the American Journal of Psychiatry.[1]",,"Denver, CO",,
Colorado,Colorado State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Colorado_State_Hospital,1877,,1879,Active,Cottage Plan,,Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo | Colorado State Insane Asylum,"The Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo opened as the Colorado State Insane Asylum on October 23, 1879 on 40 acres of land in northwest Pueblo donated by George M. Chilcott, Colorado's first United States senator. On that date, 11 patients were admitted, nine males and two females from 12 different counties of the state. In 1917, the insane asylum was renamed the Colorado State Hospital. By 1923, the census the hospital climbed to 2,422 and continued to grow until 1961 when the hospital had nearly 6,000 patients. Like many state psychiatric hospitals at that time, it was a self-contained city, providing all the patients' needs within 300 acres of land on the main grounds and 5,000 acres at the dairy farm.
By 2005, however, the patient census declined to less than 450 patients, a result of the development of medications specifically for mental disorders, and a change in the philosophy and treatment of the mentally ill. The sign at the entrance still reads ""Colorado State Hospital"" although in 1991 the Colorado Department of Human Services psychiatric facilities names were changed to Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo and Colorado Mental Health Institute at Fort Logan.

New facilities for psychiatric inpatient and support services were built in the 1960s as a new era for the military post began.  Offices of the Colorado Department of Human Services and other service agencies also were located on the grounds.  The name changed in 1991 to Colorado Mental Health Institute at Fort Logan.

Colorado,Grand Junction Regional Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Grand_Junction_Regional_Center,,,1921,Active,Cottage Plan,,"Teller Institute | State Home for Mental Defectives, Grand Junction | State Home and Training School","The 160 acre parcel of land on which the Grand Junction Regional Center campus is located was formerly owned by the United States Government. In 1885, construction began on the Teller Institute, an Indian boarding school. By 1900, the school had an enrollment of about 200 students, including members of the Ute, Navajo, Papago, Moquis, Shoshone, and Pima tribes. With the Federal Government’s decision to return Native American students to their homes for their education, the Teller Institute was closed in July 1911. Shortly after that, its assets were liquidated, and it was discovered that groundwater was seeping into the basements of some buildings because of uncontrolled irrigation water. The buildings and land were given to the State of Colorado later that year.
After the buildings had been vacant for several years, the State opened a training school in 1921, known as the State Home for Mental Defectives, to serve “handicapped and retarded students.” The name was later changed to the State Home and Training School. By the 1960’s upwards of 800 people lived at the State Home, where some went to school and others worked on a dairy farm within the plot of land owned by the State. The name of the facility was changed to the Grand Junction Regional Center in the late 1970’s.
Ten community homes were built in the mid 1980's, each with the capability of serving eight people. With the national movement to return people with developmental disabilities to their communities and away from large, congregate settings, the number of people served on the Regional Center campus has gradually decreased. Another Personal Care Alternative (PCA) home was opened in the mid 1990's and two additional leased homes were opened in 2001.
Only three of the buildings on the campus that were built prior to 1911 remain standing. Over the years, the State of Colorado has erected other buildings, some of which have since been torn down, as well. In 1999, the State of Colorado deeded twenty-five acres of vacant land on the east side of the campus to the Department of Veterans Affairs to be used as a Veterans' cemetery. The new Veteran's Memorial Cemetery of Western Colorado was dedicated on July 17, 2002 and is now serving Colorado Veterans and their families.",,"Grand Junction, CO",,

The hospital served over 500 individuals with developmental disabilities and mental health diagnoses. In the 1980's progress was made to change the living arrangements, and the remaining 160 individuals were transferred to new residential home throughout the Pueblo West community. Today, PRC can serve up to 88 individuals with developmental disabilities until they can be stabilized and transitioned to a less restrictive setting the the community of their choice.",,"Pueblo, CO",,

When the facility was first opened there were 43 boys and 37 girls admitted with 80 technicians charged to care for them. There was a restriction that only children between five and fourteen could be admitted. During the 30's the institution grew to 200 with a waiting list of fifty.
In 1951 the census for WRRC grew to a population of 350, ranging from three months to 70 years of age. The administration of the school included a physical plant, farm and dairy with assets of $1,500,00.00. Ridge was no longer a ""retention home"" for the mentally retarded but was seen as a rehabilitation and training facility. Also during the 1950's the facility grew. There was actually a principal and 12 staff, including 2 speech therapist, 8 teachers, 1 recreational supervisor and an aide. A full maintenance department and many employees were needed to run the dairy and farm. Between 1957 - 1958, twelve individuals were discharged and 9 returned to community living with their families. Ridge also had several residents who had full or part time jobs in the community.
During the 60's and 70's the institution continued to grow and change. The census at the end of 1963 was 929. The agency had a barbershop, beauty shop, canteen and sewing room. Many community groups helped out so that the facility was able to raise money for camps and other needs.
In the 80's the philosophy of services for people with developmental disabilities had changed to looking at more community based services. Ridge was given funds to build 14 new group homes off the main campus in the community. Also, Ridge began to downsize it's population in the 80's and 90's. The downsizing was a direct link to many of the Community Center Boards offering smaller, more individualized settings for the developmentally disabled.",1991,"Arvada, CO",,

Colorado,Denver City and County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Denver_City_and_County_Farm,,,1898,Demolished,Single Building,,,"In 1898, the City of Denver purchased 350 acres of what is now the regional park to serve as an area to send indigent patients from Denver General hospital, creating what would become known as the Denver Poor Farm. Since no public welfare system existed until 1933, Denver officials used the Denver Poor Farm for five decades to relocate some of the city’s less fortunate residents. With a farm, infirmary and residential housing, the land was meant to help provide a place for individuals to work and improve their lives.
Despite those intentions, the Denver Poor Farm saw its fair share of troubles for decades, marked by unsanitary conditions, crime and a 1911 outbreak of tuberculosis. According to Albert Foos, a Brighton resident who grew up at the farm with his family, the Denver Poor Farm took a turn for the better when Harold Lascelles, a former agricultural extension agent, took over as farm superintendent in 1937. Lascelles helped transform the Denver Poor Farm into a self-sustaining and at times even profitable farm, which included cattle, pigs, chickens, gardens and one of the finest dairy herds in the state. Despite the turnaround, the Denver Poor Farm was finally dismantled in 1952, when Denver mayor J. Quigg Newton ordered its closure. The order was met with controversy, as local residents and politicians speculated its potential future and uses for helping community members in need. By 1959, the Denver Poor Farm was sold to Adams County under the conditions that it be used as a golf course, fairgrounds, race track and recreational park,",1952,"Henderson, CO",,

In December of that year, they purchased 195 acres, located in the Gypsum area, from Mary E. Hockett for $4,500. The action drew indignation from some sections of the county, but in 1901, Andrew Gerard won the poor farm contract and agreed to pay the county $350 per year to lease the property. In turn, the county paid him $4 per week for each resident on the farm. Three “wards” moved to the site and for the next 39 years, many county pioneers lived out their days at the farm.
By 1939, the federal government had enacted a system of care for the needy, old age pensions and Social Security. The Poor Farm, with only two wards in residence, was no longer needed.

Led by Matt France, commissioners purchased a small cottage on El Paso Street in August of 1880 to create a “county home” for the care of the sick and the poor. Despite reports in the local press to the contrary, need became so great that an addition to the home was built within a year. In 1886, they again expanded the facility when W.R. Roby built a two story addition with seven rooms. Still cramped and overcrowded, the facility was slated for demolition. In its place, commissioners planned to build a larger and more modern “County Home.”
After considerable negotiation, El Paso County Commissioners yielded and found a location far outside the boundaries of Colorado Springs. In May 1899, they purchased the 525 acre Liebig Ranch southwest of downtown near Bear Creek. Shortly after the home and hospital were opened, the facility burned to the ground during the night of January 20, 1900. Thankfully, patients and residents were unharmed, but they were displaced. Commissioners hurried to replace the building, and by October 10, 1900 the reportedly fire-proof $25,000 El Paso County Poor Farm opened.
When the El Paso County Poor Farm ceased operations in 1984, it was one of the last institutions of its kind in the country. The building was demolished, and is now the current site of Bear Creek Park and the Charmaine Nymann Community Gardens.",1984,"Colorado Springs, CO",,
