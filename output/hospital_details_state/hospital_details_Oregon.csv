The Mid-Columbia Home took over the facilities of the former Eastern Oregon Tuberculosis Hospital in The Dalles, Oregon. The Mid Columbia Home was established under Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 428 and was Oregon's first institution for the chronically ill and geriatric patients.
In 1961, the Mid-Columbia Home was renamed the Columbia Park State Home with the program still designed to help aged patients transferred from other state institutions. During this same year, the Legislative Assembly decided that all patients transferred to the Columbia Park State Home would come only from the Fairview Home. The Samuel May Building opened in 1963, doubling hospital capacity
In 1965, the Columbia Park State Home was renamed the Columbia Park Hospital and Training Center. Its role was changed from the care for the chronically ill and geriatric to the care of mentally retarded adults.
Due to the reduction of patients and a reduced need for the hospital care of the mentally retarded, the Columbia Park Hospital and Training Center was closed in 1977. The facility was sold to Judson Baptist College in the early 1980s. In 1993 it was sold to Columbia Gorge Community College.[1]",1977,"Dalles, OR",,

The functions of the hospital were to diagnose mental illness, provide treatment, and release patients who had satisfactorily responded to treatment; to investigate patients admitted and their family histories to determine the cause of a person's mental illness; to provide for humane custodial care to those for whom curative treatment was ineffective; to manage social and recreational programs for patients; to utilize patients for the maintenance and upkeep of buildings and grounds; and to assist in the protection of the patient's financial and business interests.
In 1965, the hospital became the Eastern Oregon Hospital and Training Center. In 1969, their goals were the restoration of patients to mental and physical health, economic self sufficiency, and if possible, the return of the patient to the community.
With a decline in the patient population, the 1983 Legislative Assembly authorized the establishment of a three hundred and fifty bed medium security prison at the Eastern Oregon Hospital and Training Center. The facility opened in 1985 as the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution.
On January 1, 1985, the Eastern Oregon Hospital and Training Center became the Eastern Oregon Psychiatric Center (EOPC) and the Eastern Oregon Training Center (EOTC). Both centers serve the sixteen central and eastern counties, with EOPC being a sixty bed inpatient facility for mentally and emotionally disturbed people. EOTC is a ninety bed training center for developmentally disabled residents.
The Department of Corrections currently uses the Kirkbride as part of it's 1600 bed prison. The Psychiatric Center uses a smaller building on the property.

Oregon,Oregon State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oregon_State_Hospital,1880,1881,1883,Preserved (Partially),Kirkbride Plan,Wilbur F. Boothby,Oregon State Insane Asylum,"As early as 1862 Governor Addison Gibbs recommended to the Oregon Legislature the establishment in Salem of an asylum to provide for the care and medical treatment of ""insane and idiotic persons"". Prior to the passage of any act dealing with the insane, each county had dealt with such unfortunate citizens on an individual basis. A document in the Oregon Archives offers an instance of this bidding procedure: dated August 6, 1845, William P. Dougherty of Oregon City awarded a contract for ""Boarding, clothing, and keeping"" Eli Smith, ""a lunatic,"" to Andrew Hembrie for $1.00 per day. Hembrie was under a $600 bond to fulfill the contract. Similar contracts could be found in each of the counties, usually under ""Pauper Accounts.""
By 1862, Dr. J. C. Hawthorne had opened his Portland Institute for the Insane. Marion County, along with most of the counties then in existence, contracted with Dr. Hawthorne to care for their citizens ""of unsound mind."" At county expense, these unfortunates were shipped to Portland.
Funds were allocated in the Fall of 1880 for the Oregon State Insane Asylum; the site selected was north of the state prison on a slight rise just east of Salem, its present location. Groundbreaking took place in May 1881 with much of the labor force and brick building material coming from the penitentiary.
Completed in the summer of 1883, the main building of the hospital (""J"" building) is a familiar sight to anyone traveling on Center Street east of downtown Salem. The street leading to the hospital was originally designated Asylum Avenue. To oversee the operations at the facility, Dr. Horace Carpenter, a local physician, was hired as the first Superintendent of the new facility, and the staff was engaged to serve the 412 patients the hospital could accommodate. In the Morning Oregonian appeared an account of the transfer of 261 male patients from Portland's Hawthorne Asylum to their new home in Salem. The reporter characterized these patients as ""representing almost every known stage or degree of insanity, idiocy, imbecility or helplessness"". (Actually, records indicate that 268 patients made the trip to Salem that day.) On October 24th, 1883, 102 female patients were transferred to Salem, including three girls, ages six to nine.
For three decades the facility operated as the Oregon State Insane Asylum. In 1913 the name change to Oregon State Hospital occurred. In this year also a crematory was put into use on the hospital grounds and all burials in the Asylum Cemetery were disinterred and cremated. Following the enactment of S. B. 109, deaths at ""any eleemosynary, penal, or corrective institution of the State of Oregon located at or near to the city of Salem,"" if unclaimed by a friend or relatives, would be subject to cremation. Their ashes now rest in the Memorial Circle on the western limits of the hospital grounds, ""In Memory of Those Who Have Passed Away at the Oregon State Hospital."" The incinerator, called ""Steiner's Chimney,"" (for then-superintendent Dr. Lee Steiner who had it built in 1910) can still be seen, though now the structure enclosing it houses the power plant.
The main hospital building (now called the ""J"" building) was originally designed according to Kirkbride’s specifications, but when it came time to add on additional wards, real estate issues prevented the wings from being extended in the normal fashion. Instead, they were extended back at a right angle to the original building’s main axis. An extension of the hospital’s north wing (""Cascade Hall"" or ""J"" building) in 1899 and the addition of seven separate buildings, including the familiar 1912 ""Dome Building"" where the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was filmed, in succeeding years reflect the growing realization that the mental health of Oregonians is a continuing concern.
There will be a new 620-bed mental health recovery center built on the existing site on Center Street NE. Construction is set to begin in the Spring of 2009 and finish in 2011. A 360-bed facility is proposed for Junction City. The cost of both new treatment centers is estimated to be 458 million dollars.
Salem’s facility is to serve the northwestern end of the State. It appears the area south of Center street where the historic J-building is located has been chosen for the new facility. A due diligence report indicates there are no “show stoppers” for that area. While nothing official has been said about tearing down the J-Building?, there is mention in the September OSH Replacement Project FAQ of the decrepit J-building and of “replacing a dilapidated hospital” and of the process for removal of lead-based paint and asbestos abatement (which would happen if the J-building were to be torn down.)
There has been talk of the structure not surviving an earthquake. Certainly, its use as a hospital is risky. But other historic brick buildings have been successfully retrofitted recently. One example is Waller Hall on the Willamette University campus. There have been 3 significant earthquakes in the greater Portland area. On July 24, 2008, Salem’s Historic Landmarks Commission will receive the request for demolition of portions of The J Building and other structures on the Oregon State Hospital campus. Some preservationists reluctantly approve of the proposed demolition plan. The demolition of these structures is necessary to create space for the new Oregon State Hospital. Preservationists succeeded in saving the oldest part of The J Building, dating from 1883, along with several of the historic homes and other important structures on the campus.
The part of The J Building slated to be preserved includes the original Kirkbride architectural philosophy. The preservation plans also call for recreating the original entry to the hospital, including the historic fountain, recently found in remarkably good condition in a hospital storage room. A new museum focusing on the history of mental health care in Oregon is also planned for the preserved building.
Demolition of any historic building is a sad event. However, it is necessary to sometimes say goodbye to parts of our past to make way for newer facilities, particularly when those new facilities will be designed to provide better care for our most vulnerable citizens. The State’s current plans graciously provide for the preservation of a significant part of the Kirkbride-inspired J Building along with honoring it further by designating part of it as a museum.
In addition, the Oregon Department of Human Services will open portions of the J Building to a one-day public tour prior to demolition. This will provide people with an opportunity to say goodbye to a building that has long been a part of Salem’s history. It will also be an opportunity to view a model of the planned new hospital. The tentative date for the open house tour is September 10, 2008.[1][2][3][4]

Oregon,Fairview Hospital and Training Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fairview_Hospital_and_Training_Center,1907,1908,1908,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Oregon Fairview Home,"Fairview was established by the legislature in 1907 as the State Institution for the Feeble-Minded. The institution was created as a ""quasi-educational institution"" charged with educating the ""feeble-minded"" and caring for the ""idiotic and epileptic."" A Board of Trustees consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and State Treasurer was created to oversee the institution. The actual management of the institution was the job of the superintendent. The legislature appropriated $10,000 for operating expenses and $100,000 for lands and buildings. The institution was situated on a 670 acre plot southwest of Salem and construction had proceeded to the point that the first residents were transferred from the Oregon State Hospital in December, 1908.
The first residents were admitted to a compound consisting of an administration building, a dormitory building, a laundry and a boiler house. During the next two years, two more cottages were constructed with beds and accommodations for 60 persons each.
The Board of Trustees was replaced by the Board of Control in 1913. The Board of Control was created to provide centralized administration of state institutions. In new enabling legislation, the institution was charged with ""the care and training of such feeble-minded, idiotic, epileptic, and defective persons as have been or may hereafter be committed to its custody."" Many of the early admissions were epileptic; few were severely physically handicapped. Consequently, emphasis was placed on training for practical work.
A commitment law was passed in 1917 to standardize admissions and to insure that valuable space was used for the ""feeble-minded"" and not the ""insane."" It also stated that no one under 5 years of age was to be admitted. This age limitation was removed four years later.
Farming and husbandry were important parts of Fairview, providing both food and training for the residents. Most of the farm land had been cleared by 1920, 400 acres were used for crops and 45 acres used for orchards. Livestock consisted of hogs, chickens, and both dairy and beef cattle.
In 1923, the Board of Eugenics was formed, with the institution superintendent serving as an ex-officio board member. The organizing legislation provided for the ""sterilization of all feeble-minded, insane, epileptics, habitual criminals, moral degenerates, and sexual perverts who are a menace to society."" Sterilizations required either the person's consent or a judicial proceeding resulting in a court order. By 1929, 300 residents had been sterilized.
The connection between parole and sterilization was not explicit, but two-thirds of the residents that were sterilized were paroled, freeing up valuable bed space in the institution.
The Depression and World War II combined to limit program expansion and capital improvement. In 1940 employees were moved to housing separate from buildings used by the patients. By the end of the 1946 biennium, conditions were improving, more staff were available due to the conclusion of the war and the passage of the State Civil Service and Retirement Acts. A tuberculosis control program was also instituted at this time. In 1948, the first dormitory built in 16 years still left the Institution overcrowded as a result of the lack of construction. The farm showed an increase in production over the previous decades. In 1957, a new administration building and the gymnasium-auditorium, first requested in 1913, were built.
Following World War II, Fairview's resident profile began to change. Medical care techniques improved nationally, greatly increasing the life expectancy of severely handicapped patients. The number of residents with severe emotional/social handicaps also increased. These two factors contributed to a steady decrease in the median mental age of the institutional population and changed Fairview's emphasis from education to care. The 1953 biennial report stated that: ""We [Fairview] are no longer used as a school for those who have only educational difficulty, as this is being taken care of in the public school system.""
Fairview began providing out-patient services to mentally ill persons not in its custody in 1954. Organizational changes in the late fifties brought new duties to Fairview. Departments of Psychology, Social Service, and Recreation were added to the staff. Diagnostic clinics and parents' conferences were provided as community services. Medical services and dietary standards were brought into conformance with U.S. Department of Agriculture requirements.
The decline in the incidence of tuberculosis made it impractical to maintain a separate ward, and the few tubercular patients at Fairview were transferred to the tuberculosis ward at the Oregon State Hospital.
Research funds in the amount of $14,000,000 were provided by the 1957 Legislature. This funding was dedicated to research in the treatment and training of mentally retarded persons. Fairview staff viewed this funding and the subsequent research as instrumental in providing high levels of service to retarded Oregonians.
In 1961, the institution reorganized into two broad units, business services and medical (patient) services. Fairview also began using the ""Unit System,"" interdisciplinary teams, consisting of a physician, chairman, psychologist, social worker, and nursing supervisor, to serve residents' needs. Several new services were added at the same time. Visiting and consulting physicians were added to the medical staff and the patient record-keeping system was established by the newly-appointed medical records librarian. Chaplains were hired to meet the spiritual needs of the residents. A research laboratory was established. Approximately 250 patients were transferred from Fairview to Columbia Park Training Center in The Dalles between June and October 1963.
Oregon Fairview Home was renamed Fairview Hospital and Training Center in 1965. Epileptics were no longer cared for at Fairview and were either released to community care or transferred to the State Hospital.
Several new programs were initiated during the late sixties. The Physical Rehabilitation Center opened in March 1966. The Foster Grandparent program began during the 1966-68 biennium with 39 senior citizens serving 78 young residents. Major changes in the Farm and Grounds program took place, eliminating orchard, beef, and general farm activities. Improvements were made in the vocational training programs in poultry processing, grounds and greenhouse, and construction of the new food service building commenced.
In 1969, the Board of Control was dissolved and the Mental Health Division placed under the newly created Executive Department. Legal representation for persons involved in commitment hearings was required by a 1969 law.
During the following decade there were revolutionary advancement in methods of teaching residents with developmental disabilities. Federal funds became available to provide additional program opportunities to Fairview residents. These changes required increases in staff, especially those with educational backgrounds.
The last of the formerly extensive farming operations ceased with the closing of the poultry operations on June 30, 1977. The raising of hogs was discontinued two years earlier, ceasing operations that had provided all the ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, broilers, and pork chops used by Fairview. These operations slowly fell into red ink, becoming less appropriate for training programs as the average capability level of the residents declined.
A great change in the use of physical facilities also took place during this decade with the conversion of the apartments from housing of staff to housing of residents who were undergoing pre-release training. Four of the houses were also used in program training. Prigg Cottage was turned over to Corrections and these residents were assigned to the main campus on or before June 1976. Columbia Park Hospital was closed on June 30, 1977, and its residents were transferred to Fairview.
A court decision upheld a 1973 national re-definition of ""mental retardation"" that lowered the threshold I.Q. for mental retardation from 80 to 70. This resulted in the possible release of up to 84 residents who became ineligible for continued services. In addition, Fairview instituted an intensive 3-6 month community living skills training program for those residents who had chosen to wait for release.
During 1979, the facility changed its name from Fairview Hospital and Training Center to Fairview Training Center. In 1983, the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the physical well-being of residents. The Institution was also put on alert that on-going inspections could be expected.
In July 1984, the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) warned Fairview that federal funds would be cut within 180 days if federal standards were not met. As a result the state proposed a $25.3 million improvement plan and the funding cut-off was averted.
From March to June 1985, the U.S. Justice Department stated that it found life-threatening conditions at Fairview. State officials contended that federal officials ignored improvements. During this time the first Qualified Mental Retardation Professionals (QMRP) were classified and the Foster Grandparent Program celebrated its 20th anniversary.
The year also brought a suit filed by the U.S. Justice Department, the Association of Retarded Citizens (ARC) and two parents of Fairview residents against the State over Fairview's conditions. Within a year the Health Care Financing Administration cut off Medicaid funding over safety and staffing issues. An additional 600 employees were also hired during this time. By June, the House had approved Fairview funds and 30 million supplemental dollars were approved by the Joint Ways and Means Committee for Fairview improvements and development of community programs.
By August 1987, Medicaid funds were restored after a 14 week loss of $7 million and Fairview staff continued to work toward improving issues at the Training Center. During September 1988, HCFA revisited Fairview verifying that some of the immediate problems had been corrected, yet deciding to cut off Medicaid funds due to a concern about ""Active Treatment"" plans. The State appealed this decision.
In December, Governor Goldschmidt proposed spending an additional $14.7 million on Fairview and the development of Community Placement Programs during 1989-91, also recommending the reduction of client population by 50% to less than 500 by June 30, 1992. A congressional delegation urged HCFA to settle.
Finally an agreement was announced promising Fairview funds for a plan that establishes benchmarks for improvement. Federal reviews followed at six month intervals while the Justice Department and the Association of Retarded Citizens of Oregon's law suits remained pending. (Settlement was reached in July of 1989.)
Until its closure in July 2000, Fairview had served the mentally and physically handicapped for nearly a century. Its few remaining residents were transferred to group homes or returned to live with their families. Plans to utilize the abandoned grounds of Fairview include three ""pedestrian-oriented residential neighborhoods"" with large green spaces and a school or a campus of light commercial businesses.
A fire in 2010 destroyed one of the cottage buildings in the center of campus. As the vacant building fell into disrepair, the state fought to find a use for the property. Several of the newer style medical buildings were demolished. Finally, after several more failed attempts for reuse of the property, the remainder of buildings were demolished in early 2015. The historic cottage buildings were demolished in March of 2015.",2000,"Salem, OR",,"2,600 in 1962"

Oregon,Multnomah County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Multnomah_County_Poor_Farm,1868,1869,1911 (second location),Preserved,Single Building,Bridges & Webber,Edgefield Manor | Edgefield Lodge,"The Multnomah County Poor Farm in Troutdale was built in 1911 to replace Multnomah County's first home for the destitute, the Hillside Farm in Portland's West Hills. The latter institution, which housed the poor, ill, and disabled, was inspected in the fall of 1910 by a coalition of members from Portland charitable organizations who declared the crumbling building and its deplorable conditions to be disgraceful.
That spurred Multnomah County Commissioners to hasten work on a progressive new institution at Troutdale intended to help the poor become self-sufficient through farming. This ""back to the land"" concept in social welfare was based on the belief that the poor could enjoy fresh air and country living while growing their own food.
The farm, which ultimately grew to 345 acres, was completed in a year at a cost of $100,000, and included a main lodge, outbuildings, dairy, and piggery. In November 1911, 211 inmates (later called residents) moved in, 75 of whom were bedridden due to chronic or untreated illness. ""Meat and mush"" tables divided residents: those able to work in the fields or in the institution ate meat three meals a day; the others had meat only once a day.
By 1914, the Poor Farm was a success on paper. It housed 302 residents and managed a herd of Holstein dairy cows, 100 Duroc hogs (that ate the leftovers from the dining room), 420 Plymouth Rock hens, and 225 chickens. The crops, vegetables, fruit, hay, grain, eggs, and twenty-seven acres of potatoes were shared with the county jail (which provided some trustees to work in the fields), a hospital, and a juvenile home. The farm's population peaked in 1935 at 614 residents—535 men and 63 women. Soon after, President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and the job boom of World War II lured the able-bodied to leave the farm and re-enter the job market. Post-war welfare and Social Security programs dispersed the remaining residents, leaving behind those who were disabled or had become so accustomed to institutional life that they were unable to live independently.
The farm concept was gradually abandoned. The county jail, built on the site in 1959 largely because the land was available, had no prisoners who would toil in the fields. The dairy herd was sold in 1969 and the fields were leased. In 1964, the main lodge was renamed Edgefield and became a nursing home, the first in Oregon to offer physical rehabilitation. It served in that capacity until 1982, when the buildings were closed and all but abandoned.
By 1985, neglected and ravaged by vandals, Edgefield was declared ""dilapidated beyond repair"" and destined for demolition. The Troutdale Historical Society challenged the county, claiming that the buildings were historic and should be protected. Preservationists staved off demolition for nearly five years before the complex was purchased in 1990 by micro-brew pioneers Mike and Brian McMenamin, who wanted to try their hands at the hotel business.
Edgefield, located in Troutdale at 2126 S.W. Halsey Street, is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a destination resort with pubs, restaurants, theaters, gardens, and a golf course. The complex includes a winery, brewery and distillery, a restaurant, and a concert venue that has hosted such notables as BB King and Ringo Starr.

Oregon,Morningside Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Morningside_Hospital,1883,,1904,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Morningside Asylum,"In 1883, Dr. Henry Waldo Coe founded Morningside Hospital in three large houses he privately owned in northwest Portland with the intention of treating mentally ill patients. Over the next twenty years, he operated a number of residential treatment homes, including Mindsease, Crystal Springs, and Mt Tabor.
On June 6, 1900, Congress passed a law that allowed the U.S. Department of the Interior Office of the Territories to contract for the care of Alaska’s psychiatric patients. Between 1900 and 1904, Alaskans who needed care were sent to the Oregon Insane Asylum (later called the Oregon State Hospital). In 1904, a private contract was signed between the Office of the Territories and the Sanitarium Company (Morningside Hospital) to care for those patients. In January 1904, Coe moved his first Alaskan patients from the state asylum to Morningside’s permanent site, a 50-acre, 350-patient hospital at 10008 Southeast Stark Street.
Between 1905 and 1968, approximately 3,500 Alaskan patients—including many Alaskan Natives—were admitted to Morningside Hospital. Morningside also provided emergency hospitalization services for the Portland area, as well as care for other federal beneficiaries, including veterans.
In 1955, Morningside Hospital became one of the first ""open hospitals"" in America, which meant that it had “no locked wards.” Instead, the staff controlled patient behavior through the use of psychiatric drugs. Also in 1955, Morningside was investigated by the U.S. General Accounting Office regarding financial practices and patient care. The investigation began after Oregon U.S. Representative Edith Green introduced a bill to transfer the care of Alaskan patients to Alaska. The GAO found that from 1936 to 1953, the hospital had received a net profit of $671,696 and that owner Wayne Coe (Henry's son) had received a salary of $443,500. Coe, the GAO concluded, ""has diverted substantial sums...for the personal use of himself and his family.” The GAO also criticized Morningside’s internment and burial practices.
As a result of the investigation, Congress passed the Alaska Mental Health Act on January 18, 1956, granting Alaska permission to construct its own mental health facilities. Another investigation followed. On June 9, 1957, the Oregonian reported that “a house government operations subcommittee decided to carry out a full-scale investigation of Morningside” into the deaths of eleven patients between 1948 and 1955. The findings were inconclusive, however, and no charges were filed. Morningside Hospital received full accreditation in 1958.
Alaska did not renew its contract with Morningside Hospital in 1960, and the hospital's Alaskan patients returned to their home state by 1962. Between 1962 and 1968, the hospital took private patients; by 1964, only 135 people were under its care. Morningside Hospital, which was still privately managed by the Coe family, closed in 1968. It was sold to Lenrich Associations, a private contractor, for the construction of Mall 205.

Oregon,Portland Institute for the Insane,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Portland_Institute_for_the_Insane,1861,,1861,Demolished,Single Building,,Hawthorne Asylum | Oregon Hospital for the Insane,"The first institution in Oregon devoted to the care of the mentally ill was the Oregon Hospital for the Insane.  Drs. James C. Hawthorne and A.M. Loryea opened the private hospital in September of 1861 in a temporary building on Taylor Street between First and Second Avenues in Portland.  Somewhat ironically, the proprietors made it very clear that their hospital was only a temporary fix for the state’s mental health care needs, and stated at the dedication of the new institution that they would happily turn over their patients to the state in the event that it created an asylum to care for them.
In 1862, the hospital was moved to a new building off of Hawthorne Avenue, east of SE 12th Avenue.   The State of Oregon contracted with the hospital in the fall of that year to provide services for “indigent insane and idiotic persons” that were court ordered there.  The hospital treated court ordered and private patients suffering from many forms of diseases including what Drs. Hawthorne and Loryea described as: mania, monomania, melancholia, dementia and idiocy.
In 1872, Loreya sold his portion of the hospital to Dr. Hawthorne and moved back to San Francisco.  In 1880, the Oregon State Legislature finally appropriated funds for the building of an Asylum in Salem, finally getting the ball rolling on a project years in the making (land had been secured for the building as early as 1868).  Dr. Hawthorne died in February of 1881.  Upon his death, Dr. Simeon Josephi took over the operation of the hospital until the completion of the Oregon State Insane Asylum in Salem.  On October 23, 1883 Dr. Josephi and Mrs. Hawthorne (wife of the late Dr. Hawthorne) transferred control of the patients in their care to a board of trustees consisting of state officials.  From October 22-24, 370 patients were transported from Portland to the new Oregon State Hospital in Salem by rail.",1883,"Portland, OR",,

Oregon,Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oregon_State_Tuberculosis_Hospital,1894,,1910,Closed,Cottage Plan,,,"The first sanatorium in the Pacific Northwest was opened on Milwaukie Heights in 1905. However, those who were not financially able remained neglected. A state facility was needed, and finally the abandoned Deaf-Mute School in Salem was purchased to accommodate the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital, the first state owned and operated tuberculosis sanatorium in the West.
In 1909 the Oregon State Legislature enacted laws designating that a tuberculosis sanatorium was to be operated to provide treatment for tuberculosis patients who were unable to secure proper care elsewhere, where patients were to be educated in the proper techniques of healthful living and how to avoid spreading the disease and also to segregate those in the advanced state of the disease to eliminate the danger of infection. This was the first such action taken by any of the Western states.
Prior to this, in 1894, construction was started on a building designated to be the Oregon State Deaf-Mute School, and was so occupied during the years of 1896 and 1897, but because of the inability to transport supplies over the nearly non-existent roads this building southeast of Salem was abandoned. After the Legislature enacted the laws for a sanatorium for treatment of the tubercular, one of the senators of that time saw this site, nestled in the foothills with available buildings, and action was taken to utilize this for the proposed Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital.
On November 21, 1910 the first five patients were admitted to the fifty-bed Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital. H. J. Clement, M.D., who was superintendent in 1910 and 1911, then administered hospital business and the medical program. During that time additional open-air facilities, Pavilion Pierce and an open air Summer House were completed. P. H. Fitzgerald, M.D., served as superintendent in 1912, and Grover C. Bellinger, M.D. became superintendent in 1913. He remained the only physician on the staff until the end of World War I, when Dr. P. L. Newmyer joined him.
Also in 1913, the Board of Control was created and became director of the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital.
Early construction was centered mostly on the pavilion type of treatment facility, with Pavilion Butler constructed in 1919, Pavilion C erected in 1923 and Pavilion D constructed in 1925. Physicians Cottage I was constructed in 1919 and before this, the engine room and dairy barn were built in 1912. For many years the hospital maintained a large herd of cows to supply the needs of both patients and employees living there. At this time, and for many years following, they also maintained a farming project which included raising of all garden supplies and feed for the dairy animals. The greenhouse was constructed in 1922. Physicians Cottage II was built in 1932.
Pavilion C was made into a children's' preventorium and treatment center, with schooling offered to both bed patients and patients with exercise. In 1941 this program was taken over by the State Program for Education of the Handicapped Children, and the department furnished teachers and school programs for all school age pupils so that they could maintain their study program while hospitalized.
A professional rehabilitation program was initiated with the assistance of the Oregon State Tuberculosis and Health Association; this was eventually taken over by the Oregon State Vocational Rehabilitation Department.
In 1910 the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital had only 50 beds available; in 1917 there were 75 beds in operation. In 1919 construction of Pavilion Butler brought the bed count up to 105, and construction of Pavilion C in 1923 made 150 beds available. In 1923 a modern paved highway extended from Salem to the hospital, and additional facilities in Pavilion D made 195 available beds for the treatment and care of the tubercular.
As the need for beds was so much greater than the facilities available a modern two-story hospital was completed in 1932; in 1933, 15 extra beds were placed in the Administration Building for a colony of patients who had reached a satisfactory stage of convalescence. Also, at that time a 270 bed hospital was constructed in Eastern Oregon at The Dalles, known as the Eastern Oregon Tuberculosis Hospital, to better care for more of the State of Oregon who were afflicted with this dreaded, contagious disease, to make facilities for the long ""waiting list"" of persons who needed treatment. These two hospitals were run in conjunction until 1934, when J. M. O'Dell became Superintendent at Eastern Oregon Tuberculosis Hospital.
In 1934 a third floor was added to the hospital in Salem, and a Nurses Home was constructed that housed 40 of the nursing personnel. Good use was made of WPA labor and brick reclaimed after the fire of the Oregon State Capitol in this construction. Physicians Cottage III was made in 1938 and Physicians Cottage IV was built in 1949. In 1955 Physicians Cottage V was completed.
Due to deterioration and fire hazard, Pavilion Pierce was razed in 1947; the Summer House was closed in 1948 and razed in 1956. However, a great need for beds still remained, with a long list of patients waiting for beds and in 1954 and 1955 two new floors were added to the hospital, with the first admission there on May 31, 1955. This construction also included the new, completely up to date surgery, pharmacy and laboratory. After that date it was not necessary for residents of Oregon with tuberculosis to wait for an admission to a tuberculosis hospital. During this period new construction included a paint shop, machinists shop and truck storage, and a new dormitory to house men and women employees, constructed in 1953.
In June 1954, Dr. G. C. Bellinger retired as Superintendent of the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital, and Dr. Robert E. Joseph received appointment by the Board of Control to step up from Assistant Superintendent to Superintendent.
Prior to this date, the Oregon State Legislature adopted a measure to provide protection for the citizenry of the state by placing those recalcitrant who would not accept hospitalization and treatment under isolation and quarantine. Quarters were specifically prepared for the isolation and treatment of these patients.
With the advent of new drugs over the last few years, and surgical treatment, the need for hospital beds had lessened somewhat, as the period of treatment was shortened; subsequently the three remaining pavilions were closed but maintained in readiness. In 1957 Pavilion D was razed, leaving only two pavilions standing. Those 71 beds however, could be opened at any time to care for an influx of patients, or to care for patients in a time of national emergency.
In May 1959, because of the reduced population at both the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital and the Eastern Oregon Tuberculosis Hospital, the remaining 19 patients at the latter were moved to the hospital in Salem and the Eastern Oregon Tuberculosis Hospital was converted to a geriatric service with the title of Oregon State Mid-Columbia Home.
It was necessary to replace the reservoir constructed in 1894 by a new one-half million-gallon tank to store water for the institution, and for two neighboring state institutions.
The methods of treating tuberculosis years ago had long been replaced by new methods. The only available treatment in early years was that of complete rest and adequate diet. After that the patients were treated with pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum, phrenic surgery, thoracoplasty, with very little medication to help the patient. Gold was first administered in the mid 1930's as a treatment for tuberculosis. Later streptomycin, then Isoniazid and Para-aminosalicylate acid were added to the list of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy and gold was no longer used.
The patients with anti-tuberculosis medications and surgery available could anticipate an average stay of just over six months, instead of the hospitalization period of several years. Although the period of hospitalization was much shorter, many more patients were admitted yearly; for example during 1959, 324 patients were admitted to the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital.
Landscaped grounds surrounded the hospital, located on a hillside overlooking a wide expanse of the Willamette Valley. The original beauty of natural shrubbery was enhanced with rock walls, terraces, trees, shrubs, flowers, and winding paths. Inside the buildings you could find modern equipment for the use of the doctors and nurses in the care of the patients: x-ray, lamp therapy, a laboratory, surgery facilities and other departments. The dietary department maintained a high caliber of service with excellent food to help the patients to regain their health.
Film interpretation service was provided by the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital and was available without cost to all doctors and health departments in the state. During the year of 1959 the staff studied and reported on 12,126 x-rays, representing 6,714 different patients. Through this service 83 patients were admitted to the hospital for treatment. Also, through this service other patients were led to accept hospitalization and treatment either through their private physicians or through treatment centers such as the Veterans Administration Hospital.
During the year of 1959 the staff performed 1,399 examinations on outpatients - those patients who had been discharged from the hospital and those who had been referred by their physician or health department. The Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital received a full accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals of America and Canada on October 27, 1955, and was able to maintain this accreditation through tri-yearly inspections; they maintained membership in the Association of Western Hospitals.
Through the social service department the patients maintained contact with the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, the Department of Public Welfare, the Veterans Administration and the State Department of Service for the Blind. The Occupational Therapy Department was fully equipped with wood working machinery, ceramic supplies and kiln, and supplies for leather tooling, knitting and other handicrafts, to help the patient keep busy during his period of treatment.
During this fifty-year period 8,050 new patients were admitted to the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital; also 25%, or at least 2,000 of these persons, were re-admitted for further hospitalization and treatment. Through the hospitalization of these many persons, the hospital had an active part in assisting over 8,000 residents of the State of Oregon regain their health, and helped them return to their homes and communities as active citizens. There were an estimated 3,600 employees of the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital to serve 8,050 patients.
An ex-patient, twenty-four years after his discharge, returned to tour the hospital, to view the place where he spent eight years of his life. On admission, at age 18, he was expected to live only one or two months. On discharge, at age 26, he had to borrow money to leave the hospital. He developed a business that grossed a million dollars yearly. Not all of the patients were this successful, but a great majority of the people returned to a useful, satisfying life.
The Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital maintained an affiliation with the Practical Nurse Training Program of the Salem Adult Education Program. Through this, trainees were taught the specialties of tuberculosis care. They were justly proud of their association with the health departments of Oregon. To further this understanding between the hospital and health departments they held a Public Health Nurse orientation meeting of two days, where nurses from all over the state became acquainted with patient treatment and the recommended requirements of the patients at the time of their discharge.
With the opening of the University Tuberculosis Hospital, the waiting list of patients at the Salem facility became nearly non-existent. The University Tuberculosis Hospital was dedicated in 1939 on the University of Oregon Medical School Campus in Portland. Operation of the hospital was in the competent hands of Dean Richard B. Dillehunt, M.D. David W. Baird was appointed medical director and Ralf Couch, administrator with Ralph C. Matson as chief surgeon. In 1963, the State Legislature combined the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital in Salem with the University of Oregon Medical School State Tuberculosis Hospital. As a result, patients located in the University State Tuberculosis Hospital on the Portland campus were transferred to the State Hospital in Salem. [1]",1967,"Salem, OR",,
