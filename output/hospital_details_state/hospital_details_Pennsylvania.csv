Pennsylvania,Allentown State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Allentown_State_Hospital,"July 18, 1901","June 27, 1904","October 3, 1912",Demolished,Pavilion Plan,,Pennsylvania State Homeopathic Asylum,"The first step for the establishment of a homeopathic state hospital for the insane in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was taken by the Germantown Homeopathic Medical Society of Philadelphia, which appointed a committee of twelve of its members, of which Isaac W. Heysinger, M. D., was chairman, for the purpose of introducing and furthering a bill before the State Legislature to provide for the selection of a site and the construction of a state hospital for the care of the insane to be under homeopathic management and control. After several unsuccessful attempts a bill was finally passed by both houses of the Pennsylvania Legislature, June 25-26, 1901, entitled, "" An Act to Provide for the Selection of a Site and the Erection of a State Hospital for the Treatment of the Insane Under Homeopathic Management, to be Called the Homeopathic State Hospital for the Insane, and Making an Appropriation Therefor.""
On July 18, 1901, the bill was approved by Gov. Wm. A. Stone, except as to Section 5, which provided for an appropriation of $300,000 to enable the commissioners to purchase land and commence the erection of buildings, from which the Governor withheld his approval in the sum of $250,000 because of insufficient state revenue. The commission received several propositions from places within the territory of the twelve counties comprising the hospital district. During December, 1902, they visited a number of the sites offered to them in Lehigh, Northampton, Monroe, Bradford and Wayne counties. Three places in Lehigh County were under consideration aid finally the section in Hanover Township, near Allentown, was chosen upon which to locate the new hospital, the tract secured by the state comprising 209 acres. The corner-stone was laid June 27, 1904. The failure of the Legislature to appropriate, and of the Governor to approve what the Legislature did appropriate, the moneys that were necessary to expeditiously proceed with the erection and construction of the buildings caused a great deal of needless delay in the completion of the institution for its estimated capacity of 1000 patients. This delay occasioned considerable public and legislative agitation, so that the organic law of 1901 was amended by the Legislature and approved by the Governor the 10th of May, 1911. The amendment vested the appointment of the entire commission in the Governor and required the approval of the Superintendent of Public Grounds and Buildings to plans and specifications and expenditures incurred by the commission. It also authorized the commission to turn over to a Board of Trustees the buildings when completed. The amended act brought about the removal of the original commission and the appointment of a new one. This, with the appropriation of an ample sum of money, resulted in the completion of the institution during 1912.
The hospital is located on a high tract of land on the north bank of the Lehigh River, between Allentown and Bethlehem, about two miles from the former and three miles from the latter city. The Central Railroad of New Jersey runs immediately adjacent to the farm at the foot of its southern slope. The Allentown and Bethlehem Electric Line passes along the front of the property to the north. The arrangement of the institution consists of an administration department, three buildings; four ward buildings, two chapels, a building containing staff and congregate dining rooms, operating room and auditorium; a building for kitchen, ice and cold storage plant; a laundry building, and a boiler, power and electric light plant. The main water supply is obtained from the Bethlehem City water works, and is brought to the hospital grounds by gravity, from which point it is pumped into two 1,000,000-gallon capacity reservoirs. In addition to this, the institution has an artesian well and a 3600-gallon storage tank for emergency use. The original cost of the land and erection of buildings was: for farm $58,000; buildings, power and electric plant and sewerage system, $1,821,000; reservoir, $29,950; pumping station, $22,320; a total of $1,931,270. The hospital was architecturally patterned after the Kirkbride block plan. The administration, ward and service buildings are all connected by corridors, mainly of two stories, and the internal arrangement consists of dormitories of varying capacity.
Governor John K. Tener in February, 1912, appointed the following Board of Trustees: Harry C. Trexler, president; Edward M. Young, secretary and treasurer; Russell C. Stewart, Archibald Johnston, John J. Tuller, M. D., Wm. A. Seibert, M. D., Leonard Peckitt, F. J. Slough, M. D., and George R. Bedford. Their first act was the appointment of Henry I. Klopp as physician and superintendent, February 17, 1912. He assumed charge March 25, 1912. The first years may well be regarded as epoch-making ones for the hospital. There devolved upon the superintendent all the labor of furnishing and equipping the institution for a capacity of 1000 patients; the developing and perfecting of an organization consistent with the rapid growth in numbers of the patient population, especially so during the first six months of the opening of the hospital; the outlining of methods of treatment and classification of patients; above all, laying the foundation for future development and expansion along modern scientific lines.
The hospital was opened for the reception of patients October 3, 1912. From this date to February 1, 1913, a weekly transfer was received from either Norristown State Hospital or the Danville State Hospital; there were admitted within this time 820 patients; of this number 750 were transfers. By the end of the official hospital year, namely, May 31, 1913, the total admissions numbered 934 For the year ending May 31, 1914, there were admitted 299 patients; the whole number under treatment for the year was 1166. First consideration was given to the treatment of the so-called ""recoverable"" patients; also to the organization of a training school for nurses, upon a three-years basis, in accordance with the recommendations of the State Board of Registration for Nurses. The value of diversional occupation and recreation as therapeutic agents was recognized; provision was made accordingly by the equipment and organization of workshops and special occupation therapy, and the employment of industrial instructors educated for such work. Many difficulties had to be met, as the internal layout of the hospital was far from ideal to carry out twentieth-century ideas in the classification and treatment of patients, as well as for economy and efficiency in operation, the plans for the building having been made almost a decade prior to the opening of the institution, the most serious drawbacks being inadequate accommodations for the reception and proper classification of newly admitted cases and lack of facilities to carry out hospital treatment, especially the absence of continuous baths and hydro-therapeutic equipment.
The medical work was organized along general hospital lines, each patient receiving a thorough mental and physical examination. Efforts are made to obtain family and personal history in detail. Patients on admission are treated as sick, a preliminary course of rest in bed (of varying duration) being prescribed; mechanical, drug or chemical restraint as well as seclusion is dispensed with; the treatment, in conjunction with rest in bed, consisting of an ample supply of fresh air, nutritious food, hydrotherapy, individual attention and influence, and indicated remedy. With improvement, and as progress permits, modification of rest by gradual exercise, bedside suggestion and re-education are substituted, and finally occupation therapy is employed. Medical staff meetings are held daily for the examination and study of patients and the review of current medical literature, both general and special. The staff has been provided with the most practical diagnostic appliances covering the various specialties, thus being able to make an intelligent diagnosis and treat the individual patient scientifically from a medical as well as a surgical standpoint. The equipment includes pathological, bacteriological chemical and haematological laboratory outfits, an electrical and X-ray apparatus, a dental outfit and a medical library. The trustees appointed a consulting staff, consisting of 26 members of the profession, each prominent in his chosen specialty.
Not being content with the arrangement of the hospital, application was made, through the Board of Trustees, to the first session of the Legislature after the opening of the institution, and a bill was passed covering special appropriations for "" new buildings, changes and improvements,"" amounting to $200,000, which, on account of lack of funds, the Governor found it necessary to veto to the amount of $127,500. The appropriation included a reception building for new admissions, a home for nurses, two buildings for tubercular patients, isolation cottage for contagious diseases, changes in the buildings for hydrotherapy and continuous bath equipment, dairy, barn, piggery, farm building repairs, and coal tramway from railroad to power house.
The superintendent in his first annual report, under date of May 31, 1914, makes the following statement: ""What we may accomplish within the coming decade will largely depend upon the General Assembly. If this "" state hospital"" is to grow in efficiency in the care and treatment of the mentally sick, the commonwealth must provide liberally for it. Within another year we will have reached our full capacity and soon will be overcrowded. To properly care for this growing population the state should appropriate money for buildings for 100 additional beds annually."" In order to obtain proper observation, classification and treatment of patients the plans of the reception building for new admissions, which is to form the first unit of a psychopathic division, contain modern facilities for the admission of patients, continuous baths, hydrotherapy and open-air treatment. Among the needs for which requests for special appropriations from the 1915 Legislature will be made are a reception building, to form the second unit for a receiving division so as to properly care for both sexes; a second nurses' home; two buildings to provide for nurses' and attendants' dining rooms, with second-story quarters for employees; a double house for farm employees; industrial building for men patients, and items covering improvements and changes for the more advantageous operation of the mstitution.
The business methods of the hospital were organized along lines of economy and efficiency. The bookkeeping system, storeroom accounts, issuing of supplies, discarding and exchange system, variation of weekly dietaries and per capita cost of same, and daily waste reports, received attention. A saving of thousands of dollars in water and steam was effected by the installation of a central hot-water system through the collection of hot water which had been daily going to waste from the cold storage plant. In addition to this an economy of 1500 tons of coal per annum was brought about by various changes in the steamheating plant. The installation of an aerial tramway from the railroad to the power plant for the delivery of coal supplants the expensive method of delivery by teams.
The hospital receives its maintenance for the care and treatment of patients under the dual system of the "" County and State Care Act"" Patients are classed either as indigent or private; for the former, the county is required to pay a per capita of $1.75 and the state S2.50 per week; when the financial circumstances of the patient or relatives are such that they can pay a rate of not less than $5 per week, the patient is designated as "" private."" For the year ending May 31, 1914, the institution maintained itself upon this basis. Schedules are issued quarterly by the institution for the purchase of supplies and provisions, for which bids are received and contracts awarded to the lowest bidder consistent with quality. The medical department was organized by securing the services Dr. Harry F. Hoffman as assistant superintendent, prior to his appointment senior assistant physician at the Norwich State Hospital, Norwich, Conn., and Dr. Walter E. Lang as senior assistant physician, and prior to his acceptance associated with the Easton Sanitarium. The junior assistants, Dr. Charles S. Trites and Dr. Sarah Adleman, received their appointments in December, 1912. In June, 1913, Dr. Charles B. Reitz was appointed to take charge of and develop the laboratory. Dr. Sarah Adleman resigned August 31, 1913, to accept a position in a private institution. Dr. Bernice A. Bartlett was appointed to the position of junior assistant September 10, 1913.[1]
Over the years, the population and physical plant continued to expand, reaching a census high of 2,012 in 1950. The population of 175 (in 2008) represents a trend towards decreasing populations in state hospitals, especially over the past decade. The major decline in the census since the 1950s can be attributed in part to the Mental Health Procedures Act of 1976 which lead to an increase in community mental health services, also the developments in the field of psychopharmacology, and  a transfer of funding from the State Hospitals to the community through the Community Hospital Integration Program Project (CHIPPs). Allentown State Hospital received patients primarily from a five-county service area. The counties specifically were Lehigh, Northampton, Carbon, Monroe, and Pike. These counties included the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, as well as a number of smaller municipalities.
Another unique aspect of the hospital was the development of a psychiatric treatment program for psychiatrically impaired children. This program, under the direction of Dr. Klopp, was opened in 1930 and functioned as the only program of its type in the state until the 1960s when Eastern State School and Hospital was opened. The Mental Health Institute for Children, as it was called, maintained a population of 140 children from across the state during the years when it was the only statewide facility for children. With the development of alternate programs in the community and construction of a State Hospital dedicated to children and adolescents, the need for the facility became less crucial and the unit was closed in June of 1992.
The Hospital maintains a close working relationship with the county mental health programs resulting in a free flow of information which assists in enhancing the treatment of patients, both in the Hospital and in the Community. This was due, in large part, to the CHIPPs program which not only discharged 130 patients from the hospital to more appropriate community settings, but transferred monies from the hospital budget to the county for developing long lasting infrastructures. CHIPPs would not have worked unless there were close and cooperative interactions between the hospital and the counties.
During the past decade, the hospital has undergone several significant changes in treating patients. The practice of seclusion, restraint and prn medications was replaced by the philosophy of ""The more you do with the patients, the less you have to do to them"". In 1992 a Psychiatric Emergency Response Team (PERT) was formed and trained to handle individuals in crisis by talking to them and putting them in restraint/seclusion only as a last resort. Following Deputy Secretary of Mental Health, Charlie Curie's decree to reduce these two means of controlling patients, Allentown State Hospital saw seclusion and restraint as treatment failures rather than as treatment options. Two hours of program off the unit every weekday was instituted as a unique Centralized Program in September of 1998. In November of that year, seclusion was used for the last time at Allentown State Hospital - the first in the nation to go ""seclusion free"". The use of restraints was cut dramatically as well. Recreational activities were increased four fold on the weekends, although participation in them is voluntary.[2]
In October of 2009 several news agencies announced the possible closure of Allentown State Hospital. The PA Department of Public Welfare announced in January of 2010 that it would completely close the hospital by the end of 2010.[3] Patients would be either transferred to Wernersville State Hospital or to community care facilities.[4] Many protests to the closing have been made by employees and the community,[5] but as of March 2010 the hospital is still on track to be closed by the end of the year. The official closing ceremony took place on December 14, 2010 at 1:00 PM.
The Allentown State Hospital demolition was completed on December 28, 2020.[6] The land was put up for sale and re-development.[7]

Pennsylvania,Clarks Summit State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Clarks_Summit_State_Hospital,"Sept 29, 1938 (As a PA State Hospital)",,1862,Active,Cottage Plan,,Clark Summit Poor Farm | Hillside Home and Hospital,"Clarks Summit State Hospital originated in 1862 when citizens of Providence Township developed a poor farm. As the years passed, the mentally ill were also provided care at the facility. At a later date, the responsibility for the operation of the poor farm was assumed by the City of Scranton, the Borough of Dunmore, and eventually, Lackawanna County. On September 29, 1938 the state took control of the hospital as part of the ""Full State Care Act"". The legislature (Act #53) assumed responsibility for eight of the thirteen existing county public mental hospitals, the other five hospitals were closed.
By the early 1940's, the Hillside Home and Hillside Hospital were operational in buildings currently named Abington Hall and Newton Hall. The name was changed from Hillside Home and Hospital to Clarks Summit State Hospital on October 1, 1943, when the Department of Public Welfare, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, assumed the responsibility to operate and manage state mental hospitals.
By the mid 1950's Clarks Summit State Hospital was serving the residents of Lackawanna County and approximately 150 Luzerne County residents who were transferred in 1947 after the Ransom Home was destroyed by fire. The total hospital population at that time was 1,450 patients.
As newer types of psychotropic medications and other psychosocial rehabilitative approaches were found effective in the treatment of the mentally ill, the census of the hospital declined. The hospital was then assigned the responsibility for various other geographical areas in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Several new buildings were constructed: Hilltop East (originally a tuberculosis ward), Hilltop West (a geriatric building), a Recreation Hall, a Laundry Facility, and a Warehouse.
As the patient population declined, the hospital's Long Term Care Unit was closed in May 1998. Today the hospital has a bed capacity of 265, all of which are designated for adult psychiatric in-patient services.

Pennsylvania,Danville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Danville_State_Hospital,"April 13, 1868","August 26, 1869 (Rebuilt: 1881)",October 1872,Active and Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,John McArthur Jr.,Danville State Hospital for the Mentally Ill,"By an act of the Legislature approved April 13, 1868, a commission was appointed to select a site and erect a hospital for the insane for the northern section of the state, composed of the counties of Monroe, Carbon, Pike, Wayne, Susquehanna, Wyoming, Luzerne, Columbia, Montour, Sullivan, Bradford, Lycoming, Tioga, Clinton, Center, Clearfield, Elk, Cameron, McKean and Potter. Dr. J. A. Reed, superintendent of the Dixmont Hospital for the Insane, Dr. John Curwen, superintendent of the State Lunatic Hospital at Harrisburg, and Dr. Traill Green, of Easton, constituted this commission. After visiting a number of localities a farm of 250 acres was selected at Danville, Pa., at a cost of $26,600 of which the citizens of Danville had generously contributed $16,123.12. This farm was situated on the north branch of the Susquehanna River, about one mile east of Danville.
The commission appointed as superintendent of construction, Dr. S. S. Schultz, well known for his thorough knowledge of the treatment of the insane from his connection for many years with the State Lunatic Hospital at Harrisburg, his superior attainments as a physician, drawn from his experience of several years in the army and in private practice, and his excellent business qualifications.
The plan adopted by this commission, devised by John Mc Arthur, Jr., of Philadelphia, was the so-called Kirkbride system of connected wings, with a central administration building, 1143 feet in length, three stories in height, with three transverse wings on each side four stories in height, giving a capacity of 350 beds for each and accommodation for the necessary employees. The outer walls were constructed of stone procured from a quarry adjoining the property, stuccoed without, hand trowelled lime finish within, **ith brick partitions, hard-wood finish of Georgia pine, and slate roof, the construction being of the so-called slow-burning type. The building was fronted by a lawn of 45 acres, eventually laid out by Donald G. Mitchell, and, being on a slight eminence, overlooked the Susquehanna, which latter supplied the water and received the sewage.
It was determined to erect so much of the building as the appropriation would complete ready for occupancy. The administration building, with one wing and a transverse on each side, capable of accommodating 200 patients, with the necessary adjuncts of water, gas, heat, sewage, laundry, etc., was contracted for and building operations were immediately begun. The corner-stone was laid August 26, 1869, by Governor Geary, and an address appropriate to the occasion was delivered by Dr. Isaac Ray, of Philadelphia. Recognizing the need for further accommodation, there being but one other institution for indigent insane in the state, construction was proceeded with as rapidly as appropriations could be secured, and the section mentioned above was publicly announced to be ready for patients in October, 1872, while the carpenters were still engaged in the administration building. The first patient was received November 6 of the same year. The remaining two wings of the male department were completed in 1876, and those of the female department in 1879, and immediately occupied.
Upon March 4, 1881, fire was discovered in a dust flue of the female section adjoining the administration building. This flue, unfortunately partly a studded partition, opened from the basement to the roof and allowed the fire to advance until it destroyed all of the female department, the administration building, and one-third of the male wing. Out of 392 patients in the institution, the majority were in attendance upon a chapel exercise and were removed from the building to the laundry and other outhouses without casualty. A few of the men escaped and were either returned later or remained at home. The women were subsequently transferred to the Harrisburg and Warren hospitals. The remaining two wings of the male department not being damaged, the men, 198 in number, were returned to their old quarters, arrangements being made for a temporary kitchen, offices and living rooms for officers and their families.
The insurance, amounting to $209,000, together with an additional appropriation, was immediately available for reconstruction. In the main, the wards were repaired in conformity with the original design, but large bay extensions to each ward, metal cornices, fire walls between each roof division, separating the roof from the lower structure by the use of iron joists and brick arches, were added.
The administration portion was entirely rebuilt upon a new design and made practically fireproof. An amusement hall was added, the general kitchen, a one-story structure, connecting in the rear, and beyond this a two-story structure, the basement containing a refrigerator, bakery and employees' dining room; the second story a sewing room and general store room. This reconstruction was completed and the first woman patient was received January 23.1883
By an act of the Legislature approved May 8, 1883, the committee on Lunacy of the Board of Public Charities was created and given jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to the indigent insane, and, subsequently, by an act dated June 13, 1883, this committee was empowered, through the aid of the courts if necessary, to remove the indigent insane from almshouses and private residences to the state hospitals for the insane. Pursuant to this authority admissions to state institutions rapidly increased and in April, 1885, this institution was filled to its maximum, and since that time to the present has suffered from excessive overcrowding. Having reached a maximum of 901 patients, the first relief was gained by the removal of 135 patients from Philadelphia to the Norristown Hospital upon its opening in August, 1880; 113 patients were transferred to Blockley Hospital, Philadelphia; 35 patients were transferred to Harrisburg Hospital, properly belonging to that district; 50 women were transferred to Blockley Hospital, Philadelphia; 19 patients were transferred to the almshouse of the Middle Coal Field Poor District, by direction of the Committee on Lunacy; 128 patients were transferred to the Institution for Chronic Insane at Wernersville in 1894; 171 patients to the Retreat, the county insane hospital for the Central Poor District, Luzerne County, in 1900, and 371 patients to the State Homeopathic Hospital at Rittersville in 1912 and 1913. Notwithstand1ng these exceptional discharges, the greatest number resident on any one day reached 1727, an increase above the normal capacity that necessitated the use of many temporary beds. Enlargement of the plant in every department became a very evident necessity and an effort was made to secure additional buildings in 1890, which did not bear fruit until 1896, when a one-story wing, with a capacity of 50 beds, was erected at a cost of $20,000, to be occupied by infirm men. This rendered possible the first proper segregation of helpless, bedridden, terminal cases, although individual care had been attempted for a number of years in one of the main wards. The central building and an adjoining ward for a similar purpose were completed and occupied in July, 1900. An additional story was added to this building in 1909, making a total capacity of 230 men,
A nurses' home for women was completed in 1900. By removal of the nurses to these new quarters, 30 additional beds were secured for patients.
During 1904 the lavatory system was renewed. Four four-story fireproof buildings, erected outside the general line of the building, and connected with the wards by a 12-foot passage, with fixtures of a sanitary type, accommodated this department. By establishing dormitories in the rooms vacated by the old lavatory system, 164 beds were gained. Estimating the value of the added room at $500 per bed, the net cost to the state of this change did not exceed $12,000, but the sanitation secured and the abundance of room alone fully compensated for the outlay.
During 1906 the heating and lighting systems were completely renovated. The high-pressure gravity system of heating was changed to a low-pressure vacuum system. A new boiler house and electric light plant were built, four 330 horse power water-tube boilers were installed, ventilation was effected by electric-driven exhaust fans in the attic, three Thompson-Ryan dynamos were installed, and the building and grounds were wired for electric light. In addition, the electric power was utilized in many instances for mechanical purposes.
During 1909 two buildings for the treatment of acute cases, one for each sex, were constructed. These buildings, faced with buff brick, are two stories in height. The first floor, designed for acute and observation cases, is divided into a dormitory of 30 beds and 15 single rooms, with rooms for continuous bath, a complete hydriatic room in the basement, and a sun parlor and dining room. The second story, designed for epileptic cases, is divided into one large dormitory of 60 beds, seven single rooms, a day room and dining room, with the usual toilet rooms. The object sought was to have epileptic patients under surveillance night and day.
There was also constructed an infirmary building for women, two stories in height, containing five dormitories, sun porches, day rooms and dining room, with a capacity of 150 patients. The basement contains a kitchen to serve this building and the adjoining acute building. In the third story of the central part is located the operating room, with necessary adjuncts, and seven single rooms, now occupied by the night service of nurses.
These several additions have increased the normal capacity from joo to 1450 patients, or more than double the original capacity. The criterion of 100 cubic feet air space per patient is not the only essential in estimating capacity, but the rapidity with which the air can be changed to keep it pure. If this be taken into consideration, the capacity of the institution may be stated as 1600.
There have been provided also a dormitory of 46 rooms, reading and billiard rooms for men employed upon the grounds, and a series of four dwellings for heads of departments.
In 1004 a mechanical filter, with building to contain it, was installed for the purification of Susquehanna River water. Two :ilters and a settling tub, with necessary pumps, met the first requirements, but later two additional filter tubs were added.
Additions to the laundry building have been made upon three different occasions and modern machinery added as the requirements of the increasing population demanded.
During February, 1904, an effort was made to obviate the contamination of the Susquehanna River by sewage from the institution through its disposal by broad irrigation upon the fields. It was collected in a large basin and pumped through a long line of d1stributing pipe by an air-compressor pump. This system proved inadequate and was pronounced insanitary by the State Department of Health, and a system comprising sedimentation tanks, sprinkling filters, and final treatment by hypochlorite of lime was substituted. This required a new line of sewers to separate the sewage from storm water. Electrically driven rotary pumps operating in series now convey the sewage to the filter beds, the effluent being discharged into the Susquehanna River. Since its completion, April 23, 1910, weekly analyses have been made, showing perfect bacteriological purity.
Later acquisitions to the hospital include a cold storage plant, an industrial building for the use of men, an addition to the dairy barn, the enlargement of the reservoirs, a fire main and hydrants reaching the more important points, a railroad siding and coalstorage bins, coachman's, pumpman's and gate houses, etc.
The dairy barn has been twice burned by fires, presumably of incendiary origin, and rebuilt out of the proceeds of insurance.
To insure a better service, a training school for nurses, the first of its kind in Pennsylvania, was instituted in 1889. In its incipiency lectures on nursing and kindred subjects were given for a year and a half. Later the curriculum was reorganized to include lectures and bed-side recitations, each topic to be followed by examinations, the classes to be divided into a junior and a senior year, and the course was made obligatory. The first class graduated in 1893, and the total number of graduates is now 345. An advance in wages and positions of greater trust are given these graduates, of whom 108 remain in the service of the hospital.
With the better care made possible by the educated nurse, the proper segregation of patients, a more individual supervision and the advent of hydrotherapy, a new era has been achieved in the treatment of mental disorders. Seclusion is almost unknown, restraint reduced to a minimum, noise and confusion abated, death from acute exhaustion a rare occurrence, and the whole environment is rendered more normal. The bed-treatment of disturbed cases was begun tentatively in 1895 by the use of a ward entirely of single rooms usually occupied by refractory patients, and ill suited for the purpose. With proper facilities for carrying out this regime, the best good has been accomplished. An adequate force of reliable nurses is essential, and constant surveillance; the patient is given the greatest possible amount of rest, with hyper-nutrition, as long as any physical or mental necessity exists.
Since 1905 a dentist of Danville has visited the institution onehalf day each week to care for the teeth of the patients. Latterly these visits have been increased to two half days. Three surgeons of repute and an ophthalmologist are available when the necessity arises.
The card-index system of registration and clinical sheets, with folders, has been adopted, and an additional stenographer is employed to assist in the work. This system has proved advantageous because of its convenience and the resulting fuller and more accurate clinical histories.
One feature of the management is the retention of married graduated men nurses who have their homes in the adjoining town. They have leave of absence when off duty and at night. About one-third of the men nurses have availed themselves of this privilege and in this way competent men have been retained in the service many years, whose services would otherwise have been lost to the institution. As no nurses' home for men has been provided, it is proposed to start a village upon the hospital grounds, to give them buildings with more sanitary equipment and easier access to their work in the event of emergencies. A small appropriation has been secured by act of Legislature in furtherance of this object.
At the call of the president of the Board of Trustees, a number of representative trustees and superintendents convened at the hospital in October, 1903, to consider the organization of a society interested in the welfare of the insane. The organization effected is known as the Association of Trustees and Medical Superintendents of the State and Incorporated Hospitals for the Insane of Pennsylvania. The membership also includes the Committee on Lunacy and officers of institutions for the feeble-minded. Semiannual meetings are held at the various institutions, the program □eluding inspection of the hospital, the reading of papers and discussions pertaining to the scientific and economic care of the insane, ind a better acquaintance of those associated in this work.
The farm has been extended by purchases from time to time and the original 250 acres increased to 663. Thirty-five acres are occupied as a garden and 430 acres by actual drill measurement are used as the farm. A herd of 100 Holstein cows is usually maintained. During the fall of 1914 aphthous fever appeared among steers purchased for slaughter, with resulting contamination of the herd of cows, which were ordered killed by the state authorities. One hundred and ninety-five cows and all the swine were killed, and all infected stabling torn out and disinfected. An appropriation of $10,800 was made for the purchase of new stock and the restoration of stables.
In 1894 Auditor-General Gregg decided that any cash balance on hand must be deducted from the amount charged to the state, and in that year he wiped out a balance of $29,042.57 by deducting said amount from the hospital's claim against the state, thus leaving the institution without a working balance. Remittances are due, both from the poor district and state, at the end of the quarter of the state's fiscal year.
After a brief illness Dr. S. S. Schultz died September 27, 1891. Dr. H. B. Meredith, for 13 years an assistant physician under Dr. Schultz, was elected superintendent and physician, and is the present incumbent.[1]

Dr. Robert Gatski, Superintendent for 1955-1977, was the first to introduce chlorpromazine in the treatment of patients at Danville State Hospital. Since then, many new psychotropic medications have been developed. These medications have been successful in the treatment of mental illness and have facilitated the patients' placement back into the community.
In the 1950's the hospital received full approval of the Central Inspection Board of the American Psychiatric Association for excellence in patient care. The patient population showed a steady increase up to November 1955, when the figure reached 2,801. Since that time a gradual planned reduction has occurred. As a result the census in 1968 was 1,899, and on June 30, 2002, the hospital census stood at 147. This is in keeping with the modern philosophy of treating patients in the least restrictive setting. In 1976, a Long Term Care Facility (Licensed Nursing Home) was opened to address the needs of our geriatric patients who no longer were considered to be in need of psychiatric care. The Long Term Care Facility closed on May 12, 1998. With the state system downsizing and the closing of Harrisburg State Hospital, this hospital’s bed capacity increased to 180. With the consolidation effort, Danville State Hospital facilities are gradually being utilized to meet other community resource needs.
Over the past five years, much emphasis has been placed by this hospital on collaborating with county Mental Health Administrations to return individuals to the community. We work with them and assist them to divert admissions for people who can be served in a less restrictive setting. In addition, our hospital staff provides consultation on special needs populations and a myriad of training programs for community staff and providers.
In 1999, the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, under Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare, began an initiative to reduce the utilization of seclusion and restraint at the State Mental Hospitals. In adopting this initiative, Danville State Hospital has experienced success while continuing to provide a safe, effective, and collaborative treatment environment. On Nov. 30, 2004, Danville State Hospital became the first psychiatric hospital in Pennsylvania and the nation to go four years without the use of mechanical restraint. This achievement represents a significant milestone in the history of the hospital and the evolution of mental health treatment. Since 1985 this hospital has had full accreditation from the Joint Commission, Medicare and Medical Assistance. At our last Joint Commission survey, we received a three-year accreditation, which attests to the high quality of care given to all individuals entrusted to our care.[3]
As of Jan. 31, 2008, Danville State Hospital had 163 patients.[4]

There is one cemetery located on hospital grounds, it was used between the years of 1882 and 1939. According to old medical records there are 84 grave sites, most of which are unmarked. The sites that do have markers are marked with just numbers and not patient names. In 1987 a project was completed to restore the cemetery and erect a plaque in honor of those buried there. The cemetery is not open to the public. For further information please contact the hospital directly.[5]",,"Danville, PA",,"2,918 in 1947"
Pennsylvania,Dixmont State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dixmont_State_Hospital,"March 18, 1848",1859,1862,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,,Western Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane,"The Western Pennsylvania Hospital was founded in Pittsburgh in 1848 as a general hospital that treated all types of illnesses and became the first institution in western Pennsylvania to offer treatment for the insane. When the Insane Department of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital was moved to a new building in Kilbuck Township outside of Pittsburgh in 1862 it was renamed the Western Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane at Dixmont to honor the memory of Dorothea Dix, an advocate for reforming the treatment of mental patients. The Dixmont Hospital was legally separated from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in 1907 when it was individually incorporated as the Dixmont Hospital for the Insane. Supported by private contributions since 1852, it was primarily state appropriations that enabled the hospital to expand its facilities and care for an increasing number of mentally ill persons over the first nine decades of its existence. Despite receiving state appropriations, it nonetheless continued to operate as a private corporation until 1945 when it was taken over by the Department of Public Welfare. From that date, it operated under the name Dixmont State Hospital until it closed in July 1984.
The Western Pennsylvania Hospital was one of the earlier asylums built on the Kirkbride plan, with three crooked wings stretching to each side of administration; one wing for male and the other for female patients. By the end of the 1800's, the resident population grew to over 1,200 and a nursing school was established in 1895. As with most asylums, Dixmont became overcrowded to the point that it was not accepting new admissions. During the Great Depression, the hospital tried to sustain itself by paying employees only with room and board, not salaries, and sold any crafts made by patients for extra income. By 1946, the state had to step in, and the institution became known as Dixmont State Hospital.
Financial troubles still plagued the hospital until it finally closed in 1984. A fire partially destroyed the administration building, and the place was an easy target for anyone to do what they pleased. For 15 years the hospital sat decaying, until a contractor named Ralph Stroyne bought the property (whose many relatives worked at the institution), but it was sold again to the Wal-mart corporation, where they planned to raze the buildings for a new department store. Someone has (unofficially) informed me that there was a company who offered to restore the property but Wal-Mart? had deeper pockets ($35 million for 35 acres).
As of 2006, the hospital has been demolished. The precarious nature of the hill that it rested on proved to be a challenge for the developers - and eventually an engineering disaster. The demolition and clearing of the parcel atop the hill caused a massive landslide in September 2006, which dumped 500,000 cubic yards of soil, rock and debris onto Route 65, closing it to traffic for some time. One year later, Wal-mart finally abandoned the plans to develop the site.

This cemetery, still owned by the state, contains about 1300 graves with nothing but a number on a simple stone marking each sight. Most of the patients were buried in wicker coffins and pine boxes.

Pennsylvania,Embreeville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Embreeville_State_Hospital,"Sept 29, 1938 (As a PA State Hospital)",1898,1938,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Embreeville Complex | Chester County Poor House  | Chester County Almshouse,"This facility started out as the Chester County Almshouse in 1798, and was intended to care for the insane, poor, and neglected of the county. The commonwealth would later want counties to construct independent facilities that could provide care for the indigent insane and, beginning in 1898, work began on land where the ""new"" poorhouse would be located. The facility developed into a working community where able-bodied people earned their keep by performing a variety of tasks from farming to sewing, laundry and related chores. This new site would accommodate the growing need of the destitute in the region. Not far from the original poorhouse was a Potter’s Field, where less fortunate people without a family or means of support were buried. By 1900, patients from Norristown State Hospital were relocated to the new Embreeville asylum, which was functioning as a semi-autonmous hospital. Over time, additional modern buildings were constructed to house a growing mentally ill population. It was officially acquired by the state from Chester County in 1914.
On September 29, 1938 the commonwealth took total control of the facility as part of their new state-wide legislation, known as the ""Full State Care Act"". The legislature (Act #53) assumed responsibility for eight of the thirteen existing county public mental hospitals, the other five hospitals were closed. This same piece of legislation would transform sites like Philadelphia City Farms into Philadelphia State Hospital. It was designated that Embreeville would serve Lancaster and Chester County in Pennsylvania as part of their catchment area. Embreeville was cited by the American Psychiatric Association as one of three ""model hospitals"" in the country. Dr. Arthur Hecker, the hospital superintendent, upon hearing this honor stated ""We're naturally quite proud to be so honored by our peers... but we're even more pleased about a fact that helped make it possible. We have 100 percent turnover of beds each year.""
In 1971, a juvenile detention center was place within a few buildings at the hospital site, before finally moving on to better physical accommodations in Danville in 1992. By 1979, the total statewide state hospital census was reduced to 10,573 patients, and resulted in the closure of several smaller state hospitals. Embreeville was the second state facility in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to close its doors, in 1980, following that of Hollidaysburg State Hospital.
In the wake of its closure, outpatient clinics were established through Fellowship Human Resources in Phoenixville, PA (BSU# 151), Human Services Inc. in Downingtown, PA (BSU# 152), and Creative Health Services in Spring City, PA (BSU# 153). These clinics are largely county funded, and are intended to treatment the mentally ill on an outpatient basis, in lieu of the former regional state hospital.
For the better part of the three decades the site of Embreeville stood abandoned, the physical site slowly deteriorating because of the commonwealth's neglect. The area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and as of December 2012, Hellings Holdings LLC was awarded the 225-acre former  hospital property for an asking price of $950,000. According to the developer plans for the land include residential development with some commercial zoning. However, because of the property’s location, commercial development plans call for certain necessary amenities which have yet to be established.
The potter's field (now part of the Cheslen Preserve and clearly noted on hiking trails), where impoverished patients were buried, is outside of the hospital grounds and has a sign marked by the local government. The wooden sign there on the site bears the inscription ""Known but to God, respected by us"", in clear reference to the anonymity of the graves on-site. Two-hundred and four lonely charcoal grey stone tablets remain there in the field, honoring the lives of the forgotten poor, which left this life unknown to the rest of humanity.

Pennsylvania,Farview State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Farview_State_Hospital,"May 11, 1905",1912,1913,Active,Cottage Plan,Charles Hillman,State Hospital for the Criminal Insane | State Correctional Institution at Waymart (SCI Waymart) (Current),"Farview was founded by an act of the state legislature on May 11, 1905 as the first and only institution in the state devoted exclusively to the care and treatment of the criminally insane. It was located on a 950 acre tract of land just west of Waymart on land donated to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by the Delaware & Hudson Railroad. Over the years additional land was purchased adding another 450 acres to the property. The site had been the Farview Picnic Ground used by the D&H Gravity Railroad excursion rides. The location is one of the highest elevations in the state and the name is derived from the spectacular view from that spot. Dr. Thomas C. Fitzsimmons was appointed the first superintendent of the hospital and construction continued between 1908 and 1913 with the first patients arriving in December 1912.
In 1913 the number of patients was 171 and by 1960 it had risen to 1,401. Farview was intended to function as a prison without walls. The design grouped the large brick buildings together with connecting passageways that enclosed a courtyard. This restricted the patients' access only to the courtyards and the interior of the buildings. J.C. M. Shirk of Philadelphia designed and constructed the original buildings and his partner, Charles L. Hillman, designed and built the later buildings after Shirk's death in 1918. The complex included the main hospital, dormitory, and a dining hall for the patients plus an industrial building where they manufactured various items. It also included the administrative building, superintendent's residence, a guard dormitory, staff cottages, kitchens, workshop, laundry and 43 acre farm.
Farview was representative of a development in the treatment of the criminally insane known as institutional peonage. This was the practice of having patients provide labor to help offset costs for the facility while giving the patients manual work that would instill a feeling of self-worth and employ their time productively. By 1914, an additional 100 acres had been cleared for crops which included potatoes, cabbage, turnips, tomatoes, beans, carrots and parsnips. In the first year of operation the farm had a bull, 20 cows, 10 calves, 50 pigs and 100 chickens. By 1920 the farm comprised 307 acres and beef cattle, sheep and a small herd of deer for venison were added to the livestock. The property also included orchards, vineyards and a berry patch.
An occupational therapy program was established in 1920, which included various types of industrial arts such as brick making, weaving, knitting, printing, laundering and baking. The facility also provided various amusements for the patients such as baseball, movies, pool and checkers. The hospital even had a band. 
Many changes took place over the years. A dairy barn was erected about 1920 and additional structures were added as the need arose. The dairy barn was destroyed in a fire set by one of the patients but a more up-to-date barn was built to replace it with every bit of the wood and every brick used in the construction coming from the hospital property.
As of 2008 Farview State Hospital is owned by the PA Dept of Corrections and is known as the State Correctional Institution at Waymart. Pressed into operation ahead of schedule following the Camp Hill riot, the joint on-site operation of a state prison and state mental health facility was unique. In October 1995, Farview State Hospital was transferred from the Department of Public Welfare to the Department of Corrections. Now known as the department's Forensic Treatment Unit, the unit houses mentally disabled male inmates who require inpatient psychiatric care and treatment. The institution also houses minimum-security inmates. Inmate stats as of 2005: 1,322 minimum-security inmates / Sex offenders housed: 675 / Average age of prisoner: 47

Cottage Plan 1900-2006","Kirkbride Building: John Haviland
Cottage Plan Buildings: Addison Hutton & John Dempwolf",Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital & Union Asylum for the Insane | City On The Hill (unofficial),"The establishment of a hospital for the relief of the insane poor of the state claimed the attention of the philanthropic at an early date. The first movement was made by the citizens of Philadelphia, who adopted a memorial which they presented to the Legislature at the session of 1838-39. A bill authorizing the erection of a state lunatic hospital was prepared and passed both houses, but did not receive the sanction of the Governor. Subsequently an act was passed March 4, 1841, authorizing the Governor to appoint three commissioners to select a site and superintend a suitable building for the purpose. The spot selected was on the Schuylkill River, two miles from Gray's Ferry, below Philadelphia. Preparations were made for commencing the erection of the building, when operations were suspended.
The subject was not permitted to rest, but was kept before the public until, in 1844, Miss Dorothea L. Dix, having visited and examined the almshouses and jails throughout the state, presented to the Legislature a memorial setting forth the condition of the insane and urging upon the members the necessity and duty of providing some means for their treatment and proper maintenance.
Acting in accordance with these suggestions, the Legislature in the spring of 1845 appointed five commissioners as follows: Jacob M.Haldeman (who served until 1848 and then withdrew), Luther Reily, Hugh Campbell, Charles B. Trego and Joseph Konigmacher, to select and purchase a tract of land for a hospital site, of not less than 100 acres, situated within ten miles of Harrisburg, and not to cost more than $10,000; to contract for the building and furnishing of a hospital that should be plain and substantial, with all modern improvements, to accommodate 250 patients; for which building the sum of $50,000 was appropriated. The hospital was to be called the Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital and Union Asylum for the Insane.
The commissioners not feeling authorized to enter upon their duties until further action by the Legislature, a supplementary act was passed in the spring of 1848 by which the name of the hospital was changed to Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital, and the names of Aaron Bombaugh, John A. Weir and James Fox were added to the list of commissioners. Fifty thousand dollars was specifically appropriated to be paid by the State Treasurer on warrants drawn by the Governor in favor of the commissioners; not more than one-third of the sum to be drawn in any one year. The Governor was to appoint nine persons to be trustees of the hospital. This act was signed by Governor F. S. Shunk April 11, 1848. In pursuance to the act of Assembly, a farm of 130 acres, situated about a mile and a half north of Harrisburg, was purchased and work commenced in the summer of 1848, according to the plan furnished by John Haviland, architect, of Philadelphia, to whom was given also the contract for the erection of the building. The corner-stone was laid by Governor Johnston April 7, 1849, and the buildings delivered to the commissioners June 19, 1851. No accommodation having been provided in the original plan for the violent and noisy classes of insane, a contract was made with Messrs. Holman & Simon, of Harrisburg, for the erection of buildings for these classes, on which work was commenced early in the summer of 1851.
On the 14th of February, 1851, the trustees appointed by the Governor in January, 1851—Luther Reily, M. D., Aaron Bombaugh, John K. Mitchell, M. D., Joseph Konigmacher, Jesse R. Burden, M. D., Hugh Campbell, M. D., Thomas S. Kirkbride, M. D., W. W. Rutherford, M. D., and E. W. Roberts, M. D.— assembled at Coverly's Hotel, Harrisburg. They elected as officers of the board: President, Luther Reily, M. D.; secretary, Aaron Bombaugh; and treasurer, John A. Weir. As the hospital was nearly finished and it was deemed necessary to have some one on the premises to attend to the final arrangements for the admission of patients, Dr. John Curwen, of Philadelphia, was elected superintendent, with a salary of $1500 per year.
The main building was so far completed as to be placed under the control of the board October 1, 1851, and after that time suitable cases were received. As the wards for the violent and noisy insane, for which appropriation was made by the Legislature, session of 1850-51, were unfinished, admissions were restricted to those who could be accommodated in a proper manner. Thirty seven patients were received by the end of the year 1851, the first one having been admitted on the 6th of October.
The officers of the hospital consisted of a superintendent, one assistant physician, a steward and a matron. The rate of board for patients supported by the public authorities was fixed at $2 per week, the remaining sum necessary for their support to be paid by a special appropriation from the State Treasury. The minimum charge for private patients was $3 per week, which it was thought would be sufficient when the hospital should be in running order.
The hospital was composed of the central or administration building, with wings extending in a linear direction on each side, each wing so arranged that the second projection receded 20 feet behind the first; and the third 20 feet behind the second; so that both ends might be open to receive ventilation and light. The central building had three floors above the basement or ground floor, a large Tuscan portico with a flight of 20 steps to the main entrance, and was surmounted by a large dome. In the basement, three steps above the ground, were the apartments for steward and matron, the kitchens, etc. On the main floor were offices and reception rooms for visitors. On the second floor were the apartments for the superintendent, and on the third the chapel, occupying the front of the building, and to the rear of it six bedrooms. The wings immediately adjoining the central building were three stories in height, the lower story or basement containing accommodations for those employed in kitchens, etc., and for the workmen. In the second and third stories were wards for the patients; these had long corridors with rooms on either side. The second projection of each wing was of three stories and had a ward on each floor. At the point of junction of the first and second projections and raised one story above them was an infirmary. The third projection of each wing, which was composed of two stories, was for the violent and noisy patients. These projections were completed in 1852 and increased the capacity of the hospital to 300.
Eighty feet to the rear of the central structure was the building ior bakery and laundry. In the cellar of this were the boilers for generating steam for warming the hospital, etc., with room for storing 150 tons of coal. The steam coils (hung on wooden brackets) for heating were placed in air ducts which ran under the entire length of the building connected with shafts to bring in fresh air from without; this impinging on the coils became heated and passed through flues into the various parts of the building. The hospital was lighted with gas supplied by the Harrisburg Gas Company.
The experience of the first winter proved the heating and ventilating system to be insufficient and unsatisfactory. Various changes and additions to it were made each year, but without much result, until in 1871 a fan system of ventilation was installed. A building for fans and engines was erected about 200 feet in the rear of the main building; two fans were used; these, driven by engines, sent the air through arched underground passages into the air chambers under the entire length of the building, where were the steam radiators. From these chambers air was carried by flues into every room in the house. This was found to be a great improvement on the old way.
Much trouble was experienced in the early days from an insufficient water supply. In 1853 an attempt was made to furnish water from an artesian well, but after a few years this proved inadequate, and in 1856 new water works were erected, in connection with which was a sand filter bed. The water came from the stream on the grounds and the house was supplied with clear water as long as the filter bed was kept in working order. In 1883 an eight-inch well 695 feet deep was driven at the place of the old artesian well. In 1884 a well was dug near the old water works in order to supplement the supply of the artesian well. This well water was the cause of constant trouble, and dysentery and typhoid fever prevailed for a number of years, until, by sinking the artesian well to a greater depth there was a supply of artesian water sufficient for drinking purposes. In 1899 two sand filter beds of 400,000 gallons daily capacity were constructed near the creek, and pipe connection made so that either creek or artesian well water could be used at will. In time of drought this supply was insufficient, as the hospital plant was increasing in size; connection was made therefore with the city main, but the expense of the city water proved almost prohibitive. When, therefore, in 1909 the Susquehanna Water Company piped the water of Swatara Creek to the boundaries of the grounds, the hospital laid pipe connections by which they connected their water works with the chemically filtered water of this company. This water passes through the hospital sand filters and is delivered to the house with 99 per cent of the bacteria removed. The supply has proved highly satisfactory and is still in ^(1914).
From the beginning of its history Miss Dix always showed a great interest in the hospital and its inmates. She collected a fund from the citizens of Philadelphia for the benefit of the patients; with this she furnished them with a bowling alley, two buildings tor reading rooms and museums, horses and carriage, magic lanterns with slides, musical instruments, books, etc. In consideration of the great services rendered by her the board, to show its appreciation, in 1853 authorized the superintendent to receive and treat without charge any one person recommended for admission by Miss Dix. One patient recommended by her entered the hospital March 6, 1853, and remained until her death in 1895. After the death of Miss Dix the trustees of the Philadelphia fund presented the hospital with her life-size portrait; this portrait is now in the administration building of the hospital.
A commission, provided by an act of Legislature, 1852, recommended that eight of the insane criminals in the Eastern Penitentiary be transferred to this hospital. These were received in February, 1853, but in spite of the utmost vigilance four of them escaped. They proved very undesirable for the institution and tenonstrated the necessity of some better provision for their care and safekeeping. No adequate provision was made, however, until IQI3. when the Hospital for Criminal Insane was opened at Farview.
The hospital had opened with the price of board for public patients at $2 per week. In 1854 it was raised to $2.50. In 1859 an act of Legislature enabled the hospital to collect outstanding debts from a number of the counties. In 1883 the charge was $3 per week. In 1907 it was increased from $3.75 to $4.25 per week, according to an act of Legislature by which the counties contribute $1.75 per week and the state supplies the balance ($2.50) ior the care and maintenance of each patient or as much thereof as is expended.
During the Civil War, when Camp Curtin was located near the hospital (1861-62), much assistance was rendered to the soldiers of the camp. A number of cases of sickness among the recruits which could not be cared for otherwise were received into the hospital. Thousands of pounds of beef and ham were cooked and hundreds of gallons of coffee made for the soldiers, articles for the sick were prepared and the soldiers allowed the use of bath rooms and laundry.
After the first few years of its existence the hospital suffered much inconvenience from overcrowding. In 1856 the opening of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane at Dixmont temporarily relieved the congestion. In 1861 it was found necessary for the first time to ask some of the counties to take charge of certain patients who had been sent to the hospital, or of others to whom the hospital was not likely to be of any benefit except as a home. In 1867 such was the pressure that it was necessary to give public notice that only recent cases would be received. In 1872 the opening of the hospital at Danville afforded relief, but on account of the great demand for admission it was still necessary to refuse those who had been insane for a long time. In 1880, 75 patients of the southeastern district were removed to the newly opened hospital at Norristown. In 1882-83 the population was greatly augmented by the admission of about 100 patients from the Danville Hospital, which had been destroyed by fire, and by patients from the insane departments of the Lancaster and Dauphin County almshouses, which had suffered the same fate. In 1883 the Committee on Lunacy was authorized to transfer to state hospitals the insane inmates of any of the county poorhouses wherever in its judgment they could be better cared for in the state institutions. The authors of this humane law hardly realized the magnitude of the task upon the committee. The inadequacy of the state hospitals for the custodial care of the insane at that time and for the next 20 years was not realized and the hospitals soon became overcrowded with a class of incurable inmates. They filled the wards of the hospital to the exclusion of those recent cases of insanity that could be benefited by early treatment. When the overcrowding of the hospital became so excessive that the Board of Trustees was compelled, for the protection of their patients, to decline to receive inmates, it was difficult to make provisions for their care elsewhere. Realizing this condition of affairs, the Legislature in 1891, at the suggestion of the Board of Charities, passed a law authorizing the board to re-transfer, at their discretion, any or all patients from the state hospitals to the county houses. At the same session a bill relegating the chronic insane to the county almshouses and appropriating a large sum for their care and maintenance therein was, very properly, vetoed by Governor Pattison. The unforeseen delays in the finishing of the State Asylum for the Chronic Insane compelled the State Board of Charities to avail themselves of the provisions of the law of 1891 and transfer the overplus in the hospitals to the almshouses. This relief and the closing of the doors to patients (authorized by the trustees) from February 18 to June 2, 1893, reduced the number of patients in the hospital so that they could be cared for properly. In 1894 a number of patients was transferred to the State Asylum for the Chronic Insane, but in 1895, 75 01 these patients were re-transferred from that asylum and from the county almshouses, thus again overcrowding the hospital to a dangerous extent. In 1885 the capacity of the hospital had been increased by 300 beds by the erection of two buildings (for chronic insane), and in 1901 by the completion of a building for 200 feeble patients. In 1902, on account of imperative demand for accommodation, it was decided to crowd 900 beds 1nto the hospital which was designed for the accommodation of only 600. Because of the dangers from overcrowding the trustees had persistently maintained their rights to fix the number of patients who might be safely treated in the hospital, and because they refused at times to admit patients they were severely criticised. It was thought wise therefore to submit to the Attorney General the question of the rights of the trustees in this respect. In the opinion of the Attorney General, handed down May 20, 1903, the trustees were advised that the provisions of the several acts of Assembly which govern the question "" undoubtedly confer upon the trustees a right to fix the number of patients whom they may safely treat, and invest the trustees with a general discretion in the matter."" Thus advised, the board decided to receive only such commitments thereafter as were ordered by the several courts. In 1906 the erection of temporary buildings for women gave some relief, as their new quarters were not yet built. In 1910, after the completion of all the wards, which provided for 1000 patients, there were 1251 patients being treated. In 1913 1378 were under treatment. Conditions were somewhat improved in this year by the removal of patients to the Hospital for Criminal Insane at Farview and the Hospital for the Insane at Rittersville, both newly opened. The opening of the Schuylkill County Hospital for the Insane caused the transfer of 186 patients in 1914, leaving the number of patients under treatment in June, 1914, 1278.
During its 63 years of existence the hospital has had but three superintendents. Dr. John Curwen was the first superintendent, and served three terms of ten years each, from February 14, 1851, to February 14, 1881. He had held a position as assistant physician in the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane in Philadelphia, from 1844 until 1849. February 14, 1851, he was elected superintendent of this hospital.
In 1881 Dr. J. Z. Gerhard, who had been assistant physician under Dr. Curwen for eleven years, was elected superintendent. At the expiration of his term in 1891 he declined to apply for reelection and entered private practice in Harrisburg. The work done during his administration, in addition to many minor improvements, consisted of the construction of a lake with an ice house 20 x 60 feet at its head; the purchase of 55 acres of land in order properly to locate two new buildings for the chronic patients, which buildings were completed in 1886; the building of a boiler house and laundry; enlargement of the barn and increase in water works. In 1891 the attendants were uniformed.
Dr. Henry L. Orth, of Harrisburg, was elected to the position made vacant by the retirement of Dr. Gerhard, taking up his duties as superintendent November 1, 1891, which position he now holds.
The hospital had opened in 1851, with a superintendent, John Curwen, M. D., and one assistant physician, William R. DeWitt. Jr., M. D. In 1855 tne trustees authorized the appointment of a second assistant physician. On the 8th of July, 1880, under the power conferred by the act of Assembly entitled, "" An Act for the Better Regulation and Treatment of the Female Insane in the Asylums and Hospitals of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,"" approved the 4th of June, 1879, tne trustees elected Margaret A. Cleaves, M. D., of Davenport, Iowa, to have medical control of the female patients, and Jane K. Garver, M. D., to be her assistant. Dr. Cleaves served for a term of three years and declined re-election. Dr. Garver was appointed in her place September, 1883, and served in that position until her death in October, 1902. In August, 1883, because of friction between the superintendent and women physicians, the trustees passed a resolution giving the superintendent the power to employ and discharge all attendants in the hospital, and required the physician in charge of the women's wards to report to the superintendent, as did the first assistant of the men's wards. In 1903 the trustees, convinced that greater efficiency would result in the administration by placing entire direction of the medical staff upon the superintendent, amended the bylaws to effect this change. The by-laws now provide for a superintendent, who shall be a skillful physician, one first assistant male physician and three assistant physicians, two of whom shall be women.
In 1873 a contract was made by the trustees with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company authorizing said company to construct their road through the hospital grounds, 650 feet from the nearest building. The company failed to avail themselves of the authority therein granted within five years and thus lost their right to enter in and take possession.
In 1881-83 the original building was examined by experts to consider the advisability of introducing an improved and safe method of heating. They found that this could not be done without a total reconstruction, which would cost about as much as a new building. A joint committee, consisting of two members of the Senate and three of the House, was appointed, with the approval of the Governor, to examine and report to the House the condition of the hospital buildings and the propriety of the erection of new ones. Their report was submitted April 20, 1883, to the effect "" that the buildings were defective in many particulars, were originally erected without any cellars, and although subsequent excavations had been made, they were totally without light or ventilation."" In consideration of the great expense that would be required to put these buildings in proper order, they recommended that new buildings be erected at a probable cost of $500,000 *nd that the Legislature then appropriate $100,000 for the commencement of said buildings. No appropriation was made for the purpose until 1885, when $80,000 was appropriated for two buildings, one for men and one for women. These buildings were finished in 1886. They each contain accommodations for 152 patients, and are connected with the center of the plant by long corridors. On the first floor of each are two large day rooms and singk and double bed rooms; on the second are two large dormitories with a few smaller bed rooms. One-half of the basement of each building was fitted up temporarily as a dining room, and these dining rooms still continue in use.
In 1887 $45,000 was appropriated for a new boiler house, to be located near the new wards on the south side. This contained on the lower floor boiler room, coal vault, machine shop, etc., on the upper floor the laundry, and on the third floor rooms for the employees. In 1892 a $10,000 electric light plant was installed, the dynamos being placed in the boiler house.
In 1893, through the recommendation of the Board of Public Charities, the Legislature appropriated $100,000 for rebuilding the central portion of the main building. This (the administration building) was the first of a series of buildings arranged on the cottage system, the general plan being drawn up by Addison Hutton, architect, under the direction of Dr. Orth, the superintendent, to replace the buildings erected in 1850. These buildings, a description of which follows, are practically finished (in 1914) and all old buildings removed, but there is still much grading, filling in and planting to be done before the grounds are in order. Money was appropriated for new buildings by the various sessions of the
This, with appropriations for filter plant, sewage disposal plant, increased boiler capacity, tearing down of buildings, grading, furnishing and equipment of new buildings, etc., which amount to $174,500, brings the cost of the new plant to $1,145,500, exclusive of the cost of labor of patients and regular hospital employees.
The plant comprises an administration building 54 x 126 feet; eight wards, each two stories in height, two of these for convalescent patients, two for dangerous patients, two for chronic patients, two psychopathic wards; one ward one story in height for feeble men and women patients; and two buildings for nurses. The buildings are so placed as to form a quadrangle or court 800 by 1000 feet, faced west by south, with the administration building on the western front and the building for feeble and harmless patients on the east; the kitchen, assembly hall and large sun parlor in the center, connected with all the buildings by semi-subways for water, steam and electric piping, and for passage for food cars. All buildings are of fireproof construction and so planned that every room in the plant is supplied with one or more windows; electricity is used for lighting and in many cases for cooking. The food can be delivered to any ward in the house within three minutes from the kitchen. The vacuum system of heating is used and the house is thoroughly warmed by indirect radiation with one pound of steam pressure. The psychopathic wards, constructed with hydrotherapeutic and electrical apparatus and operating rooms, equipped with the latest and best instruments of precision, give facilities for examining and treating patients in accordance with modern scientific methods.
A slight summary of the work of 24 years, from 1891 to 1914, will give an idea of the reconstruction and changes which have taken place in that time. All old buildings have been demolished, and a new hospital, fully equipped with all modern appliances for the treatment of disease, has arisen. Dysentery and typhoid fever lave been eradicated. There is a bacteriological laboratory with latest appliances, a sand filter that removes habitually 99 per cent oacterial life from the water supply, and a sewage filter with an efficiency of 88 per cent whose effluent is delivered into the Harristwg intercepting sewer. One hundred and thirty acres of land Have been added to the farm, increasing it to 420 acres; a large silo has been erected; a new pig pen built; an electric light plant of 250 kw. has taken the place of gas; new boilers of 1070 horsepower capacity have been installed; the exhaust system of heating has been introduced with satisfactory results. The cow stables have been renovated in order to give partial protection to the cows from tuberculosis. The cows are tested yearly with tuberculin. The patients have increased in numbers from 803 in 1891 to 1372 in 1914, about 70 per cent; the officers and employees from 156 to 247, about 59 per cent. At the same time the annual expenditures for officers and employees have risen from $45,899, or $59.65 per capita, to $90,644, or $71.65 per capita, an increase of but 21 per cent, while the whole per capita cost was increased 25 per cent, namely, expenditures in 1891, $139,995.52; in 1911, $267,274.90. With the increased acreage of arable land from 143 acres in 1891 to 273 acres in 1911, the farm and garden yielded products worth $57,927.34 in 1914, as compared with $12,957.99 m 1891.
Probably the most interesting event of the term was the opening of the newly completed assembly hall on Christmas Day, 1913. This hall is 90 feet in length by 60 feet in width, with a stage 40 feet by 18 feet, with necessary scenery; a gallery 50 feet by 20 feet for organ and moving-picture booth; the roof is arched, leaving the auditorium free from supporting columns. For 20 years the hospital was deprived of opportunities to hold religious services and give entertainments for the pleasure of or profit to its inmates. Occasionally religious services were held in crowded wards by members of the Harrisburg Ministerial Association, who voluntarily gave their services. Now religious services are held weekly by the representatives of the Protestant and Catholic denominations; dances, moving picture exhibitions, accompanied by interpretations of the best music, and other entertainments of various kinds.
Regular employment is furnished for the patients wherever possible. The women work in the wards, in the dining rooms and kitchen, in the laundry and sewing-room, all the clothing for the women patients being made in the hospital. The men work in the dairy, farm and garden, at the stone quarry, in grading and keeping the lawns in order; in shoe shop, butcher shop, bakery, etc.[1]
The early 20th century was a time of great change for Harrisburg State Hospital. The Main Building had become old and was in need of replacement. Between the years 1893 and 1912 the hospital was rebuilt following the ""Cottage Plan"", which became popular at the beginning of the 20th century. At its peak the hospital consumed over 1,000 acres (4.0 km²) and included more than 70 buildings. Designed and constructed by Pennsylvania architects Addison Hutton and John Dempwolf the campus and buildings were meant to represent an Italianate window. The buildings on the male and female sides of the campus mirrored each other until the addition of new buildings in the 1930s.
In 1921 the name of the hospital was changed to the Harrisburg State Hospital. Also that year, the Board of Public Charities was abolished and the Department of Public Welfare was created to administer all state hospitals. With the completion of the new ""Cottage Plan"" buildings, the hospital had grown considerably larger. Its patient capacity was 2,019, but at one time it held as many as 2,441 with 437 on parole. The hospital was self-sufficient with its own farm, power plant, and stores; it became known as the ""City on the Hill"". During war time there was a 50% shortage of attendants, at the lowest level of employment there were as few as one nurse to 166 patients. In June of 1945 only 26 of the 92 authorized positions on the male side were filled. The manpower shortage resulted in widespread curtailment of services to both the public and patients.
Up until 1955 certain administrative responsibilities, such as the selection of the hospital Superintendent and the enactment of rules and regulations governing the hospital were vested in the Board of Trustees of the Harrisburg State Hospital. In 1955 an amendment to the Administrative Code authorized the Department of Public Welfare to assume administrative responsibilities for the Harrisburg State Hospital, relegating its Board of Trustees to specific advisory duties. This act also provided for the appointment of a Commissioner of Mental Health in the Department of Public Welfare who assumed overall responsibility for Pennsylvania's mental health program.
Like other institutions Harrisburg State Hospital’s patient population began to fall in the late 20th century. This was due to new medicines being developed and finally deinstitutionalization. The hospital was finally closed on January 27, 2006. Today (2008) the hospital sits on a two hundred acre campus with stately buildings in a country setting, in Dauphin County, with a majority of its campus in Susquehanna Township. There are over fifty buildings still located on the campus. The former hospital facility now provides office space for many state agencies.[2]

In 1999 Harrisburg State Hospital was used for the hospital setting in the film, Girl, Interrupted. The majority of the film was shot in the Male Convalescent Building and the Administration Building. Other various locations in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania were also used. The Harrisburg State Hospital settings were meant to resemble those of the grounds of McLean Hospital in Massachusetts. The hospital was still an active Pennsylvania state hospital during the filming of the movie. Some of the props created for the movie still remain at the hospital today, like the ""Administration"" signs that still hang in the carport in front to the Administration Building.
In 2008 Harrisburg State Hospital was used as the setting for a movie called Another Harvest Moon. The movie was filmed in the Hilltop Building. The story is set in a retirement home where the main character has survived a stroke and is reconciling living in a new way than he's accustomed to living. (As of January 2011 this movie has not been released)
In May of 2010 the TV Series Ghost Lab filmed an episode at the hospital. The episode which was name ""The Morgue"" aired on the Discovery Channel on December 11, 2010.
There are three known locations that were used to bury deceased patients of Harrisburg State Hospital. After the hospital opened in 1851 the Harrisburg City Cemetery was used. Later on two cemeteries were established on the hospital grounds. Detailed information can be found here

Pennsylvania,Haverford State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Haverford_State_Hospital,"July 20, 1953","June 13, 1961",1962,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"The Haverford State Hospital was a state psychiatric facility outside of Philadelphia, PA., which operated between 1962 and 1998. Its construction was intended to alleviate overcrowding in neighboring Norristown State Hospital, Embreeville State Hospital and Philadelphia State Hospital, all of which were nearly a century old at the time of its construction. However, it was built during the final period of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's financial support of inpatient mental health centers. When it opened, it boasted modern clinical psychiatric care, which stood in startling contrast to its neighboring state hospitals. Its closure three decades later was due in part to a lawsuit from the 'Americans With Disabilities Act', as well as the growth of deinstitutionalization of state hospitals. When it closed, most of its clinical population was then transferred to Norristown. The property of the former hospital has been reclaimed by the local community.
On July 20, 1953, Pennsylvania governor John S. Fine signed into law the construction of a new psychiatric hospital. The original time estimate for its construction was 1956. However, due to roadblocks thrown up by neighbors and the resistance of local interest groups, it was delayed until June 13, 1961, and did not open until October of 1962. Its first superintendent, Dr. Jack Kremens, stated that his goal was to make this facility state of the art, with the intention of leading the industry in providing superior patient care. However, his ambitions were severely limited by the small size of Haverford, and the era in which it first opened its doors. During its tenure as an active state psychiatric site, it was renowned for the body of clinical research it produced. A number of studies were completed, in association with the University of Pennsylvania, which involved the inpatient population directly. These studies usually ranged into a variety of subjects, but are still used by the psychiatric and professional psychological community. One of the most enduring of these studies was one linking schizophrenia to ongoing tobacco use.
When Haverford State Hospital was built, it was designed to be a model of luxury care for the mentally ill. Haverford State was known by some of the locals as the ""Haverford Hilton"", and sometimes the ""Haverford Country Club"", because of the expense that went into its construction and maintenance. The physical site itself boasted a four-lane bowling alley, a soda fountain, a pool and billiards room, and private rooms for each of its patients. It possessed a library containing 4,000 volumes for the access of the patient population. There was a 12,4000 sq.ft. therapy room dedicated exclusively to occupational and industrial therapy opportunities. At its opening, it had no locked doors, with the exception of its Acute Care Unit, which was quite unlike neighboring state hospitals. The wards became smaller as greater emphasis was placed on the quality of patient care.
The Admissions building, which was the only building visible from the road, was the most iconic. The top three floors of this building were reserved for acute cases-one male and one female. Each of these locked wards had independent cafeterias and day rooms. There was also a barbershop for the men, and a hair salon for the women, available to all high acuity patients during the day. As hospital protocol, it was in the staff's best interest not to keep patients on the acute ward more than ninety days. Those patients that were unable to be placed in a lower level of care were transferred to a smaller long-term acute care building on the grounds.
However, despite these aspirations and the best intentions of physicians, over the next decade Haverford became overcrowded, and clinical conditions declined significantly. With the overcrowding, hospital staff were forced to attempt to accommodate the rising hospital population. Private rooms quickly became a thing of the past, as patients' beds were set up in hallways, day rooms, or any other available space.
In 1986, a rash of elopements brought the hospital into the media spotlight. By June of that year, about eighty patients had found a way to escape,  including some of whom were potentially dangerous. The public was shaken when 25-year-old mental patient, Raymond Tillger, walked off the hospital grounds on the sixth of June, and disappeared into the community. Shortly thereafter, his girlfriend was found dead by his hands. However, following a lengthy trial, Tillger was found not guilty for the 1979 slaying of his girlfriend, by 'reason of insanity'. He was arrested at the 'La Casa Pasta restaurant' in New Castle, eight days after his escape. ""It is not an understatement to say that Haverford State Hospital presents a time bomb waiting to explode,"" wrote State Rep. Stephen Freind, after the incident. ""It is only a matter of either divine providence or complete luck that thus far one of the walkaways has not seriously harmed or killed one of my constituents residing in the area or, for that matter, in any other area."" Freind was appalled that as a minimum security institution, Haverford State was housing potentially dangerous patients, and began pushing the state for stronger security measures. It was a case of negligence on the part of the hospital staff, he said. ""When I have frequently complained to the Director of the Hospital, Dr. Fong, he has used his standard procedure, namely waving his hands in the air and pleading helplessness,"" wrote Freind, calling on the attorney general to launch a grand jury investigation.
A year later, the dangerously overcrowded conditions at Haverford State again came under serious fire. In 1987 the hospital was operating at 141 percent of capacity, according to an Associated Press story, with 123 patients packed into wards designed to hold only 87. State officials and hospital administrators fought over whether to transfer patients to other hospitals or to increase funding in order to open two unused wards at Haverford State. Local officials were outraged when the state proposed to transfer long-term patients to other facilities and stop bringing new acutely ill patients to the facilities. ""It's very sick people leaving Delaware County, going away from their families, away from their friends,"" Sandra Cornelius, Director of the Delaware County Department of Human Resources, told the Associated Press in June 1987. In July of 1987 state officials negotiated to open 34 additional beds in the hospital to relieve some of the worst overcrowding, according to a press release from Freind's office. But the hospital management did not escape hot water for long. In July, 1988, a heat wave caused temperatures in some of the non-air conditioned hospital buildings to soar to as high as 115 degrees, according to Freind and state Rep. Mary Ann Arty. The lawmakers told the head of the state welfare department that air conditioners installed in the hospital lobbies were a temporary fix, subsequently demanding central air for the buildings.
Despite efforts to control the overcrowding and to improve conditions, they continued to worsen. The hospital failed a Medicare inspection in July of 1987 because of nursing shortages. It passed a second inspection in November 1987 by moving the Medicare patients to well-staffed wards, while neglecting the others, testified former Haverford State Hospital Superintendent Dr. John Fong at his trial in 1989. The hospital housed a whopping 562 patients in August of 1987. To make matters worse, Fong was arrested shortly after retiring from his position as Superintendent in November of 1988. On Feb. 3, 1989, he was found guilty of tampering with public records in order to falsify an injury report. ""Witnesses at Dr. John Fong's trial presented a picture of deteriorating conditions at Haverford State Hospital, in which employees feared Fong and blindly followed his orders, while coping with patient overcrowding and staff shortages,"" wrote NEWS of Delaware County Staff Writer David Bjorkgren.
Conditions began to improve starting in 1987, and by the early 1990's the hospital had transformed itself and its dubious image, according to Silberner's report. Patients were involved in psycho-educational groups and recreation with a focus on self-help and internalizing personal change. However, the American public's sentiment was slowly turning against the idea of mental institutions as a whole, of which Haverford State Hospital was no exception. In June of 1990, Philadelphia State Hospital closed by court order, making way for a new method of decentralizing mental health services away from state hospitals, and towards community clinics. By 1996, 70,000 patients remained in state and county psychiatric hospitals. Lawyers successfully argued that under the new 'Americans With Disabilities Act', mentally ill people should be kept in the least restricted setting as possible. This decision of the courts put the final nail in Haverford State's coffin, as it deemed inpatient care clinically unnecessary in the context of late 20th century psychiatry. When the closing of the site was announced by the state in 1997, there were 262 patients remaining in residence. By June 3, 1998, 54 of those had been placed in care in the community, and 172 had been transferred to similar accommodations at Norristown State Hospital. The buildings were locked, and the land was sold directly to Haverford Township for future care. The township had struggled to find a proper use for the former hospital property.
Outpatient community clinics were established in Delaware County in response to the absence of the former state hospital. These clinics, which are county funded, are: Northwestern Human Services in Sharon Hill, PA and Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Chester, PA.
On November 14, 2006, the Haverford Township Board of Commissioners approved an agreement for the sale of, and preliminary land development plans for the former hospital. The Haverford Reserve development will include one hundred carriage homes and 198 condominiums, plus the Township of Haverford will ultimately have several athletic fields and over 120 acres for recreation.  On April 5th 2007, the Pennsylvania Attorney General filed an indictment against 5th ward commissioner Fred C. Moran, in conjunction with the sale of the state hospital property. This scandal involved Fred Moran disclosing the bids of other potential developers, that were supposed be confidential, to one contractor in particular. He is currently awaiting trial.
After sitting vacant several years, the buildings of Haverford State Hospital had become dilapidated and damaged beyond repair. The buildings of the complex were reduced to a shell of what they once were. The first buildings to come down were the administration and recreation buildings, followed by the extended treatment and geriatric wards. The final two buildings to be demolished were the boiler plant, and the five story hilltop building, which finally fell on January 17th, 2008.

Pennsylvania,Hollidaysburg State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hollidaysburg_State_Hospital,"Sept 29, 1938 (As a PA State Hospital)",1904,1904,Closed (as a mental health facility),Cottage Plan,,Blair County Hospital for Mental Diseases | Hollidaysburg Veterans Home (Current),"Hollidaysburg State Hospital opened in 1904, as the Blair County Hospital for Mental Diseases. Built on what had been 150 acres of farmland. The original red brick building survives as the Old Administration Building, now home for the Pennsylvania National Guard's 28th Infantry Division Band.
On September 29, 1938 the state took control of the hospital as part of the ""Full State Care Act"". The legislature (Act #53) assumed responsibility for eight of the thirteen existing county public mental hospitals, the other five hospitals were closed. The facility was renamed to Hollidaysburg State Hospital in 1941. But it was not until after World War II that it began the expansion that resulted in the building of Rush Hall, Neil Hall, and Sommer Hall as the main housing and administration units of the complex. The grounds doubled in size, to 326 acres.
As the care of the mentally ill changed from custodial care to outpatient care, the patient population dwindled until a decision was made in the 1970s to shut it down.
The Department of Military Affairs was looking to expand its veterans homes system. At the time, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Erie, opened in 1886, was the only facility available. The decision to shut down Hollidaysburg was reversed and it was transferred to Military Affairs in September 1977. Five residents were admitted to the facility in June of that year on a pilot program.
Renovations to Neil Hall and Rush Hall were completed in 1982 at a cost of $2.8 million for Rush Hall and $3.9 million for Neil Hall. Rush Hall, built in 1953, is now the administration building and nursing care facility. It was renamed Eisenhower Hall after the five-star general and president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Neil Hall, built in 1949, was renamed MacArthur Hall after the former five-star general, Douglas MacArthur. It is now the domiciliary care building. On April 10, 1992, the old Sommer Hall, built in 1954, officially became Arnold Hall, named after the five-star general and native Pennsylvanian, Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, who is considered the father of the Air Force. That $10.2 million project completed the conversion of the former state hospital to a veterans home.

Beginning with the donation of the land by steel tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and prescribed by the Act of Assembly in June 1910, the Cresson Tuberculosis Sanatorium was opened in 1916. The location was considered as ideal due to the abundance of fresh air and the treatments used to combat the disease. The present administration building was built in the European style with gargoyles on the tower and the crests of Scottish clans cut into the sandstone as a reminder of Mr. Carnegie’s heritage.
With the introduction of new drugs and treatments for tuberculosis, the need for sanatoriums declined. In December of 1956 the facility was incorporated into the Lawrence F. Flick State Hospital being run by the Department of Public Welfare to treat the mentally retarded. The facility remained in operation until December 1982.
In 1983 the facility was converted into a state correctional institution under the Bureau of Corrections. Under Executive Order 1983-1, Governor Dick Thornburgh directed that the Bureau of Correction convert the facility to a state correctional institution. Total allocation for design and renovation was $20.6 million. First Lady Ginny Thornburgh, as an advocate of the mentally retarded, requested that the cemetery used by the facility since its inception be maintained as a memorial by the institution. Today the maintenance department and the inmates of SCI Cresson carry on this work.
Construction and renovation began in 1984. Many buildings were renovated with the addition of fire safety, environmental and security equipment. The design for the new housing units for inmates became the prototype for institutions being built across the state. The director’s home was moved from inside the future compound to a site on the road leading to the institution and became the superintendent’s residence.
In the fall of 1986, the SCI Cresson Staff Activation Team was assembled with Jeffrey A. Beard, Ph.D., as superintendent; Martin Dragovich, deputy superintendent for centralized services; Donald Morder, deputy superintendent for operations; David Lewis, business manager; Elizabeth Eckenrode, personnel director; Robert Whitsel, facility maintenance manager; and Lisa (Godish) Beiswenger, superintendent’s secretary. In August, the first inmate work cadre of 10 inmates arrived from SCI Huntingdon. Later, all of these inmates were assigned to SCI Cresson.
The prison closed June 30, 2013 and the land was put up for sale by the state. Big House Produce bought the property in late 2019. They are an indoor hydroponic agricultural farm that also provides tours and photography trips scheduled for the general public.

The new building was the city's first ""poor house"", it held a population of 30. In 1818, an increase in the size of the indigent population resulted in the construction of the Allegheny City Almshouse. By 1846, with the continued increase in patients, the city was scouting sites for yet another new almshouse. Roughly 150 acres were acquired along the banks of the Monongahela River at Homestead, in Mifflin township and a three-story brick building was built to hold 300 patients. The City Poor Farm at Homestead opened in 1852 and by 1879 a separate building was erected for treatment of the insane. With a burgeoning population and a conviction that rural settings were healthier, especially for tuberculosis patients, the city made plans to move the hospital again, this time it would be located well outside the city boundaries. Land along the Monongahela was valuable and the city sold its almshouse acreage to the Carnegie Steel Company for $450,000.
The city bought the George Neal Farm in what is now South Fayette Township at Upper St. Clair., and set up a rail station. In 1892 construction on a new hospital named Marshalsea began. A separate building for the insane was erected, and in 1899, and a physician was assigned to the insane department. In response to the need for adequate medical care for inmates, a general hospital was also erected at this site in 1909. Allegheny City, located on Pittsburgh's North Side, also maintained an institution for the poor and insane at Claremont that later became known as Blawnox. When Allegheny City became part of the city of Pittsburgh on December 6, 1907 the patients of Claremont were transferred to Marshalsea.
By 1900, the hospital's reputation as a place of sorrow was firmly established. The Home Monthly, a publication of the time, described the inmates at Marshalsea as ""Poor wrecks of humanity they are -- some mental, some physical, some moral wrecks -- stranded, at last dependent upon the city for enough to keep a miserable broken body and a poor shrunken soul together. ... If there is to-day a discontented man or woman in this city I prescribe a trip to Marshalsea. The blood may flee from the face at times and pity clutch at the heart strings."" Years later, a contest was held to find a more suitable name for the hospital. There were four finalists, the winner was Mayview. By 1916, the State Legislature gave its consent to change the name of the hospital from Marshalsea to the Pittsburgh City Home and Hospital at Mayview.
In accordance with an act of 1938 that required the state to take over all institutions for the care of the mentally ill, the State of Pennsylvania took control of the mental section of the hospital in 1941. The patient population reached a high point of 3,785 in June of 1967, with 1,200 staff and employees. In March 1973, the Department of Public Welfare made plans to move patients judged to be criminally insane from Farview State Hospital to Mayview. In 1982, an adolescent center was transferred from Woodville State Hospital to Mayview. During the closing of Dixmont State Hospital in 1984, the deaf unit was transferred to Mayview.
The patient population gradually reduced starting in the 1970s, by 2008 the hospital only had 354 patients with 800 staff and employees. The hospital provided services to Allegheny, Beaver, Greene, Lawrence and Washington Counties. In addition, a forensic division of the hospital provides services to clients from the entire region west of Harrisburg. Mayview State Hospital was closed by the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare in December of 2008. The remaining patients were individually assessed and were either transferred to another state hospital or to community care facilities.
A series of deaths and other serious incidents (known by the state as ""sentinel events"") started to occur after the closure of the hospital was announced in 2007. In the space of 24 hours in October 2007, two former Mayview patients died violently. Anthony Fallert, who had been released from the hospital in Spring of 2006, wandered from a South Side residence operated by Mercy Behavioral Mental Health. His body was found a day later in the Monongahela River. Authorities believe he had leapt or fallen from the Birmingham Bridge after leaving the facility. In the year after his release from Mayview, Mr. Fallert had lived at facilities in Clarion County and New Kensington and with his mother in Allentown. The day Mr. Fallert's body was being pulled from the river, another former Mayview patient, Ahson J. Abdullah, was struck by a train as he walked on the tracks near his home in Braddock. Mr. Abdullah, who had been in and out of jail over the course of his life, had been a patient at Mayview's forensic unit, which handles mental health cases referred by the courts. In all, state officials say 44 sentinel events have taken place among the region's mentally ill and critics suggest it could run higher. At the same time, the Department of Public Welfare says that of the 44 events cited, only three involved patients released from Mayview since the closure was announced Aug. 15 of 2007 and only 10 of the 44 cases had any prior history with Mayview.
In 2010, the campus was purchased by Aloe Brothers LLC and by early 2013, nearly all the buildings had been demolished. A new residential development now sits on the former site of the hospital as of August 2018.

Pennsylvania,Norristown State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norristown_State_Hospital,"May 5, 1876","March 21, 1878",1880,Active,Transitional,Wilson Brothers & Company,Norristown Asylum for the Insane | State Lunatic Hospital at Norristown,"Norristown State Hospital, formally the 'State Lunatic Hospital at Norristown', is an active psychiatric hospital run by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and has been operational since it's opening in the spring of 1880. At it's height in the 1940's it maintained a clinical population of about five thousand patients, and held national renown for its modern psychiatric practices. In more recent years, Norristown State's population has declined significantly to that of about 150 civilian beds. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania continues to maintain the site, but at a greatly reduced size and clinical capacity. It is currently the only remaining state psychiatric facility active in south-eastern Pennsylvania with the closure of Philadelphia State Hospital in 1990, Haverford State Hospital in 1998, and Allentown State Hospital in 2010. It continues to serve the five surrounding Pennsylvania counties- Philadelphia, Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware and Chester.
Since much of the original grounds belonging to the 1880 asylum are no longer used by the modern hospital, it has since been sub-divided to the care of local agencies, such as: Norristown Farm Park, Norris City Cemetery, Elmwood Park Zoo and West Norriton Fire Department. The buildings that remain active with Norristown State Hospital tend to be more modern structure capable of catering to modern psychiatric practices. There are, however, a large number of building on site that are inactive, or completely abandoned and waiting for demolition. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has not made any formal statement about what they intend to do with the site in the long term, or if they intend to completely close the state hospital in the immediate future.
In May 1876, Governor John Hartranft formed a blue-ribbon commission to study the civic need for additional state asylums to tend to the overcrowded county almshouses in the region. They examined the possibility of opening this facility outside of Philadelphia, but without a specific location indicated. They found that Norristown would prove an appropriate location for this project. In that same year, under Public Law 121, the Pennsylvania Legislature called for the establishment of a state mental hospital to serve the Southeastern District of Pennsylvania for the benefit of the poor and those individuals deprived of their reason. A two hundred and sixty five acre tract in the northern part of Norristown borough (which now split between the city of Norristown and East Norriton Township) was chosen for the asylum grounds, at the crossing of Stanbridge and Sterigere Streets. At the time of its construction many of the local residents were farmers, or in the business of agricultural supplies. The properties of Norristown State Hospital were obtained from eight individual properties of local landowners, obtained between the hospital's construction in 1878 and 1918. They were:
Work began on the administration building on March, 21, 1878. $600,000 was secured by the legislature of the commonwealth for this project and the construction of the seven original wards. This year can be found engraved at the top of the tower on the Administration Building at Norristown (Building #19), at the front of the hospital complex. The design for the original 1880 complex came from Philadelphia based Wilson Brothers & Company, also known for their design of Drexel University and Reading Terminal. Upon the primary structure's completion on February 17, 1879 there were only two other state-owned hospitals operating, one in Danville, which opened in 1872, and one in Harrisburg, that opened in 1851. At the time, other plans were underway to construct another at Warren. Norristown was built to alleviate the overcrowding in the psychiatric wards of the Philadelphia Almshouse, as well as private hospitals, such as Friends Hospital and the Pennsylvania Hospital. At its opening, the hospital was turned over to the Board of Trustees  with its thirteen members for operation, which still controls and oversees the welfare of the physical hospital and it's operation. From its opening, the hospital was opened to both sexes, albeit segregated, and continued to be divided into independent male and female departments until 1923. In 1924, when the asylum was serving nearly three thousand patients, the hospital was reorganized under a single superintendent.
As with most state hospitals at the time, there was a farm with livestock and crops on the grounds and the patients helped to operate the facility well into the 1970's. A number of barns and cottage homes were also built across the property, sometimes permitting semi-autonomous patients to live together. Norristown State Hospital continues to operate a farmer's market on the grounds currently at its greenhouses, which are open to the public. However, nothing is grown on site, and most of the former farmland are currently under the jurisdiction of Norristown Farm Park. Roads and sewers were built on the property, most of which remain active, and a large portion of the grounds were enclosed by an cast-iron fence, eight feet high. This cast-iron fence is still operational and can be seen from Sterigere and Stanbridge street. Barns and a root-house were also constructed at the hospitals opening, many of which also still survive on the grounds. The sewage was emptied into Stony Creek until 1900, or so, when it was found to be injurious to the local wildlife.
The general dimensions of the separate ward buildings were originally 277 feet in length by 90 feet in depth. Each ward building consisted of a basement, used for steam-heating ducts and workshops, and two main stories, each containing two wards and giving four wards to each ward building. Each ward was originally complete in itself, with separate patient rooms, dormitories, dining-rooms, and bath-rooms. The wards are ventilated by stacks with steam coiled at the base for creating the drought that draws the air from the wards.
Norristown State Hospital received its first patient, a woman, on July 12, 1880 under the supervision of Dr. Robert H. Chase and Dr. Alice Bennett. Two more women arrived on July 13th followed by the first two men on July 17th. Very soon thereafter groups of individuals were admitted from other state hospitals and county almshouses. By September 30, 1880, there were 295 men and 251 women receiving inpatient care and treatment.
Norristown State Hospital was the first of the Pennsylvania state hospitals to construct its buildings deviating slightly from the ""Kirkbride Plan"", best known as ""Transitional Plan"". Instead of constructing a single monolithic building, the individual patient wards were separated and free-standing. These building were connected with a series of underground tunnels, including a central tunnel which stretches across the property. Norristown still maintains the schematics of Kirkbride's original plan, with it separation of male and female departments, as well as leveling the acuity of patients by ward.
There was a tremendous emphasis during the early period on a 'humane' approach to psychiatric treatment (""moral therapy"") allowing the individual as much liberality as his/her condition would permit, which was common of the period. Several low-acuity wards were unlocked for periods of time, and grounds privileges was a common feature of daily life. Work assignments became a significant feature of a patient's daily routine, many focusing on the workings of the state farm. They were not limited to farm work, other occupational departments include: Administration, Bakery, Billiard room, Boiler room, Bric-a-brac shop, Brush shop, Butcher, Carpenter shop, Dispensary, Garden, Kitchen, Laundry, Machinists, Mattress shop, News-room, Out-door improvement, Painters, Plasterers, Plumbers, Printing office, Scroll saw shop, Shoemakers, Stables, Store-rooms, Tailors, Wards and dining rooms and Weavers. However, with the change in Pennsylvania State Law in the 1970's, hospital patients were no longer permitted to be involved in farm labor. Thereafter, the farmlands were employed by separates agencies of the city of Norristown, namely Norris-City and Norristown Farm Park.
The hospital was organized into three sections - men, women, and a business section headed by a steward. Each section was completely independent of the other, with almost completely separate services. The staff of the men's unit was for sometime all men, and the staff of the women's unit all women. A Nursing School was established in 1897, at this time the hospital census had passed two-thousand patients. Accommodation was also made for nurses on the grounds with the construction of a 'Nurses Home', which is still standing, but not operating under the direct jurisdiction of the state hospital.
During the year 1901, 213 employees were listed on the books, most of whom either resided on the grounds or in the neighboring residences. Proportion of attendants to average number of patients was 1 to 9.5. The wages that were paid to attendants totaled some $59,903.00. Weekly per capita cost of operations was $3.29.
An expansion of the asylum's campus was completed between 1907 and 1909, with the construction of several new buildings funding by a state grant. This period saw the construction of: the Acute Admissions Building (Building #17), the Superintendent's House (Building #18), the Nurses' Home (Building #15), the Assembly Hall (Building #33) and the Female Convalescent Building (Building #16).
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania eventually responded to the pleas of overcrowding made by patients and physicians alike, and opened up Allentown State Hospital in the fall of 1910; and thus removing Lehigh and Northampton county from the jurisdiction of Norristown State. In 1937, they also purchased Byberry City Farms in Northeast Philadelphia and had it officially converted, or at least nominally converted, into Philadelphia State Hospital, which then removed Philadelphia county from Norristown's catchment area. For the most part, these changes alleviated the burden of overcrowding in state hospitals temporarily. However, within a few short decades Norristown State Hospital was again exceeding its capacity.
In 1923 the hospital's Board of Trustees voted to combine under one management with a single medical superintendent. Dr. Frederick C. Robbins was selected as the first superintendent under this combined system. For clinical psychiatry, the 1920's and 1930's saw the development of specialized departments in state hospitals, such as Social Work, Occupational Therapy, and Psychology. Additionally, Volunteer Resources, Patient Recreation, and Vocational Services were formally established as independent departments as well, with the intention of developing more specialized treatment for treating a larger diagnostic spectrum. Specialized treatment units for substance abuse, social rehabilitation, psycho-geriatrics, adolescents, and forensics, among others, were developed at Norristown during the latter 1940's and into the 1960's.
The renowned Dr. Arthur P. Noyes (1881-1963) became superintendent in 1936 and remained in that position until his retirement in 1959. Dr. Noyes started the Psychiatric Residency Program which was to be in operation for almost fifty years, operating well into the 1990's, and which gained national clinical prestige. He also opened new hospital gates (Gates #2, #3, #4 and #5) and introduced many innovations in therapeutic treatment of state hospital patients. His magnum opus, 'Modern Clinical Psychiatry', is considered a classic in the field of Psychiatry. In 1959, he was honored by being appointed as Director of Psychiatric Education for the Department of Public Welfare for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A non-profit research foundation bearing his name is still active to this day. However, as the superintendent of Norristown State, Dr. Noyes oversaw one of the largest expansions of the state hospital with a large grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Structures constructed at this time include: Female Ward for Untidy Patients (Building #8), Male Ward for Untidy Patients (Building #13), Male Disturbed Building (Building #51), Female Disturbed Building (Building #50), the Senile Building (Building #53) and the Medical Surgical Building (Building #52).
In 1949, Dr. Noyes also developed several satellite aftercare clinics in Montgomery and Bucks County for the care of state hospital patients following their treatment. This facilities eventually became independent of Norristown State Hospital, and are still in use today as community mental health clinics. All of these clinics were in association with a local general hospital, 'Central Montgomery Mental Health Clinic' was associated with Montgomery Hospital, 'Eastern Montgomery Mental Health Clinic' was associated with Abington Memorial Hospital, 'Western Montgomery Mental Health Clinic' was associated with Pottstown Memorial Hospital and 'Mental Health Guidance Clinic of Bucks County' was associated with Doylestown Hospital. All of these clinics remain active, albeit under different names, and without their former association to Norristown or their original general hospital. These became the base service units (BSU) employed by those counties for the outpatient treatment of the mentally ill. In time Bucks County's clinic split in two and became: Lenape Valley Foundation in Doylestown and Penndel Mental Health in Levittown, both of which remain active. Montgomery County's clinics became more numerous, particularly with the closure of state hospital beds. The 'Eastern' clinic was remained the Creekwood Center, which remains active, along with the 'Western' clinic, now known as Creative Health Services. Montgomery County has since contracted: Lower Merion Counseling, Penn Foundation and Northwestern Human Services to address their large mentally ill population.
During the 1930's and 1940's electro-shock therapy (ECT), insulin coma therapy, and lobotomies became increasingly common methods of inpatient treatment. ECT was frequently employed on the grounds on Norristown until the late 1980's.  Also changing the atmosphere of clinical psychiatry was the usage of psychotropic (anti-psychotic) medications beginning with the advent of Thorazine. Medications were perceived as being able to help control and lessen the severity of many of the symptoms and behaviors associated with psychotic disorders and mood lability.
During World War II staffing became a critical issue with Norristown State Hospital, as much of the nation's manpower was being diverted into the war effort. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania deployed Civilian Public Service Unit No. 66 to the grounds to account for the absence of clinical staffing during the conflict. These mainly consisted of German Mennonites, who were conscientious objector to the war because of their faith, and were unable to participate through military service in the defeat of Germany and Japan. However, in lieu of military service, they were employed by the state on the grounds of the Norristown to work with the poor and mentally ill. They were active on the grounds from December of 1942 until October of 1946 to fill in for the shortage of available manpower that the war had created.
Two large ""Consumptive Sanitoriums"" were also built on the grounds at this time, Hacket Cottage (Building #40) and Johnson Cottage (Building #39), for the treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis. These two buildings replaced the Lower Farm House as the residence for the treatment of Tuberculosis. They were employed and active for public use until 1969, when they were closed by the state and demolished shortly thereafter. However, the circular concrete driveway for their front entrance can still be seen near Gate #4, and near Building #50.
The late 1960's and early 1970's popular psychiatry stressed an emphasis on placement of many patients into the community and county-funded outpatient clinics, known as BSU's (Base Service Unit), which remain the preferred treatment for the mentally ill. As a result, the census of Norristown State began to drop significantly, as well as at all the other state hospitals nationally. The census of the inpatient population dropped from about 3,200 in February 1968 to slightly over 1,700 in May 1973. This decline continued into the 1980's and 90's with wards being regularly shutdown by the state as a cost-cutting measure. The passing decades also brought a change in the day-to-day therapeutic process the hospital would employ. By the early 1970's, each patient had an individualized personal treatment plan and met regularly with a multidisciplinary treatment team, per the regulations implemented by the state and insurance carriers. This regulations continues to the present with each patient having a period of therapeutic treatment and psycho-educational participation each day verbalized in an individual treatment plan.
With the closure of other state psychiatric facility Norristown State appropriated a larger geographical jurisdiction. When Philadelphia State Hospital closed in 1990 a large number of their acute patients were transferred to units in Norristown for continuity of care purposes. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was able to allocate five million dollars in funds for this transfer. Just the same, when Haverford State Hospital was shutdown in 1998, the greater part of their inpatient population was also transferred to various buildings at Norristown. Per the work of many civil employees, Norristown also became the site of a repository of state medical records, particularly of sites that have already been shut down.
A number of the original 1880 complex have been destroyed or replaced over the years. Of the original seven building complex, only two are still standing and active. The last bit of construction to take place on the site was Building #48, which houses the Psychology Department and Building #1, 'Lenape Hall', which is an active inpatient unit for the state hospital. A number of the older residential buildings have been set to adaptive re-use, such as the original superintendent's house, which is now a Crisis Residential Program. The acute admissions building, which is damaged beyond restoration, is also used at times by local fire academies for common drills.
In more recent years, Norristown State Hospital has assimilated multiple patients and staff from the closures of other state hospitals so now it is the only remaining state hospital in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Its current catchment area is identical to the catchment area it maintainted at its opening in 1880. Many patient buildings on the grounds are no longer operational, or are uninhabitable and are awaiting demolition. Others still are leased to other mental health agencies, namely: Circle Lodge CRR, Horizon House-ACT, ShopMates, Community Homeless Outreach Center (CHOC), HopeWorx, STAR-Carelink and Montgomery County Emergency Services (MCES). The grounds are also open to the public, and frequently have pedestrians walking the grounds.
A number of the buildings on site have become considerable fire hazards because of their decay and poor condition. Collapsing roofs and small fires are not uncommon to these buildings, and the Norristown Fire Department has been called a number of times to address these re-occurring issues.

The future of Norristown State Hospital is up for some considerable debate. The site itself is overseen by two state agencies, the Department of General Services and the Department of Public Welfare, but neither has a concrete plan for its future. Total closure seems unlikely, particularly the one hundred and thirty-six patient forensic unit (Building #51) for criminally insane, which is always near its capacity. However, the infrastructure of the site is dubious at best, as the buildings range from fifty to over a hundred years old.
Since 1989, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has Closed approximately 1300 state hospital beds, as part of their 'Community Hospital Integration Project Plans' (CHIPPs). The intention has long been the total closure of the state hospital system, which had been moving forward with haste in the past twenty years. Locally, Philadelphia State Hospital was closed in 1989 after several lawsuits. Haverford State Hospital was closed in 1998 under similar terms. The commonwealth also closed the doors on Allentown State Hospital in 2010 and Harrisburg State Hospital in 2006, leaving a remaining handful of sites active. The civilian population at Norristown has been on a strategic decline; 410 beds in 2001, 366 beds in 2002, 306 beds in 2003, 304 beds in 2004, 304 in 2005, 304 in 2006, 294 in 2007, 264 beds in 2008, 234 beds in 2009 and 204 beds in 2010. There have been serious talks about a closure of the civilian division of the state hospital, with the intent to divert their acute population into local long-term structured residences (LTSR), but that has yet to materialize.
In 1880, Dr. (Mary) Alice Bennett, was appointed superintendent of the Women’s Department at Norristown State Asylum, the first woman in the nation to direct a female division in a psychiatric institution. She graduated with an MD from the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania (Now part of Drexel University School of Medicine) in 1876 and a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1880, where she was also a graduate lecturer. She was aided in this appointment by fellow classmate, Dr. Anna Kugler, who acted as her assistant physician. During her tenure, Dr. Bennett profited from the Victorian notion that as a woman physician, she could best treat patients of her own sex and in turn, introduced her own ideas of patient management. The asylum superintendents had a variety of opinions regarding the subjects of a female physician. Dr. Gray out of of Utica, NY, Dr. Kirkbride in Philadelphia, PA and Dr. Chapin of Willard, NY all wrote letters to their governors opposing the employment of these women-physicians. However, they largely fell on deaf ears.
Dr. Bennett abolished the practice of straitjackets and chains on patients at Norristown during her tenure, which previously had been commonplace through many western asylums. Instead, she contended that such restraints were ineffective and would only result in a patient's anger and a growing resentment towards their caregiver. She therefore theorized that checking the patients' energy into a single direction by physically constraining them would sublimate that energy to another potential outlet. She believed that restraints contradicted the ethical treatment of patients, as proposed by Quaker York retreat decades earlier, one based on mutual respect between patient and caregiver. Dr. Bennett also introduced occupational therapy to Norristown, such as music, painting, and handicrafts. Other asylums for the mentally ill adopted this practice and her policy of non-restraint, winning her widespread professional recognition in the young field of clinical psychiatry.
In 1890, the Montgomery County Medical Society in Pennsylvania elected her to be their first woman president. She was also a member of the American Medical Association, the Philadelphia Neurological Society, and the Philadelphia Medical Jurisprudence Society, and was one of the original incorporators of the Spring Garden Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. Dr. Bennett also was on the board of trustees, as the commissioner, and assisted in the design of Wernersville State Hospital in 1892. After sixteen years as superintendent at Norristown, Bennett returned to private practice in her hometown of Wrentham, NY in 1896.
In 1892, the Board of Public Charities accused the medical staff of Norristown State Hospital, under the orders of Dr. Alice Bennett of surgical experimentation on human subjects, after the removal of the ovaries of six women were reported as a cure for Insanity. Under the alluring title, ""An Experimentation in Castration"" the New York Medical Record editorially gives the following unique item of news:
""An interesting experiment has suddenly come to grief at the Norristown Insane Asylum, Pa. Some of the medical staff became much impressed with the value of castrating women as a therapeutic measure in insanity.""
This was initially met with some approval from the scientific community, and was also seen with great interest by Dr. Thomas Morton, then head of the male department in Norristown. Each subjects was specified in anonymity, with full results published by the medical staff. In Dr. Bennett's own words, ""to summarize: of the six cases operates upon, three, or half the number, have perfectly recovered in body and mind. One is much improved. One is improved in some respect and not others. One died. It is of interest to note that five of the six, were of puerperal origin."" Two of the six result records are as follows:
Late backlash would shed these experiments in a different light. James J. Levick stated, “Insanity is a disease of the brain, not of some organ remote from it; and when manifestation of insanity seem to be especially associated with functional disturbances of some one organ, this disturbance is secondary to the brain disorder, not the cause of it.” Those who opposed this procedure greatly rejoiced that, “the hospitals and the profession are saved from a scandalous proceeding.” However, practices such as these were also common place in neighboring Trenton State Hospital under the infamous Dr. Cotton, where teeth were removed to cure the psychotic features of a patient. It was further questioned whether Gynecology should be practiced in Asylums at all, and if an insane person should be treated gynecologically just as any other person would be treated, and that an examination, diagnosis and treatment ought to be instituted independent of her mental condition.
There is no note what followed these experiments in any journal, as they are only practiced for a few months in 1892. There appears to be no documentation of any backlash directed towards Dr. Bennett, or her staff physicians, for the unethical nature of these experiments; or for that matter, the resulting death that took place because of her work.
Like many state hospitals, Norristown has had alleged cases of patient abuse since it's opening. IN 1882, Mary Ritchie, an eighty years old resident of the hospital, had her arm fractured because she refused to take a bath. She was seized by two of the attendants, and in the struggle her arm was broken. Mary Green, one of the attendants, was then discharged by the asylum committee. Just the same, another patient, Jacob Miller, also had an arm broken by the attendants, and three of the men employed in the male department were discharged. These unfortunates had suffered most at the hands of the attendants.[1]
On August 4, 1883, William A. J. Fiss died in the hands of James Gaffey, an asylum attendant, after he struck Fiss in the head. Fiss became incoherent and died from blood poisoning at 12:45 am. that morning. [2]
With the introduction of Electroshock therapy (ECT) in the 1940's there was significant talk of its clinical overuse. The superintendent of the time, Dr. Nolan D. Lewis, discounted these criticisms and maintained that ECT was being employed regularly, but with 'Conservative discretion'. He made the argument that its use was limited to patients who were unresponsive to continuous baths, and that other methods of sedation were preferable, and employed before ECT could be suggested.
Hospital staff were themselves not safe from abuse at the hands of hospital administrators of the mid-20th century. It is noted that during the 1948 fiscal year, six hundred staff members were hired for direct care of patients on various units. However, within the year three hundred and fifty resigned their posts, and nearly two hundred were fired. By many superintendent's admission, the task of working with the mentally ill was taxing, and presented: low pay, extended hours of the work week, little recreation and substandard housing for employees. However, often times the welfare of the attendants was also dubious, as the commonwealth placed a number of their employees in hazardous situations due to financial constraints.[3]
[4][5]
Norristown State Hospital was built in three separate stages, all of which represent different stylistic approaches to architecture and psychiatric therapies. The first phase of construction lasted from: 1878 until 1910, which encompassed most of the Transitional-Kirkbride complex, and is in the Victorian High Gothic Style, or the slightly toned-down Edwardian. The next phase, which was the largest of the campus, came between 1937 and 1940, and was noted for its larger and more utilitarian buildings. This period of state hospital construction was particularly noted for its banality, and has been criticized as ""warehousing"" patients. The final stage of growth was in the mid-1960's, which saw the demolition of a number of older structures, and their replacement with their sterile 'art deco' equivalents. The names of buildings that follow are how they would be known, circa 1940:
Building #1 Female Acute Ward Building- Active; the original was demolished in the 1960's and rebuilt across the street as an active inpatient unit for the state hospital. The original building #1 was a red brick structure with an interior courtyard built in 1883. It was the only building from the original complex not to be finished on schedule because of a lack of funds. The current structure of Building #1 is made from white bricks and a limestone facade, with a more contemporary design. It is sometimes referred to as 'Lenape Hall'. The Toggery shop is still active and open to the public. This building houses a theater and an indoor pool.
Building #2 Female Ward Building- Abandoned; was used to house the Regional Mental Health Resource Coordination Office of Southeast Pennsylvania. It was built in 1880 and was originally designed to accommodate mid-acuity patients for the Female Department.
Building #3 Female Ward Building- Demolished; It was built in 1880 and was originally used for mid-acuity patients for the Female Department.
Building #4 Female Ward Building- Demolished; It was built in 1880 and was originally used for low-acuity patients for the Female Department.
Building #5 Male Ward Building- Abandoned; It was built in 1880 and was originally used for low-acuity patients for the Male Department. In more recent years it was leased for offices by the Philadelphia Mental Health Care Corporation (PHMCC). Demolished in 2022
Building #6 Male Ward Building- Partially Abandoned; It was built in 1880 and was originally used for mid-acuity patients for the Male Department. The back of the building is still active and is leased by HopeWorx for the Consumer Satisfaction Team. Demolished in 2022
Building #7 Male Ward Building- Demolished; It was built in 1880 and was originally used for mid-acuity patients for the Male Department. It is now a community garden.
Building #8 Male Acute Ward Building- Abandoned; It was built in 1880 and demolished in 1937, rebuilt that same year as a new ward for high acuity patients. Demolished in 2022
Building #9 Male Hydro-therapy Building- Active; The original was built in 1887 and originally it was designated as the male infirmary ward until 1937 when medical procedures were conducted in the medical-surgical building. It replaced the prior one story co-ed infirmary on the grounds. The original was demolished and replaced with the new Building #9, also known as 'Harriet Tubman House', which held the hospital's neurology ward and long-term care ward well into the 1990's. It currently houses the hospital's geropsychiatric population.
Building #10 Female Hydro-therapy Building- Active; The original was built in 1887 and originally it was designated as the male infirmary ward until 1937 when medical procedures were conducted in the medical-surgical building.

It was demolished in the late 1950's and replaced with the new Building #10, also known as Pennsylvania House', and acts as an inpatient unit for the current state hospital.
Building #11 Unknown- A brief report from 1907 stated that Ward #11 had ""a destructive fire [that] almost destroyed ward building No. 11. Fortunately, the fire occurred early in the evening and by prompt action all the inmates were saved and no one was injured."" However, its fate was never specified. There is a current Building #11, known as 'York House'; however, it too appears to be abandoned. Demolished in 2022

A pipe organ was also installed through the generosity of the Commonwealth's Legislature. The current Building #33 is from the late 1960's, and was intended to replace that structure, which was believed to be in disrepair. It is sometimes used for arts festivals; however, that is rare anymore. There is still a chapel in it's basement with a chaplain present at times in the early morning.
Building #34 Pathological Lab and Morgue- Demolished; The original structure was built in 1906, but was demolished and rebuilt as Building #54.
Building #35 Hartranft Cottage- Demolished/Active; formally a staff dormitory, similar to Building #32. Now it is the site of a police barracks.

In January of 2018, following the announcement of the closure of the civil section of Norristown State Hospital, a collection of locals have attempted to compile a folk history of the hospital and its legacy. They are currently collecting photos, documents, memoirs, and other assorted artifacts regarding the impact of the hospital on the region.

 Nolen & Swinburne (Furey Ellis Hall/Auditorium)",Byberry State Hospital | Byberry City Farms | Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Diseases,"Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry (PSH) was a psychiatric hospital in northeast Philadelphia, first city and later state-operated. During its tenure as a psychiatric hospital it was known by several names- Philadelphia State Hospital, Byberry State Hospital, Byberry City Farms, and the Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Diseases. However, most of the local population referred to it simply as ""Byberry"". Like many state facilities of the period, it was designated to care for individuals with various cognitive and psychiatric conditions, ranging from intellectual disabilities to forensic pathologies. When operational, it was located on a large sprawling campus within the Somerton neighborhood of northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Byberry stood in operation from 1903 until 1990, when it became nationally infamous for patient abuse, warehousing of human beings, and extreme neglect exhibited towards its many residents. At its zenith in the late 1960's, it was the largest state hospital in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and held a clinical population of over seven thousand psychiatric patients. Today, much of the physical site of the former state hospital has been demolished, and the land has been sold off to local redevelopers, who have transformed much of the campus into a residential community for seniors. Many of the former patients were discharged to: local boarding homes, community rehabilitative residences (CRR), long-term structure residences (LTSR), community living arrangements (CLA) and outpatient community clinics (BSU's). Acute patients from Byberry were transferred to other state psychiatric facilities, such as those at Norristown State Hospital and Haverford State Hospital. However, a large portion of those patients discharged had no disposition at release.
In 1903, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted the ""Bullitt Bill"", which required each county to build an maintain a facility exclusively for the care of the insane of the area. Private facilities, such as those at Friends Hospital and the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital had existed for some time. Regional state facilities, like Norristown State Hospital, were active and standing, but were found to be overcrowded and unable to accommodate the growing need. In response to this, the City of Philadelphia purchased farmland in the northeast section of the county, in a rural district then known as Byberry. There, as a measure of expanding the public welfare, they established a city-funded, inmate run farm, known simply as ""Byberry Farms"". This facility was intended to supply food for other public institutions in the city, such as Eastern State Penitentiary and the Philadelphia Almshouse (then known as Old Blockley Almshouse). Shortly after the purchase of the land, six inmates from the overcrowded Blockley Almshouse in the city were chosen to work at the agricultural facility. This program was done in cooperation with the physicians at Blockley Almshouse, then headed by Dr. Jeffrey A. Jackson MD, and would thereafter become known as the ""colony plan"". The site of Byberry was originally intended for patients suffering from Consumption (Pulmonary Tuberculosis), who would be sent from Old Blockley, and thus free additional space for patients suffering from chronic and undifferentiated insanity. As it happens, this medical dogma coincides with the early 20th century perception that Consumption could be treated with ""fresh air"" and exercise.
By 1906, Byberry Farms had expanded through $261,000 in city grants, allocated by Philadelphia Mayor John Weaver and the administration of Philadelphia Almshouse. The site itself sat on 874-acres, and consisted of fifteen small wooden farmhouses serving as temporary dormitories, or ""colony houses"", for the growing patient population. The city was successful in purchasing a number of local farms, one by one, and incorporating them into the new civic facility. The Keigler, Mulligan, Kessler, Jenks (a relative of Thomas Story Kirkbride), Grub, Tomlinson, Osmund, Carver, Alburger, Updyke, Comly, and Carter families all had no qualms about the sale of their property to the city. Many of whom sought financial refuge from the increasing tax hikes of the consolidated county of Philadelphia. Additionally properties were obtained by the same means in 1911 and 1913. At this time, the site of the city farm housed approximately thirty patients, all of whom had been moved from the heavily overcrowded wards of Old Blockley, to the rural atmosphere of Northeast Philadelphia. The city and general public promoted this notion, of sending some of the local ""undesirables"" out of site into an agrarian atmosphere. Particularly, the administration of Philadelphia Mayor Samuel Ashbridge, who politically benefited from hiding the rising social iniquity in the city, by removing the neglected poor and insane out of the public's peripheral vision. After a visitation to the site, Dr. William Coplin, the first Director of the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, said that Byberry:
""...is splendidly located, well suited to farming and possesses a surface contour adapted to the erection of buildings for the reception of the insane at present crowded into the insufficient space afforded by antiquated buildings long out of date and no longer capable of alteration to meet modern requirements.""
After a brief civil inquiry, Byberry City Farms was selected as the new site of the ""Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Diseases"" shortly after its founding. Before the hospital's public opening in 1907, the first officially accepted patient, William McClain, was admitted for alcoholism.
A contract was awarded to architect Philip H. Johnson in 1904, to design the original buildings of the hospital, in a cottage plan layout, in a colonial revival style. Construction became a slow process, as it commenced in 1907, and was not fully complete until the late 1920's. Plans for the east campus (male group) consisted of six dormitory buildings, an infirmary, a laundry building, an administrative building and a combination kitchen/dining hall and power-plant. The utilitarian and banal structure of the power-plant was the centerpiece of the campus and the first officially constructed building. The east campus, which held the ""incurable"" males, was largely completed in 1912. Following the partial completion of the east campus, construction for the west campus began in 1913. Like its parallel on the east campus, the west campus was designated to the ""incurable"" females patients of Philadelphia. These buildings were more architecturally ornate and consisted of ten identical dormitory buildings, a dining hall/refectory building, two buildings for the treatment of tuberculosis, a laundry building, an administrative building, and a medical infirmary. Unlike the east campus, the west campus had above ground patient hallways with large illuminating windows, connecting all of the buildings on campus.
With the start of World War I, construction was halted until the final armistice of the German Empire in 1919. When work resumed on the west campuses power plant, which unlike the east campus, was built at a distance from the campus it served. Construction fully resumed on both east and west campuses in 1922, and was completed by 1928. Heavy criticism of the hospital's condition led to the construction of an additional medical infirmary, exclusively for female patients, as the last of the original buildings on west campus, being completed in 1935.
The hospital was in need of a separate unit to house adolescents, which would in time, became its south campus. Construction began on this additional expansion in 1926, and consisted of six cottages, a patient cafeteria, a small administrative building, and a small playground. The campus itself only took a year to complete, and was in active use by 1927. By the 1930's, Byberry had become severely overcrowded, and the buildings were in almost constant need of repair. Allegedly, the hospital was so substantially insufficiently funded by the city's budget, that during the depression some patients were naked year round because there were simply no clothes or shoes for them to wear. Since the salary for attendants was meager at best, hospital administrators were forced to hire: drunks, ex-felons, former patients, the outright abusive, or pretty much anyone off the street who was willing to accept work. Often after being arrested on a minor charge, petty criminals were offered the choice of jail time or employment at Byberry.
In 1936, a Philadelphia Record photographer Mac Parker, disguising himself as an attendant, snuck in his camera onto the hospital grounds and took some very revealing photos of life inside Byberry. His photos, revealed what it was like inside of the ""snake pit"", and caused a sensation of negative public opinion. In 1938, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania intervened, and absorbed Byberry into the state hospital system. With new state funds, a comprehensive new building plan was instated to alleviate the overcrowding of the site, as well as hire qualified and empathetic staff. In 1938, George Wharton Pepper Jr. was hired as the new primary architect of the campus, as the former, Philip Johnson, had died in 1933.
The ""Workers Building"" also known as S1, opened in 1942, also housed a new recreational section for patients that contained: a gym, bowling alley, a swimming pool, basketball courts, a library and a spa. As S1 was opening, work began on the N6 and N7 buildings which were large dormitories that housed patients who suffered with senility. The commonwealth also renamed the site at this time, from the former ""Byberry Hospital for Mental Diseases"" to the more familiar ""Philadelphia State Hospital"".
Like many state hospitals during World War II, there was crippling manpower shortage. Young men were recruited into the military, and many former commercial and industrial jobs were placed in the hands of women and the elderly. Civilian Public Service Unit, Camp No. 49, was brought to Byberry in August of 1942 to fill in. The unit was operated by the 'American Friends Service Committee', which remained active on site, until it withdrew in April of 1946. These individuals, most of which were men, CPS-49 worked as orderlies and ward attendants for the hospital's many buildings. They came from a background of conscientious objectors, who's religious or personal beliefs made it impossible for them to engage in the war. However, in lieu of military service, they worked civil service jobs for the state to satisfy the need for limited manpower.
At the time the CPS unit was established, Byberry had one hundred ten vacancies in a male attendant staff, of their one hundred seventy-three positions.  According to Charles Zeller, Superintendent of Byberry, the ratio of attendant to patients was one attendant per shift for one hundred forty-four patients.  After the attendants arrived, usually one to four attendants worked with three hundred fifty patients in the “violent” building.  When the unit grew to nearly one hundred thirty-five attendants, usually six to seven attendants worked during the early day shift in that ward, while five attendants staffed the 2 pm to 11 pm shift. The hospital paid attendants room and board, laundry, and a personal maintenance fee, originally $2.50 per month.  That was later increased to $10-15 per month.
For the women’s wards, staff shortages were even more severe. One attendant staffed a two-story building housing two hundred forty-three patients;  two attendants covered the first shift of a semi-violent ward of over two hundred fifty patients, and only one attendant staffed each of the second and third shifts. Women attendants worked for $66.50 per month, plus room and board, including laundry for a fifty-four hour work week.  CPS wives also received that wage as they were not subject to Selective Service regulations.
Post World War II, Philadelphia State Hospital continued to enjoy enormous physical expansion. In 1946, the new kitchen/dietary building, ‘N-5’, was opened for clinical use. The following year ‘S-2’ (twin to the ‘S-1’ building), a building for patients engaged in occupational therapy, was completed. By the 1950’s though, its original purpose was almost forgotten and the building was converted into a regular patient dormitory to keep up with the overcrowding that was common to that period. In 1948, ground was broken for a new building called ‘N-3’, the Active Therapy Building, which was the first steps towards aggressively treating acute patients.
In 1950, ‘The Active Therapy Building’ was completed and opened for clinical use. One half of it consisted of the typical patient dormitories and day rooms, while the other half of the building was filled with lab equipment, a staff library, an auditorium, a large and efficient mortuary, the hospital’s autopsy department, and a training center for staff. The same year ground was broken for the new tuberculosis building N10, but the architect George Pepper died in 1949. Even though Pepper had already completed layout, the state contracted out the remaining buildings to various firms which resulted in subtle differences between buildings N8, N9, and N10. The new tuberculosis building, also known as N10, was opened in 1951. This was the largest building, housing its own full sized cafeterias and kitchens, plus a dental office, x-ray rooms and an ER. Ironically, seven years later, medical science found a cure for TB. N10s original purpose was no longer being needed, it became the medical/surgical building.
A change in the 1950's that occurred due to state control was a re-designation of the building titles. The north campus was split into the north and west groups; N3, N5, N6, and N7 were changed to W3, W5, W6 and W7. The female buildings were now classified as the C buildings or ""Central Group"", as they were located between the south and north groups. The south and east groups were renamed to the first letter of the group, so the east group was now the E buildings and the south group was now called the S buildings.
In 1955, at the time of his death, a new auditorium was constructed in honor of Furey Ellis, who was partially responsible for Byberry's turn around. The Furey Ellis Hall improved public relations, being equipped with modern film projectors and accommodations for up to 400 patients.
The children's unit was demolished and the children were transferred to the C4 and C5 buildings. With the rise of transportation the staff buildings were no longer needed and the south unit buildings were demolished by the 1970s. With a small amount of remaining staff who still chose the option to live on the grounds, W7 was re-designated, bricked off from the connecting tunnels, and turned into staff housing as well as staff offices and make-shift lounges.
With the beginning of deinstitutionalization, Byberry began its downsizing process in 1962, releasing almost 2,000 patients to mental health centers, other hospitals and the streets between 1962 and 1972. The E buildings began transferring their patients to the north and west groups in 1954, and were completely closed off by 1964. Significantly dropping funds forced the hospital to stop accepting admissions and continue transferring patients to other facilities in the mid 1970s. In the early 1980s the C buildings became mostly vacant, and administration was moved to the W3 building. The last remaining forensic patients were housed in ‘N-8’ after it received a thorough interior makeover in 1985.
With the hospital being completely understaffed, many patients were neglected and abused. The lack of help had increasingly allowed many patients to escape, as well as to be raped, murdered and allowed to commit suicide. In 1987 Governor Bob Casey had the hospital thoroughly searched and observed. The conditions that he discovered made headlines around the country.
Casey placed a gubernatorial order that the hospital should be closed immediately, with the scheduled date of September 30th 1989. However, this was not directly implementable, as Byberry still had a population of 594 in 1987, and disposition was difficult with the limited resources that the state was willing to provide. There was initially a moratorium placed on discharges when two former patients committed suicide following being discharged from Byberry- Tyrone Gainey, age 37, and Joseph Gutgesell, age 31. However, transfers resumed in full in the fall of 1989, following a number of brief investigations. Closure of the site was done slowly, in several phases, building by building, until there were only five patients. The last building closed at Philadelphia State was ‘N-8’, which housed the last patients, who were released by June of 1990.
The dwindling of institutionalization had little impact on the patient population of Byberry. Hospital administrators had transferred 79% of their clinical population to other state facilities, such as Norristown State Hospital and Haverford State Hospital. During the initial round of discharges from Byberry, over 2,500 patients were let out onto the streets of Philadelphia to fend for their own welfare, where many of them remain. The aftermath of the human tragedy of Byberry is still pending, as the City of Philadelphia is still attempting to address the long term consequences of its closing.  In the wake of the closure of such a large facility, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also developed a number of community outpatient clinics for the psychiatric care of the poor in the city. These clinics are still operational, and remain exclusively funded by the City of Philadelphia. They are: Interac CMHMR (BSU# 6A), Northwestern Human Services (BSU# 6B), WES Health Center (BSU #6C), PATH CMHMR(BSU# 7B), Community Council MHMR (BSU# 4), Northwest CMHMR (BSU# 7A), COHMAR (BSU#), John F. Kennedy CMHMR (BSU#1), Hall-Mercer CMHMR (BSU# 2A), CATCH CMHMR (BSU# 2B), Consortium CMHMR (BSU# 3), WES Health Center (BSU# 5A), and Northwestern Human Services (BSU# 7C). It is of note, that the funding initially promised in good faith by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to these clinics following the closure of Byberry, never materialized. Governor Casey proposed $30 million dollars from the state’s budget in 1990. However, only $19 million was actually provided for these Philadelphia clinics. What is more, as of 2013 many clinics operate with significantly limited funding, following large budget cuts made on the part of Governor Tom Corbett.
In the fall of 1991, demolition started with the ‘E’ buildings. Most of their materials had been stripped away prior, and they were all shells of former aesthetic glory. One of the earlier 20th century buildings was salvaged and refurbished, Building ‘E-6’, which still stands today, and is visible from Southampton Road, housing an active outpatient drug rehabilitation clinic. The calculated removal and cleanup of the former state hospital campus amounted to somewhere between $13-16 million, not including the demolition of the physical structures. For the following decade of demolition, the commonwealth decided to leave a number of the more precarious buildings standing, and hired additional security to watch the grounds from potential vandals. In 1997, the warehouses were demolished, followed by ‘C-6’ and ‘C-12’ in 2000, and the laundry building in 2004.
By the late 1990’s the conditions at the former campus had shifted significantly, many of the buildings fell into terminal disrepair. Further, the grounds became an open agora for: building scrappers, the homeless, and angsty teenagers, who further damaged the property. Both local police and campus security were found to be ineffectual at handling the growing illegal traffic taking place on the property. This phenomenon was the exacerbated by the widespread exposure, largely through internet websites, often describing the ruins of the former state facility being ""haunted"". Consequently, a hoard of ""ghost-hunters"" and assorted types descended on the site for the sake of this asinine quest.
In March of 2006, the Westrum Development Corporation purchased the remaining 106-acre Byberry site. They were pressured from Somerton residents, as well as the city, to end the ""Byberry problem"". Westrum moved quickly. By June 7th, there was a chain link fence surrounding the tattered ruins of the property. A week later, truckloads of trees and other natural growth clinging to the buildings was removed, and discarded. On Wednesday, June 14th 2006, a celebration was held in front of ‘C-7’ Building. This was the long overdue ending and renovation of the familiar local ""eyesore"" that Byberry had become. The ceremony consisted of knocking over the overgrown Philadelphia State Hospital sign, a symbol of the sites former activity. In attendance were: Governor Edward Rendell, Mayor John Street, J. Westrum (CEO), and J. Sweeny, CEO of Brandywine Realty Trust, the developers of the new buildings to be built on site. [1] [2]
The single remaining building at the Byberry campus is current being leased to “Self- Help Movement Inc.” (SHM), which has been active on the campus since 1975. They have leased the Daniel Blain Complex since 1983, which consists of three separate buildings, where they currently reside. SHM provides inpatient drug and alcohol treatment, at reasonable costs, for the residents of Philadelphia and it’s suburbs. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania officially sold this piece of the Byberry property to SHM in the spring of 1988. Since that time the complex has been fully refurbished, with most of the Edwardian frills of its original architecture removed.
There was no superintendent of Byberry City Farms prior to 1913. However, those superintendents appointed to their office by the city of Philadelphia are unknown. Additionally, following the national media scandal of Byberry in 1987, superintendent Charles Erb was forced to retire and was not replaced by state officials.

This land was located in Newport Township, Luzerne County along the banks of the Susquehanna River and about 14 miles from Wilkes-Barre. Outdoor pavilions were established to care for the poor on this land until 1878 when a need was seen for additional space and more permanent facilities. A Female Ward was erected in 1878, a Male Ward in1884, and an addition was added to the Male Ward in 1895. Together, these comprised the Luzerne County Almshouse.
By 1890, the District took on the responsibility of caring for mentally ill patients and in 1900 the new Hospital for the Insane opened its door at the site. Sometime between 1921 and 1926 the name was changed to Retreat Mental Hospital, although it was still governed by the Central Poor District of Luzerne County. By an Act of the Legislature in 1937 the haphazard system of Poor Districts was abolished, and County Institution Districts were set up. Though County Commissioners assumed control of poor and indigent sick relief in the counties, management of individual institutions remained the same.
In accordance with an act of 1938 requiring the state to take over all institutions for the care of the mentally ill, Retreat came under state control on September 16, 1943. The Almshouse buildings, whose functions had been superseded by Federal and State relief programs during the Depression, were emptied in 1945 and remodeled into patient dormitories. The Retreat State Hospital was closed in 1980 as a result of decreases in the patient population and cutbacks in the overall budget of the Department of Welfare.
On June 29 of that year(1980), an Executive Order, signed by Governor Richard Thornburgh, transferred the facility to the Bureau of Correction, effective July 1, 1981.  The Bureau was to have temporary responsibility for maintenance and security until the counties could take it over.  The plan never materialized however, so the Bureau retained the property and turned Retreat into a State Correctional Institution.
As of June 2020, Pennsylvania department of corrections closed operations at SCI Retreat. Luzerne county has shown interest in taking over the prison but no tentative plans have been set.",1980 (as a hospital) 2020 (as a prison),"Nanticoke, PA",,"1,103 in 1947"

Jellett Co.,White Pine Camp (1901-1907) | Mount Alto Sanatorium (1907-1918) | South Mountain Sanatorium (1918-1956) | Samuel G. Dixon State Hospital (1956-1965) | South Mountain Geriatric Center (1965-1968) | South Mountain Restoration Center (1968-Present),"In 1762 the town of Mont Alto was founded, the town was supported mainly by a large blast furnace until it closed in 1893. In 1901 the first state sanatorium was built, White Haven, with Elwell Stockdale as the director. The facilities only consisted of an unheated barn and tents until 1902 when several shacks were built using private donations. Each shack was only 8ft by 10ft and held 5 men each.
In 1903 the state legislature donated $8,000 and the first real buildings of White Pine Camp were erected on the grounds. The state money was used to build an assembly building, office building, spring house, and 6 cottages that consisted of 3 rooms, 2 porches, and furniture for each. The sanatorium housed about 30 patients during this time, who paid $1 per week which covered all expenses except laundry. However, there was still no in-house doctor, only a local doctor that made visits to the sanatorium. The state provided another $15,000 in 1905 to build a dining room and kitchen. By 1907 the sanatorium was transferred to the PA Dept of Health and $600,000 was spent on the facility.
An infirmity was built in 1910 where the Vision Quest building is currently located. The infirmary housed patients that were too sick to live in the camp. The patient census grew quickly to 960 patients in 1912. At this time, most of the patients lived in Dixon Cottages. The Dixon Cottages were 26 square feet and could hold up to 8 patients, 56 cottages were built. Patients often lost contact with family members due to mail from the sanatorium being marked “contaminated” and discarded when received at the local post office. In 1915, South Mountain’s first post office was built where Unit 3 now stands. Mail exiting the sanatorium now received proper handling, when it hadn’t previously, and was marked “disinfected”. In 1918, due to the new post office, the sanatorium's name was changed to South Mountain Sanatorium.
In 1920 a second infirmary was built and by 1924 the first infirmary building was converted to a children's hospital. Over the next few years the campus increased dramatically, and the landscape began to change to resemble more of what we see today. Many more buildings were built including a two story nurses home, power plant, and water treatment plant in 1928. From 1931 to 1933 units 4, 8, 11, and 15 were built. Also during that time period another nurse’s home, new infirmary, new dining hall were built and additions were built onto the preventorium.
The state made available $4,765,000.00 to build unit 1, unit 2, unit 3, another nurse’s home, and a dining hall in 1938. The crown jewels of this building frenzy were Unit 1 and Unit 2.
Unit 1 was built at a cost of 1.2 million dollars and is still in existence today (2008). The building is 7 stories tall and constructed primarily out of brick, concrete, terrqzine, rubberized tile, and slate. The walls of Unit 1 are 18” thick, and it was the first building on campus to be constructed with concrete floors. The general contractor was John McShain? Inc. Unit 1 featured operating suites, medical & administration offices, kitchen, dinning room, research labs, morgue, autopsy room, two movie theaters, an auditorium, recreation facility, and head sets for each bed that played two radio stations.
Unit 2 was built at a cost of $600,000 dollars and is still in existence today (2008). The building is 4 stories tall and was designed as a preventorium hospital for children. The building was designed by Morgan Keast and features two wings jutting from a central pavilion. Unit 2 also features 2 indoor pools, library, 4 classrooms, an exercise room, single patient rooms, an auditorium, a movie theater, lounges, and a complete single family home for rehabilitation. The first floor of Unit 1 was for boys and nurses and the second floor was for girls. On Thursday June 22, 1939, while construction was almost complete on Unit 2, an explosion ripped through the west wing, completely destroying it.
In the 1950s Unit 1 was used to house the most critical patients. Men were located in the north wing and women were in the south wing. The worse the patients condition the higher the floor they were on. Unit 2 was for the least ill patients and was less constrictive than Unit 1. Patients in Unit 2 were required to get at least 4 ½ hours of sleep and were allowed to sit on the lawn behind the building and could visit the movie theater in Unit 1. During the 50’s patients at the hospital wore pajamas and bathrobes that fell below the knees, men were required to shave once every 2 days, and smoking was discouraged, but allowed if permitted by a doctor. Patients in Unit 1 were allowed 1 week leave every 6 months and Patients in Unit 2 were allowed 2 weeks. Educational classes were required for children ages 6-18 and were voluntary for the adults. At the information desk in Unit 1 patients could buy bus tickets to anywhere in the United States and Mexico. In 1956 Unit 2 was acquired by the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare to house mentally retarded women. Unit 2 was returned to the Department of Health in 1960.
In the 1950’s, patients could leave the hospital within months as opposed to years. In 1956 until 1968, the hospital was renamed Dr. Samuel G. Dixon. The Samuel G. Dixon State Hospital retained many of the same rules and regulations of previous years with more critical patients being housed in Unit 1. Despite the amount of daily activity at the sanatorium, signs were visible that it’s time as a tuberculosis facility had passed and in 1963, the sanatorium newsletter ‘Spunk’ produced its final edition. In 1965, the sanatorium became the South Mountain Geriatric Center and in February 1966, the Department of Health announced its intent to phase out tuberculosis treatment at the sanitarium to focus more on geriatric patients being housed in mental hospitals. The sanatorium’s name was changed one final time in 1968 to its current name of South Mountain Restoration Center. After a high patient count of about 1,100 in 1970, the center stabilized to approximately 800 and by the early 1990’s, the patient census dropped to 400. In 1992, a company by the name of Vision Quest opened a camp for troubled youths on the grounds and in October 1994, the Cornell Abraxas Leadership Development Program opened a residential training at the center similar to a military school. This group expanded to Unit 3 once all remaining residents were moved to Unit 1 and in 1997, the Secure Treatment Unit, which houses repeat offender youths, opened behind the Nurse’s Home.

On September 1, 1941 hospital operations changed from Somerset County to the Commonwealth, for the care and treatment of patients with mental disabilities. The hospital stood on 1,000 acres, much of which was cultivated or used by dairy farmers. A portion of the hospital's dairy and vegetable needs were met by a truck garden. The hospital added a Social Service Department in September 1957 that included the appointment of the first professionally trained social worker. The facility grew in size to accomodate 775 patients by 1961 and served Somerset and Fayette Counties. Between 1976 and 1979 an annex that had supported mentally disabled patients at Hollidaysburg State Hospital closed and those patients transferred to Somerset State Hospital. The hospital closed in 1995 as part of the movement to deinstitutionalize patients with mental disabilities. The facility was retrofitted and updated in 1996 and transformed into the minimal security Laurel Highlands State Correctional Institution.  [1]
Timeline history of the Somerset County Poor and House of Employment or Somerset State Hospital:
1845-1846 - Land obtained and building known as Somerset County Poor House
1846: The Somerset County House of Employment or “Poor House” opened on what is now Rt. 31 north of the Kimberly Run Preserve. Benjamin Kimmell, Absalom Casebeer and Joseph Imhoff were the first directors, and they purchased a 265-acre farm known as “Fairview” to support the residents. [2]
1800’s -Institution known as Somerset County Poor and House of Employment
1901 – Addition built as New Somerset County Hospital for the Insane (from Directors Report in Meyersdale Commercial Paper dated March 27, 1902).
1900’s- 1946 – Somerset County Poor and House of Employment and County Hospital for the Insane
1938- Somerset State Hospital
1976-1979- Hollidaysburg Hospital closed and patients moved to Somerset State Hospital.
1898 The Somerset County House of Employment was re-opened as the Somerset County Hospital for patients who were mentally ill (Lepley, 1996).
1995 – Somerset State Hospital Closed
1996 – Site changed hands and currently Laurel Highlands State Correctional Institution.  [3]
""The Directors of the poor have recently been giving more than usual attention to the grave yard on the poor farm in which the bodies of the inmates of the County Home are interred, says the Somerset Standard. The old iron fence which was removed from about the court house lawn has been set up around the grave yard and tombstones are being furnished for the graves. The number of bodies now lying in the grave yard is not known, but it is probably not less than two hundred."" [4]
There are actually at least two cemeteries on the grounds - one that is currently inside the razor wire fence, and which was unearthed a few years ago when the prison was doing site preparation for a new building. According to Linda Kurtz, ""they called the forensic department of Mercyhurst College who did the actual digging. They were not able to identify the remains beyond male/female, adult/child, lost a leg, etc.""
A second cemetery is in the wooded area just North of old Building 7 (as it was called during the State Hospital days.) This would be just North of the Northernmost fenced in area.

Pennsylvania,State Hospital for Crippled Children,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=State_Hospital_for_Crippled_Children,,1929,1930,Active,Cottage Plan,,The Pennsylvania State Hospital for Crippled Children in Elizabethtown | Elizabethtown Crippled Childrens Hospital | Elizabethtown Hospital for Children and Youth | State Hospital for Crippled Children at Elizabethtown | Elizabethtown State Hospital,"The Elizabethtown Hospital, originally the State Hospital for Crippled Children at Elizabethtown, was created in 1930 to provide orthopaedic care for children throughout the Commonwealth suffering from bone and joint infections, poliomyelitis, and other musculoskeletal disorders.
The classical revival complex was designed by Thomas, Martin, and Kirkpatrick Architects and built in 1929. In 1933, a nurse’s residence was added because by law nurses could not marry and were required to live on campus. In 1941, two additional wings were built by the Works Progress Administration. Three additional buildings were constructed in 1949. The auditorium, classrooms, and library were constructed in 1965. The first patients were admitted in 1930 to “get a longer lease on life through a $1 million medical research center with special emphasis on the fight to eradicate diabetes and infantile paralysis.”
The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center of Pennsylvania State University took over the hospital in 1972. The facility was re-named Elizabethtown Hospital for Children and Youth operating as a rehabilitation center with an emphasis on occupational therapy determining the patient’s physical, mental, and emotional needs and abilities. The average length of stay for the children in the hospital was fifteen to nineteen months and sometimes years. As late as the 1960's, the average hospital stay for a patient was still a year and the hospital had more than 3,000 visits annually by out-patients. Patient rehabilitation included on campus apartment housing for children and adults transitioning to living at home. The original policy of ending treatment for children when they reached twenty-one was amended to provide continuation of treatment of current or former patients as adults.
During the height of polio epidemics in the 1940's, the brace shop handled 6,000 different on site operations including brace making, shoe corrections, and corset construction. By the 1980's, the brace shop earned national recognition for the custom construction of complex braces, prosthetics, and adaptive seating producing custom seats and chair inserts improving patients’ posture. In 1991, the campus became the Training Academy for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. The academy trains prison employees working for the state and county. Inmates from the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill provide daily maintenance and food service labor and participate in vocational training. The hospital provided comprehensive care on 265 acres with its own farm, dairy, and truck garden. Presently some of the acreage is farmed for the training academy by neighboring farmers. Known as “Academy Woods” sizeable populations of deer herd inhabit the property
In 1990, the clinical programs at the hospital were moved to new quarters on the Hershey Medical Campus and the original hospital was closed. In 1991, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections purchased the property and converted it into a training area for prison employees working for the state and employees working for the county.

Pennsylvania,Torrance State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Torrance_State_Hospital,"June 18, 1915",1919,,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"From the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare web page: Torrance State Hospital opened its doors on November 25, 1919, with the transfer of five (5) patients from Danville State Hospital. At that time, it was generally believed that there was no hope for the chronically mentally ill. Consequently, reflecting the feelings and sentiments of society in general, Torrance State Hospital was opened as a custodial care institution for the chronically mentally ill.
Steadily over the years, the original patient census of five (5) grew to a patient census of 3,300 in the 1950's and 1960's, reflecting the attitudes of society toward mental illness. Treatment procedures at Torrance State Hospital followed the development of psychiatry and included shock therapy, psycho-surgery, psychotherapy and chemotherapy--active attempts at the treatment of mental illness quite distinct from the turn of the century approach of simple custodial care.
With the passage of legislation in 1966, which established the community-based mental health system, the stage was set for what became known as the ""de-institutionalization movement"". Throughout the 1970's to the present, Torrance State Hospital has continued its evolution, ever decreasing its census by affording patients the opportunity to resume community living. The Long Term Care Unit , a licensed Skilled Nursing Facility, was closed in 1996 and the Mental Retardation Unit, which had long been located at Torrance State Hospital, was closed in June 1998. As the need for psychiatric and long-term care beds on the grounds of the state hospital has decreased and availability of community supports has increased, some areas of the physical plant have been converted to other uses. The South West Secure Treatment Unit, a facility operated by the Department of Public Welfare's Office of Children, Family and Youth for adjudicated juveniles is located on the grounds as well as the consumer-operated Drop-In? Center and a Department of Public Welfare Health Insurance Unit. In July 1999, a private provider, Charter Behavioral Health Systems, opened a Psycho-sexual Rehabilitation and Education Program for Adolescent Males, ages 12-20, in an unused building on grounds. The Program is now operated by White Deer Run and is named Cove Prep.
Torrance State Hospital's philosophy and treatment approaches have evolved over the years in direct correlation with the development of best practices in behavioral health care, reflective of research and treatment innovations. Presently, Torrance State Hospital is a dynamic, treatment-oriented, modern psychiatric facility; emphasizing thorough and accurate assessment, appropriate treatment, treatment outcome measurement, accountability and efficiency. Documentation in all treatment and administrative programs is in accordance with the current standards of the various applicable certification and accreditation agencies. Our vision for the 21st Century is to be one of the dynamic providers within the mental health delivery system for Southwestern Pennsylvania, dedicated to the promotion of recovery from mental illness and return to community living.
The geographic catchment area of Torrance State Hospital includes the counties of Armstrong/Indiana, Bedford/Somerset, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Fayette and Westmoreland. In addition, six (6) townships in Northeastern Allegheny County are served by this hospital.
As of 01/31/08 Torrance State Hospital had 229 patients

Pennsylvania,Warren State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Warren_State_Hospital,"August 14, 1873","Sept 10, 1874","Oct 5, 1880",Active,Kirkbride Plan,Sessinghouse and Ostergard,State Hospital for the Insane at Warren | Warren State Hospital for the Insane,"By act of Assembly approved August 14, 1873 (P. L. 333), the Governor of Pennsylvania was authorized to appoint three commissioners to select a site and build a hospital for the insane of the Northwestern district of the state, composed of the counties of Erie, Crawford, Mercer, Venango, Warren, McKean, Elk, Forest, Cameron and Clarion, and for such purpose they were empowered to purchase in the name of the commonwealth a farm or tract of land containing not less than 250 acres. The commission appointed was composed of Dr. William Corson, General James A. Beaver and Dr. John Curwen. General Beaver won distinction during the Civil War, became Governor of Pennsylvania and an associate judge of the Superior Court. The other members of the commission were gentlemen of experience in the state care of the insane. The commissioners entering at once upon their duties purchased three contiguous farms in Conewago township, in the County of Warren, embracing 330 acres, and called to their service John Sunderland, an architect of experience in connection with similar institutions. Meantime the Legislature, by act of May 6, 1874 ( P. L. 117), made appropriation for the erection of the hospital and therein empowered the commissioners to reject all bids for construction ""if, in the opinion of the commissioners, the bids are higher than they can otherwise procure the material or do the work."" Haying ascertained that an excellent quality of gray sandstone, as well as sufficient beds of brick clay, were to be found on the land purchased, the commissioners accordingly rejected all bids, and proceeded to build the hospital under the direction of John Sunderland as supervising architect and builder. By reason of the failure of legislative appropriations to keep pace with the progress of the work, its completion was considerably delayed and the cost incidentally increased. At the end of a period of eight years, however, the building was completed and the commissioners filed their final report. The entire cost was $872,000, or nearly $200,000 less than estimated, notwithstanding that the cost of fireproofing, amounting to about $100,000, was not included in the estimate.
The hospital structure is composed of a main center building and three horizontal sections on each side, at right angles with the center, and connected by transverse wings parallel with the center, and extending back so that each horizontal section shall be fully open at both ends of the main hall. The center building is of four stories, the horizontal wings of three stories, and the transverse blocks of four stories. There are gas works, a greenhouse and water reservoir. The latter was placed on the hill above the hospital, and has a capacity of 1,500,000 gallons. The floors throughout the building are of Georgia pine, the remainder of the wood-' work being walnut, ash and oak. Connected with the building are a laundry, kitchen, machine shop and carpenter shop.
The opening ceremonies were held at the hospital on the 5th of October, 1880. Upon the appointment and organization of a Board of Trustees for the institution, the commissioners, on the 1st day of August, 1881, made a final transfer of the hospital to the trustees, and it was assumed by them.
By the terms of the original act of Assembly the commission was enjoined to select "" good, arable land, with an adequate supply of pure water, having large facilities of drainage from the buildings, within a convenient distance from some town and easy access by railroad."" Charles W. Stone, of Warren, then a member of the Legislature, who was influential in securing the enactment, was able to direct the commission to a location within three miles of Warren which met the designated requirements. In the rear of the hospital, and through its grounds, are the lines of the Dunkirk and Allegheny Valley Railroad and the Warren and Jamestown trolley system.
Colonel Thomas Proctor, journeying in 1791 under commission from General Washington to confer with the Indian chief Cornplanter, noted in his journals that he passed ""the mouth of the Conewago where the government has laid out a manor of 3000 acres,"" and that up the Conewago, ""at an Indian town called Cayantha, or the corn fields, are extraordinary rich lands, of which survey was made by David Rittenhouse, Esq., of Philadelphia, some time since."" Not far southward from the site of Cayantha, in the heart of this rich valley, the hospital *« located. The bluffs, or precipitous hills by which the valley is bordered on the east and on the west, rise to a height of about 2000 feet above the level of the sea, and add their scenic beauty to the hospital environment. The great highway, over the trail which the French explorer Celeron followed in 1749 from the Great Lakes to the Allegheny, here skirts the Conewago.
The principal building stands about 1500 feet from the river bank, towards which the land gradually slopes. The building is approached from the east by a driveway bordered with shrubbery laid out and planted under the direction of the landscape architect, Donald G. Mitchell. In addition to the original site, from time to time other lands have been acquired by purchase until the hospital farm, collectively, now comprises not less than 1044 acres, of which about 174 acres lie on the east bank of the Conewago, in the township of Glade, and 870 acres on the west bank, in the township of Conewago. The hospital farm affords the entire milk supply of the hospital, and a large proportion of its vegetable, meat and fruit supplies, and furnishes employment to patients to whom such employment is beneficial. The farmer and herdsman report a profit for seven years of more than $60,000.
The lands thus acquired, though in some instances not contiguous, are nearly so, and lie on both sides of the Conewago River, which is here the boundary between the townships of Conewago and Glade. While the buildings now constituting the hospital are separated at varying distances, such of them as are not too remote are connected with the principal building by tunnels. The total area of the land is 1044 acres, costing in all $67,109.25.
The hospital was organized under an act of Assembly approved June 8, 1881 (P. L. 83). It authorized the Governor to appoint nine trustees, under the name and title of the ""Trustees of the State Hospital for the Insane at Warren, Pennsylvania."" They were given certain powers therein enumerated, but not the general powers of a corporation, and some question having arisen as to their right to sue, a general law was enacted at their instance investing the trustees of such institutions with full corporate powers (act April 24,1901, P. L. 98). The organic act, however, provided that they should have charge of the ""general interests"" of the institution, and make monthly visitations, either in a body or by committee, appoint a superintendent who shall be a skillful physician, and make by-laws and regulations, with the consent of the Governor, appoint or authorize the appointment of and exercise control over all officers and assistants, and have direction of their duties. It prohibited any change in the office of superintendent oftener than once in five years, but an amendatory act (Act June 25, 1895, P. L. 304) requires an annual appointment.
The first Board of Trustees was commissioned by Governor Henry M. Hoyt and was composed of the following members: L. D. Wetmore, George N. Parmlee, George W. Starr, George W. Wright, James D. Hancock, John Fertig, R. S. Hunt, W. H. Osterhout, and R. B. Stone. Organization was effected by the election of L. D. Wetmore president, and George N. Parmlee secretary.
The commissioners on the 21st of January, 1880, appointed D. D. Richardson, M. D., superintendent and physician. Dr. Richardson was of experience at the Blockley Hospital, and soon after his retirement from the hospital at Warren accepted the superintendency of the State Hospital at Norristown. Entering upon his duties at Warren, Dr. Richardson called to his assistance Dr. Morris S. Guth from a period of hospital service in Iowa and in Ohio. Dr. Richardson, within the year of his appointment, resigned, and was succeeded by Dr. John Curwen, a member of the commission, who, in the exigency caused by Dr. Richardson's resignation, was elected by the trustees at their first meeting. Dr. Curwen, before coming to Warren, had been at the head of the State Hospital at Harrisburg, and, a secretary for many years of the American Association of Medical Superintendents, had attained wide acquaintance with the alienists of this country and was also known abroad, especially among the institutions of Great Britain, which he visited. Somewhat venerable at the close of his service at Warren, he did not long survive his retirement.
Dr. Guth continued in service until his election as assistant physician by the trustees on the 21st of July, 1881, in which position he served until June 15, 1900, when he was elected to the superintendency. Dr. Guth's incumbency was continuous until July 8, 1910, at which time he had been in the constant service of the hospital for a period of 30 years. During his superintendency most of the hospital annexes were erected, and many important features in hospital administration introduced. He acquired a notable reputation as an alienist, and his recent death has been widely lamented.
Dr. W. W. Hawke, who was elected in succession to the superintendency, brought to the office exceptional technical knowledge and a fund of experience gathered at the head of the insane department at Blockley Hospital, but after a short period of service he felt that he could not longer continue in the office with satisfaction, and his resignation was received in the summer of 1911. The vacancy was not immediately filled. The committee named to recommend an appointment finally extended an invitation to Dr. H. \V. Mitchell, then at the head of the state institution at Danvers, Mass., to visit the hospital at Warren, and the invitation was accepted. His unanimous election followed, and he entered upon his duties March 1, 1912. Dr. Mitchell's personal qualities, professional acquirement and experience at the head of important institutions in Maine and Massachusetts give distinct promise of success in his present position.
In the group of 28 buildings and appurtenant domains composing the hospital separate residence is afforded to patients of each sex who are convalescent or slightly affected, to tubercular patients and to the infirm. The buildings for each sex are provided with Turkish baths and with appointments for the amusement, exercise and diversion of patients. Hydrotherapeutic treatment is administered with the most modern equipment. Female patients receive instruction in art, clay moulding, painting, basket weaving and needlework.
This hospital was one of the first to establish a training school for nurses. When it introduced vaccination for typhoid, vaccination for this purpose was not then in use in the hospitals of this country. It sustains a study in psychology and in eugenic records; its pathological department is developing efficiently; it has completed the construction of sewage disposal works, and has equipped the hospital with approved sanitary incinerators. It has acquired three islands in the river, bridged the channels between them, and devoted them to the recreation of patients. It has revised its system of bookkeeping to accord with the best known institutional' examples.
Every department is, however, incidental and tributary to the dominating purpose to heal mental disease through both physical and mental agencies, and to make the environment of the chronic insane both sanitary and comfortable. Daily staff meetings are held, acute cases are considered, assigned for pathological and eugenic report, carefully studied, diagnosed, and reconsidered for treatment, medical, surgical, hygienic or psychological, as may be indicated. Detailed reports filed in each case are made the subject of reference, observation and comparison in the progress of treatment. Every department is under the direction of the superintendent. He is in attendance at all meetings of the Board of Trustees, and is a member ex-offkio of all its committees.
Dr. Guth was the sole assistant physician in the hospital from his election in 1881 until the spring of 1885. The number of assistants has since increased until at present it includes six, besides the pathologist.[1]
From the beginning, the State Hospital was at the forefront of treatment for persons with mental illness. It opened an outpatient clinic in 1885 for people who did not need to be hospitalized and a free clinic was offered two times a month for people who could not pay. At about the same time, a patients' library was established, recreation therapy was instituted and an art teacher was hired. Dr. Curwen retired in 1900 at the age of 79.
Other superintendents continued to make changes. Patients were provided the most current treatments and activities such as fishing, picnics, annual 4th of July outings (which were held on the islands in the Conewango Creek), and an annual Christmas party. A patients' baseball team was formed and it played against local teams. Also, Annual Field Days became a big event for patients in which they participated in a variety of competitive games and events.
The hospital was self-sustaining in that it raised its beef cattle, managed a prize-winning dairy herd, grew and packed its own vegetables. It also had a laundry, bakery and large kitchen. In fact, money from oil, which was discovered on the land, was used to enlarge the farmland. Patients were involved in ""Industrial Therapy"" and in doing so, provided much of the labor for the farm operations, laundry, cannery, grounds keeping, and cleaning.
In 1901 a school for nurses was opened. In 1903 the first class graduated. The school was closed in 1936. By 1916, the patient population had grown to 1116 patients.
Through the years, the hospital changed with the times. The patient population continued to grow and more buildings were erected to accommodate them. In 1920, the name was changed to Warren State Hospital.
Many changes have taken place at WSH over the past 112 years, but throughout its history, it has been committed to providing the best care possible to its patients and to being a leader in treatment of persons with serious mental illness. Today, WSH has the ability to serve 215 patients in treatment (188 Civil, 27 Forensic) and remains an integral and important component in the continuum of care for persons with serious mental illness who reside in northwestern Pennsylvania. The hospital's service area encompasses the following counties: Cameron, Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, McKean, Mercer, Potter, Venango and Warren.

Pennsylvania,Wernersville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wernersville_State_Hospital,"June 22, 1891",1891,,Active,Transition Plan,Rankin & Kellogg,State Asylum for the Chronic Insane,"From the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare web page: The Pennsylvania General Assembly authorized the creation of the State Asylum for the Chronic Insane on June 22, 1891. The facility was to be a public mental hospital for persons needing extended care. Courts were not permitted to make direct admissions to Wernersville; only patients who had at least one year of care at another state mental hospital were eligible for admission. This special role for Wernersville continued until 1923.
Rankin and Kellogg of Philadelphia designed the new hospital buildings, and the overall appearance of the main Administration/residential buildings was modeled after Independence Hall. The total cost for the plant was $472,603.41. The facility plan was considered advanced for the times, as there were no walls surrounding the grounds nor were there bars on the windows and doors. The patients selected were non-violent, but required long-term care. They could freely move in and out of the buildings. The Pennsylvania Legislature's special commission was very impressed by the ""fresh air"" and spring waters in this rural setting in Berks County. The adjacent area had long been recognized for its fashionable resorts attracting many summer visitors from Philadelphia and New York.
Between June 29 and July 5, 1893 100 male patients and 30 female patients were transferred by train from other state hospitals to Wernersville. Since the main building was still under construction, the men occupied the grist mill and the females lived temporarily in the Hain cottage. Everyone was expected to work. The men began establishing the farm program and the women used the kitchen in the cottage to prepare meals for the entire group. Among the new patients was a carpenter and a stonemason and their skills were put to use right away. A stone wall for a pond was built; a dormitory was converted from a barn; tables and benches were constructed for use in the dayrooms; a patient blacksmith made tongues and axles for the wagons. By spring of 1894 the farm was in full operation and the main building was nearing completion for occupation later that summer.
Additional dormitories were finished and housed the men and women, with approximately 46 beds in each dormitory. Attendants also occupied private rooms throughout the new buildings. On the hospital grounds , physical changes were continuous almost from the time the initial construction was completed. Many other facilities were added to the complex and they included a full kitchen, dinning room, chapel, infirmary, employees' cafeteria, bake shop, boiler house, laundry, ice plant, filtration plant, and farm buildings. In the late 1890s a small railroad station was built adjacent to the grounds.
The patient population hovered around 800 and 900 through the hospital's first quarter century. By 1935 it had increased to 1,407, and with the closing of mental health wards at many county hospitals in 1942, Wernersville soared past its planned 1,000 capacity with 1,832 patients. By 1970 the census figure was 1,167; the decrease was due to new treatments and intensive community readiness programs conducted by professional therapists. This deinstitutionalization process continued, and by 1975 the population had been reduced again to 832; by 1992 it was 468.
With the ever-improving advances in psychiatric treatment and pharmacology and the concentration on cooperative discharge planning, Wernersville was able to return more patients to the community in this last decade. Today the current hospital census is 266. The hospital currently works very closely with the mental health programs of the following counties: Berks, Lebanon, Lancaster; York/Adams as of 2005; Lehigh and Northampton as of 2010; and the five Philadelphia counties as of 2019. The ultimate goal of the state hospital program is to prepare the consumers for community living.

Garman,Allegheny County Almshouse | Allegheny Hospital for the Insane | Allegheny County Home for the Poor,"Originally founded as the Allegheny County Home for the Poor in 1854, the hospital was owned and operated by the county government until May 31, 1939 when it was taken over by the state of Pennsylvania along with 11 other county owned mental hospitals.[1] When the state took control of the hospital the Allegheny County Institutional District continued to manage the ""poor"" section of this facility. This arrangement continued until 1958 when the state assumed complete control of all administrative duties. In 1983 the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare proposed closing the hospital, but instead closed the much smaller Dixmont State Hospital in 1984. The hospital was finally closed by the state in 1992. At the time of it's closing the hospital still cared for 460 patients. Each patient was evaluated and either sent to Mayview State Hospital or were put into community care programs.[2] Soon after the closing many of the hospital buildings were torn down as land was divided up and sold. PennDot was the first to build on the former hospital property. Their new 4 million dollar District 11 Headquarters, built on the front lawn of the hospital, was completed the same year the hospital closed.[3] PennDot received scrutiny for spending money on a new building rather than using hospital buildings for it's new headquarters.[4] Former hospital land is also home to a school, shopping mall, and residential developments. As of 2009 the only remnant of the hospital is the power plant smoke stack.
The cemetery remains in a wooded area of the property. A memorial, erected in 1987, stands at the entrance to the cemetery, showing the dates of the cemetery as 1867-1949. The graves do not have names, but are numbered with markers approximately 10"" tall, in neat rows in numerical order. We found up to 692 graves numbered this way. The Pennsylvania State Archives holds 1920 diagram of burial plot locations of deceased patients in the cemetery of the Allegheny County Home for the Insane and Tuberculosis Sanitarium, including first and last name of patients. One hundred and ninety-six burial plots are labeled with their plot number and the name of the person buried there. Additionally, the Collier Township webpage has gathered a list of graveyard numbers, patient name and number, and location on the 1920 census. One grave also has the tombstone of John Nayder - 1868-1932. One additional marker contains initials only of TNDW and CH. All of the photos were taken in March 2008.[5] [6] [7]

Idell,Laurelton Center | Laurelton State Village For Women | Laurelton State Village Farms,"Laurelton State Village started its life as the Laurelton Village for feeble-minded women of childbearing age. Being the first of its kind, the initial concept was intended to detain, segregate, care for, and train feeble-minded women of childbearing age (between the ages of 16 and 45 years). Construction began in 1914 on 230 acres of land, with the first cottage opening in 1917 with 36 residents. Within the next ten years six more buildings were constructed, with the population increasing to 500. The institution was self-sufficient, with residents working on the farm harvesting food, doing laundry and working in the kitchen.
By 1939, all buildings on the grounds had been completed, and included a theater, recreation building, administration offices, two cottages, a power house and several buildings for hospital purposes. Within the administration building, they had a garage, psychological laboratory, a post office and various service and storage rooms; these were all located in the basement floor. There were also board and staff rooms on the first floor, among a number of offices. The second and third floors were used as living quarters for the staff and officials.
In 1969, a radical change took place when the decision was made to admit males into the institution. With the addition of male residents the institution was renamed to the Laurelton State School and Hospital. The Center closed in 1998. The property was purchased by Mountain Valley Inc in 2006, who expressed interest in turning it into a resort among other things. Mountain Valley's plans never came to fruition and was again sold in 2021 to a Juniata County business owner. Plans for the property and buildings were not publicly known as of the time of the sale. On July 2023, a fire destroyed a two story stone cottage, referred to as ""Building No. 2"". The cause was unknown, as the building was vacant.
Plans for the former institution, which once housed mentally-challenged residents, include a conference center and a championship-length, Arnold Palmer Design golf course.
The Hickernell Springs Resort will feature 125 rooms, most of which will be in the former hospital building, with the remaining rooms in surrounding cottages. Also included is a registration area; ballrooms (located in two of the larger buildings on campus); an indoor pool and health spa; an outdoor pool; and at least two restaurants. About five of the cottages may be earmarked for condominiums and sold to corporations for use by employees.
The Palmer course will wrap around the complex, which spans 335 acres and involves 52 buildings. The Laurelton Center was closed in 1998 following a 77-year period as a state-run institution. Besides $7 million budgeted for the golf course, another $24 million is needed to renovate the buildings. About $5 million of that amount will be used to remove asbestos hazards. Two other hazardous disposal sites on the property must also be cleaned up. [1]

Johnson,The Eastern Pennsylvania State Institution for the Feeble minded and Epileptic | Pennhurst State Hospital and School | Pennhurst State School,"The Eastern Pennsylvania State Institution for the Feebleminded and Epileptic was founded by legislative acts of May 15, 1903. Primarily designed as a training school for the feebleminded, it became, through change in the legislative act, a custodial institution as well. Consequently two distinct sections are maintained: one for such epileptic and feeble-minded as require custodial care, and the second for the training of feeble-minded children.
The buildings are erected on a modification of the cottage plan, grouped closely together and connected by corridors. They are two stories in height, of brick and terra cotta, with granite trimmings, and fireproof throughout. They are so arranged as to provide a large number of small rooms occupied by from two to three beds, a few small dormitories with from eight to ten beds, and a large day exercising room.
The patients were fed in a general dining room, with the exception of the ""low grades"" who were housed in a separate building. Initially, a large percentage of patients were admitted voluntarily. Up to March, 1912, no female patients were being received.[1]
From 1903 to 1908 the first buildings were constructed on 633.913 acres of Crab Hill in Spring City, Pennsylvania on what was referred to as the lower campus. Out of the first few buildings constructed, 'F' was the Girl's Dining Room, 'G' was the Kitchen and Store Room, 'H', 'I' and 'K' were a Cottage for Girls, 'N' was the Boys' Dining Room, 'P' was the Teachers Home, 'Q', T', 'U' and 'V' were a Cottage for Boys, 'R' was a School, 'W' was Laundry and Sewing, and 'X' was the Power House. 'P' was used as a temporary Administration building until the institution's opening in 1918 along with the opening of ‘L’ and ‘M’ in 1919. In 1921, Whitman and Wilson I and II were constructed along with Penn Hall for employee housing; in 1929, the Assembly building was complete and functioned as the gymnasium and auditorium. The buildings on lower campus are currently labeled with letters such as 'F', 'I', 'K', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'N', 'U', 'V', 'T', 'W' and 'X' with names later assigned in the 1960's. In 1930, the first buildings on the upper campus, otherwise known as the Female Colony, were completed and named Pershing, Buchanan, Audubon and Keystone. Capitol Hall was erected after World War II along with Devon constructed on lower campus. Horizon Hall opened later in 1971.[2]
The patients would be separated by their intelligence level in different buildings; some could almost function on their own, and others could not feed or bathe themselves. The most severely stricken patients would lie in cribs all day, barely able to move or roll over. The constant attention needed for the patients was a very difficult task to begin with, but when overcrowding became apparent, the care and living conditions became appalling.
A class-action case was filed against Pennhurst State School on behalf of its patients. The case was heard by U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Broderick, who in 1977 ruled that the conditions at the institution violated patients' constitutional rights. Pennhurst State School was ultimately closed in 1987. Its 460 patients were discharged or transferred to other facilities in a process known as deinstitutionalization that lasted several years, and included discussion of treatment plans with each patient's family.[3]
After many years of determining what to do with Pennhurst, congressman Jim Gerlach sought to establish a federal veterans cemetery at Pennhurst in 2003 but the VA rejected the proposal.
In 2005, the state adopted the Keystone Principles concerning the state's duties to maintain historic property and to consult with the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission before transferring the property into private hands. Local County officials supervisors approved a private development and Pennhurst was sold to a developer, Pennhurst Associates, for two million dollars. The Pennhurst Memorial and Preservation Alliance (PMPA) was formed to advocate for certain uses of the site.
Pennhurst was added to the National Register of Historic Places and Pennsylvania's list of the most At-Risk Pennsylvania Properties as well as the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, a worldwide network of historic sites specifically dedicated to remembering struggles for justice.
In partnership with the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia, PMPA obtained a grant to complete a re-use design and feasibility study of the Pennhurst campus.
As of 2010, Penn Organic Recycling LLC currently operates on four-and-a-half-acres of Pennhurst, offering tipping, composting and food waste services. The Department of Environmental Protection permitted the composting operation at Pennhurst to maintain no more than 25 tons.
In 2010 an organization established a ""haunted attraction"" in the former administration building. The attraction is called ""Pennhurst Asylum"" and as of Jan 2012 has run a seasonal ""haunted asylum attraction"" for the last two years. The group has been criticized by preservationists for the damage they have done to the former hospital, such as moving the morgue coolers into the administration building. They also continue perpetuate a bad stigma that is seen by many people about state hospitals.
As of December 2020, only the main building seems to be used for the above mentioned ""haunted attraction"", the other remaining buildings appear to be in various states of Disrepair.

Osterling,State Institution for Feeble-minded of Western Pennsylvania | Polk Center | Polk State Center,"The State Institution for Feeble-minded of Western Pennsylvania was established by act of the State Legislature on June 3, 1893, which act authorized the Governor to appoint five commissioners to select a site and build an institution for the accommodation of the feeble-minded children of Western Pennsylvania.
Under the provision of this act the Governor appointed a commission consisting of the following: Norman Hall, Christopher Heydrick, George A. Jenks, W. Horace Rose and George W. Guthrie.
The site was to consist of a tract of land not less than 500 acres in extent, so located as to be most accessible by railway facilities to the counties of Western Pennsylvania; to be good, arable land, well adapted to the preservation of the health and the occupation and maintenance of the inmates, with an adequate supply of good water and natural facilities for drainage.
The buildings to be of the best design for the construction of such institution, without expensive architectural adornments or unduly large or costly administrative accommodations. The buildings to be in two groups, one for the educational and industrial departments and one for the custodial or asylum department, with such other sub-divisions as will best classify and separate the many diverse forms of the infirmity to be treated. All on such scale as to accommodate not less than 800 inmates, planned and located for easy and natural additions as population demands. The total cost of buildings and grounds not to exceed the sum of $500,000.
The commissioners selected a site of 850 acres at Polk, Venango County, Pa., on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, six miles west of the City of Franklin. The site, which consists of about 400 acres, is beautifully situated on a plateau 1116 feet above sea level, with good drainage and with an abundance of fine spring water. The commission selected F. J. Osterling, of Pittsburgh, as architect, and plans were prepared on a semi-cottage plan.
The group of buildings erected by the building commission consists of an administrative building, gymnasium, dining halls for boys and girls, power house, laundry, separate school buildings for boys and girls and a group of 16 cottages, each with a capacity of 40. On completion of the principal buildings in July, 1896, the institution was transferred from the building commission to a Board of Trustees. The trustees appointed J. M. Murdoch, M. D., formerly of Dixmont Hospital, superintendent in July, 1896, and proceeded at once with the equipment and furnishing of the buildings, which were ready for occupancy April 21, 1897. The first pupils admitted were 153 children transferred from the Pennsylvania Training School at Elwyn, Pa. At this time the institution had a capacity of 800. The institution has since been enlarged by the erection of separate custodial departments for boys and girls, a hospital building and industrial departments. There is now in course of erection a group of buildings to accommodate 330 feeble minded women. With the buildings in course of erection there will soon be accommodation for 2000 patients. Although the institution is particularly for the care and training of feeble-minded children, adults are admitted on pursuing the same course of legal commitment as governs admissions to the state hospitals for the insane. The total cost of the institution to date has been $1,499,161.08.
The activities of the institution are varied. There are 16 groups of boys and 15 groups of girls, and each graded according to their mental condition, and special attention is given to placing the child in the group best suited to its requirements. Each child is individually studied by a skilled physician as to his medical treatment, and mental, physical and moral training. Each child is also assigned to work in class rooms, shops and gymnasiums for the especial purpose of accomplishing what is best in the individual child.
The educational methods are those devised by Dr. Seguin, and consist of simple, impressive exercises rather than the development of abstract ideas. The child is encouraged to use his sense organs, to observe, to note color and form, to hear and note sound, to taste, to smell, to feel, to distinguish between rough and smooth, thick and thin, heat and cold. Especial attention is given to manual and industrial training, because of the conviction that much more will thus be accomplished than by the study of books; and that the future usefulness of the inmates will depend more upon manual dexterity than upon mental ability.
The boys are employed upon the farm and in gardening, clearing the rough land of stones and brush, raising the crops and caring for the live stock. Others are employed in different positions, such as the carpenter shop, tailor shop, shoe shop, mattress and broom shop, in the bakery, and in painting, making mats and hammocks, weaving carpets and rugs, knitting stockings and caps.
The institution is governed by a Board of nine Trustees appointed by the Governor. At present (1914) the Board of Trustees consists of: W. T. Bradberry, president; Marvin F. Scaif e, secretary; O. D. Bleakley, treasurer; S. H. Miller, George S. Criswell, Marshall Phipps, J. N. Davidson, F. H. Coursin, A. R. Smart.
Members of the Board of Trustees who have served prior to the present time: S. M. Jackson, A. E. Patton, John A. Wiley, J. J. Patton, E. W. Echols, Thomas B. Simpson and George F. Davenport.[1]

It is located near the town of Selinsgrove, PA in Penn Township. The facility consists of 51 buildings located on 254 acres of land.[1] Selinsgrove Center opened in 1929 with 180 male epileptics living in three buildings. As part of their treatment they farmed the center's property, more than 1,300 acres at the time. It wasn't until the 1940s that women and children were admitted. The increased population led to expansion. In the 1950s a law was passed that made the Selinsgrove State Colony for Epileptics a facility for the study, care, treatment, education and training for the mentally retarded and the name of the facility was changed to the Selinsgrove State School and Hospital. In the 1970s, the state began an initiative that continues today to place residents of its state centers into community group homes, leading to a slow decrease in population. Today (2009) the center cares for 348 residents, all older than 22, with an average resident age of 58. Nearly 900 employees provide medical and mental health care, physical and speech therapy, nutritional care and pastoral services. A vocational department provides work opportunities to center residents.

Originally located on the north shore of the Ohio River, Allegheny County, the school relocated in 1872 to Morganza, an area northeast of Canonsburg, Pa., in Washington County. The school changed its name in 1876 to the Pennsylvania Reform School. The school was the home of youth under the age of 21, many of whom were convicted of crimes such as theft, larceny, rape, and murder. The school often applied strict discipline policies to force adherence to their rules, and students were often contracted for labor in nearby farms. In 1911, the school, attempting to remove the stigma of a reform school, changed its name to the Pennsylvania Industrial Training School. The school changed its name a fourth time in 1960, to the Canonsburg Youth Development Center. In 1962, renamed Western State School and Hospital, a hospital was added for the mentally handicapped and opened its doors on the campus. The Youth Development Center was eventually phased out of existence, and the mental hospital, eventually named Western Center, utilized some the former reformatory buildings. The facility had 37 buildings on 304 acres of land.
The beautiful campus served as a serene setting in Pennsylvania's history of treatment for the mentally retarded although horrid accounts exist of experimental drug therapy, isolation, neglect, rape and dehumanizing treatment to some residents and faculty throughout the years. Western Center, located in Washington County within the Southpointe business park, stopped admitting patients in 1992 and finally closed in 2000. All of the buildings have been demolished. The land under redevelopment, bought for $2M, will serve as one of the first lifestyle centers in PA which will feature a complex of office, shopping, living, and recreational facilities in one centralized area.
The expansive park-like campus hosts the 20 remaining buildings in various states of decay and disrepair. The seven-story dormitory building looms over the site as the dominant feature. On the opposite end of the campus, a tall green tower tops the brick Administration Building - used as a filming location for the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in 1991 featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.

It was located on a fairly level stretch of ground about halfway up the mountain, on what had been a farm. The buildings consisted of a farm house, which was fitted up as a kitchen, dining room and sleeping quarters for the employees, and a large barn, which was converted into a ""pavilion"", with accommodations for forty patients.
The original purchase of 215 acres was later increased by a gift from the Coxe Family of Drifton PA.,of $800.00, which brought the final acreage up to about 265.
Year by year new buildings were erected from August 1901 until March 1902, seventy-one patients were admitted at an average cost of $5.42 per patient, per week. From 1901 to 1941, the total number of patients treated at White Haven was 25,335, with an annual average of 617.
In 1907 one of the first training schools to provide those who recovered from Tuberculosis with means of livelihood was established at White Haven. In 1909 the first class was graduated and consisted of five nurses. From 1909 to 1942, White Haven graduated 275 nurses.
Jefferson Medical College accepted the gift of the Sanitorium, complete and outright in 1946 and operated it until March 1, 1956, when the diminishing number of Tuberculosis patients made it mandatory to close the Sanitorium.
It was accordingly sold to the State of Penna. to be used for the care of the Mentally Retarded and starting March 5,1956 was known as Pennhurst State School Annex #2, a sub-division of the Institution at Spring City, Penna. with over 463 patients between the ages of 16 to 60.
When the State of Penna took over White Haven, March 5, 1956, as a Pennhurst Annex, it was a school for the Mentally Retarded. It's first day of operation was two days later and 30 patients were in attendance during the week, as working patients, getting the site ready for occupancy. These patients came from Pennhurst, where they spent the week-ends.
The first permanent patients to arrive at White Haven, totaled 25, on March 23, 1956. This grew to a capacity of 463 by the end of the year.

Beginning with the donation of the land by steel tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and prescribed by the Act of Assembly in June 1910, the Cresson Tuberculosis Sanatorium was opened in 1916. The location was considered as ideal due to the abundance of fresh air and the treatments used to combat the disease. The present administration building was built in the European style with gargoyles on the tower and the crests of Scottish clans cut into the sandstone as a reminder of Mr. Carnegie’s heritage.
With the introduction of new drugs and treatments for tuberculosis, the need for sanatoriums declined. In December of 1956 the facility was incorporated into the Lawrence F. Flick State Hospital being run by the Department of Public Welfare to treat the mentally retarded. The facility remained in operation until December 1982.
In 1983 the facility was converted into a state correctional institution under the Bureau of Corrections. Under Executive Order 1983-1, Governor Dick Thornburgh directed that the Bureau of Correction convert the facility to a state correctional institution. Total allocation for design and renovation was $20.6 million. First Lady Ginny Thornburgh, as an advocate of the mentally retarded, requested that the cemetery used by the facility since its inception be maintained as a memorial by the institution. Today the maintenance department and the inmates of SCI Cresson carry on this work.
Construction and renovation began in 1984. Many buildings were renovated with the addition of fire safety, environmental and security equipment. The design for the new housing units for inmates became the prototype for institutions being built across the state. The director’s home was moved from inside the future compound to a site on the road leading to the institution and became the superintendent’s residence.
In the fall of 1986, the SCI Cresson Staff Activation Team was assembled with Jeffrey A. Beard, Ph.D., as superintendent; Martin Dragovich, deputy superintendent for centralized services; Donald Morder, deputy superintendent for operations; David Lewis, business manager; Elizabeth Eckenrode, personnel director; Robert Whitsel, facility maintenance manager; and Lisa (Godish) Beiswenger, superintendent’s secretary. In August, the first inmate work cadre of 10 inmates arrived from SCI Huntingdon. Later, all of these inmates were assigned to SCI Cresson.
The prison closed June 30, 2013 and the land was put up for sale by the state. Big House Produce bought the property in late 2019. They are an indoor hydroponic agricultural farm that also provides tours and photography trips scheduled for the general public.

Its name was changed in 1956 to the Charles H. Miner State Hospital at Hamburg. In 1959, with the advent of effective medicine to defeat tuberculosis the hospital closed as a sanitarium. This closure was brief however, and the ownership was transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Public Welfare and renamed The Hamburg State School and Hospital.
In January 1960, the facility re-opened as a center for people with mental retardation. In 1976 it was renamed its current name, Hamburg Center. To this day the Hamburg Center continues to carry out its mission of providing care and services to people with intellectual disabilities, with a goal of helping them learn to live independently in the community. At one time, more than 900 people lived at Hamburg Center. Today, the center has 122 occupants, many with physical as well as mental challenges. Hamburg consists of 43 buildings located on 154 acres of land and is a 269 bed intermediate care facility.
Hamburg Center provides a wide range of services and programs, including recreational programs, living skills and vocational training, occupational and physical therapy, speech therapy, psychological and social services, and medical and dental care. These services are all intended to help people develop the skills they will need for independence within the community.

Dixon State Hospital (1956-1965) | South Mountain Geriatric Center (1965-1968) | South Mountain Restoration Center (1968-Present),"In 1762 the town of Mont Alto was founded, the town was supported mainly by a large blast furnace until it closed in 1893. In 1901 the first state sanatorium was built, White Haven, with Elwell Stockdale as the director. The facilities only consisted of an unheated barn and tents until 1902 when several shacks were built using private donations. Each shack was only 8ft by 10ft and held 5 men each.
In 1903 the state legislature donated $8,000 and the first real buildings of White Pine Camp were erected on the grounds. The state money was used to build an assembly building, office building, spring house, and 6 cottages that consisted of 3 rooms, 2 porches, and furniture for each. The sanatorium housed about 30 patients during this time, who paid $1 per week which covered all expenses except laundry. However, there was still no in-house doctor, only a local doctor that made visits to the sanatorium. The state provided another $15,000 in 1905 to build a dining room and kitchen. By 1907 the sanatorium was transferred to the PA Dept of Health and $600,000 was spent on the facility.
An infirmity was built in 1910 where the Vision Quest building is currently located. The infirmary housed patients that were too sick to live in the camp. The patient census grew quickly to 960 patients in 1912. At this time, most of the patients lived in Dixon Cottages. The Dixon Cottages were 26 square feet and could hold up to 8 patients, 56 cottages were built. Patients often lost contact with family members due to mail from the sanatorium being marked “contaminated” and discarded when received at the local post office. In 1915, South Mountain’s first post office was built where Unit 3 now stands. Mail exiting the sanatorium now received proper handling, when it hadn’t previously, and was marked “disinfected”. In 1918, due to the new post office, the sanatorium's name was changed to South Mountain Sanatorium.
In 1920 a second infirmary was built and by 1924 the first infirmary building was converted to a children's hospital. Over the next few years the campus increased dramatically, and the landscape began to change to resemble more of what we see today. Many more buildings were built including a two story nurses home, power plant, and water treatment plant in 1928. From 1931 to 1933 units 4, 8, 11, and 15 were built. Also during that time period another nurse’s home, new infirmary, new dining hall were built and additions were built onto the preventorium.
The state made available $4,765,000.00 to build unit 1, unit 2, unit 3, another nurse’s home, and a dining hall in 1938. The crown jewels of this building frenzy were Unit 1 and Unit 2.
Unit 1 was built at a cost of 1.2 million dollars and is still in existence today (2008). The building is 7 stories tall and constructed primarily out of brick, concrete, terrqzine, rubberized tile, and slate. The walls of Unit 1 are 18” thick, and it was the first building on campus to be constructed with concrete floors. The general contractor was John McShain? Inc. Unit 1 featured operating suites, medical & administration offices, kitchen, dinning room, research labs, morgue, autopsy room, two movie theaters, an auditorium, recreation facility, and head sets for each bed that played two radio stations.
Unit 2 was built at a cost of $600,000 dollars and is still in existence today (2008). The building is 4 stories tall and was designed as a preventorium hospital for children. The building was designed by Morgan Keast and features two wings jutting from a central pavilion. Unit 2 also features 2 indoor pools, library, 4 classrooms, an exercise room, single patient rooms, an auditorium, a movie theater, lounges, and a complete single family home for rehabilitation. The first floor of Unit 1 was for boys and nurses and the second floor was for girls. On Thursday June 22, 1939, while construction was almost complete on Unit 2, an explosion ripped through the west wing, completely destroying it.
In the 1950s Unit 1 was used to house the most critical patients. Men were located in the north wing and women were in the south wing. The worse the patients condition the higher the floor they were on. Unit 2 was for the least ill patients and was less constrictive than Unit 1. Patients in Unit 2 were required to get at least 4 ½ hours of sleep and were allowed to sit on the lawn behind the building and could visit the movie theater in Unit 1. During the 50’s patients at the hospital wore pajamas and bathrobes that fell below the knees, men were required to shave once every 2 days, and smoking was discouraged, but allowed if permitted by a doctor. Patients in Unit 1 were allowed 1 week leave every 6 months and Patients in Unit 2 were allowed 2 weeks. Educational classes were required for children ages 6-18 and were voluntary for the adults. At the information desk in Unit 1 patients could buy bus tickets to anywhere in the United States and Mexico. In 1956 Unit 2 was acquired by the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare to house mentally retarded women. Unit 2 was returned to the Department of Health in 1960.
In the 1950’s, patients could leave the hospital within months as opposed to years. In 1956 until 1968, the hospital was renamed Dr. Samuel G. Dixon. The Samuel G. Dixon State Hospital retained many of the same rules and regulations of previous years with more critical patients being housed in Unit 1. Despite the amount of daily activity at the sanatorium, signs were visible that it’s time as a tuberculosis facility had passed and in 1963, the sanatorium newsletter ‘Spunk’ produced its final edition. In 1965, the sanatorium became the South Mountain Geriatric Center and in February 1966, the Department of Health announced its intent to phase out tuberculosis treatment at the sanitarium to focus more on geriatric patients being housed in mental hospitals. The sanatorium’s name was changed one final time in 1968 to its current name of South Mountain Restoration Center. After a high patient count of about 1,100 in 1970, the center stabilized to approximately 800 and by the early 1990’s, the patient census dropped to 400. In 1992, a company by the name of Vision Quest opened a camp for troubled youths on the grounds and in October 1994, the Cornell Abraxas Leadership Development Program opened a residential training at the center similar to a military school. This group expanded to Unit 3 once all remaining residents were moved to Unit 1 and in 1997, the Secure Treatment Unit, which houses repeat offender youths, opened behind the Nurse’s Home.

It was located on a fairly level stretch of ground about halfway up the mountain, on what had been a farm. The buildings consisted of a farm house, which was fitted up as a kitchen, dining room and sleeping quarters for the employees, and a large barn, which was converted into a ""pavilion"", with accommodations for forty patients.
The original purchase of 215 acres was later increased by a gift from the Coxe Family of Drifton PA.,of $800.00, which brought the final acreage up to about 265.
Year by year new buildings were erected from August 1901 until March 1902, seventy-one patients were admitted at an average cost of $5.42 per patient, per week. From 1901 to 1941, the total number of patients treated at White Haven was 25,335, with an annual average of 617.
In 1907 one of the first training schools to provide those who recovered from Tuberculosis with means of livelihood was established at White Haven. In 1909 the first class was graduated and consisted of five nurses. From 1909 to 1942, White Haven graduated 275 nurses.
Jefferson Medical College accepted the gift of the Sanitorium, complete and outright in 1946 and operated it until March 1, 1956, when the diminishing number of Tuberculosis patients made it mandatory to close the Sanitorium.
It was accordingly sold to the State of Penna. to be used for the care of the Mentally Retarded and starting March 5,1956 was known as Pennhurst State School Annex #2, a sub-division of the Institution at Spring City, Penna. with over 463 patients between the ages of 16 to 60.
When the State of Penna took over White Haven, March 5, 1956, as a Pennhurst Annex, it was a school for the Mentally Retarded. It's first day of operation was two days later and 30 patients were in attendance during the week, as working patients, getting the site ready for occupancy. These patients came from Pennhurst, where they spent the week-ends.
The first permanent patients to arrive at White Haven, totaled 25, on March 23, 1956. This grew to a capacity of 463 by the end of the year.
During the 1960's the name of the Institution was changed from Pennhusrt to White Haven State School, and in 1962 was amended to White Haven State School and Hospital; and in 1961 was divorced from Pennhurst to become independently under State Supervision.

A 1909 advertisement identified ""incipient and moderately advanced cases."" The capacity was noted at 25 cases. Rates ranged from $12 to $25 per week (in 1909). The Adams County News (Gettysburg) stated that Dr. A. Barr Snively dismantled and closed the sanatorium on April 22, 1916.
The US listings of Sanatorium (in 1909) listed Dr. A. Barr Snively as the resident physician and medical director. It also listed a superintendent, Florence M. Gottshall. In 1910 two nurses (Ella Watson and Florence Gottshall) and a servant (Geo. Davis) were listed among the staff.

Cohen in Philadelphia. Their goal was to open a sanatorium near Philadelphia that would treat indigent individuals suffering from tuberculosis, which was the leading cause of death in Europe and North America. At that time, substance abuse was not recognized as a disease requiring treatment. Known also as the ""white plague,"" tuberculosis did not discriminate; it imposed itself on all levels of society. Unfortunately, impoverished individuals who were afflicted with the disease had a low chance of survival because treatment options were limited and costly.
Under the direction of Dr. Cohen and several other professionals, the groundwork for such a challenging and ambitious project came to fruition. The group purchased a country farm from one of Dr. Cohen’s former tuberculosis patients, who had recovered from the disease and returned to their Philadelphia residence. One of Dr. Cohen’s original supporters, Solomon C. Krauss, offered the owner $100 of his own money as a down payment on the land which was obtained for $6,500.
As one of the founders of the Philadelphia Jewish Sanatorium for Consumptives, as it was first called, Mr. Krauss and other dedicated and generous individuals, began the transformation of a country farm into a fully operational tuberculosis hospital. Less than eight months from the first meeting, on September 16, 1909 the sanatorium opened its doors to four patients. Those suffering from the white plague received unparalleled treatment and compassion during their stay at the sanatorium. Through the decades the sanatorium continued to grow. In 1959, the sanatorium celebrated ""Fifty Years of Progress in the Treatment of Tuberculosis.""
The sanatorium was affiliated with several professional organizations, and was a member of the Philadelphia Hospital Council, the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, the American Hospital Association, Delaware Valley Hospital Council, and the Federation of Jewish Agencies. This facility stood in contrast to the public facilities for the treatment of consumption, such as those on the asylum grounds at 
Norristown State Hospital, which stood only a mile and a half away.
By the mid-1960s there were numerous changes in the medical field. The state had taken over the treatment of tuberculosis, and streptomycin and other antibiotics were discovered to effectively treat tuberculosis. Eagleville had to seriously reconsider its mission as a tuberculosis sanatorium, as at that time their wards were nearly empty. Dr. Donald Ottenberg, the new medical director of Eagleville, persuaded the board members to convert the facility into a specialized treatment center for men who suffered from addiction to alcohol. On July 28, 1965 the sanatorium officially changed its name to Eagleville Hospital, specializing in the treatment of alcohol addiction and in the winter of 1966 the first of such clients arrived for such treatment. The switch from Sanitarium to Drug Rehabilitation Center included a number of renovations to the old building to accomodate the new cliental.
In 1968, Eagleville pioneered a new approach to addiction treatment adding a program for drug addiction. The treatment programs were expanded in 1969 when Eagleville admitted the first women to the hospital for the treatment of substance abuse. Eagleville’s growth as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility progressed to include a variety of community outreach programs. To become more accessible to individuals suffering from addiction, the hospital established a halfway house and a day hospital in Norristown, and counseling and therapy programs for prisoners at Graterford. The hospital also initiated education programs such as the Montgomery County Community Day School program, which offered an alternative to institutionalization for troubled adolescents. Eagleville was also instrumental in the creation of a performance based master's degree program in human services offered through Lincoln University. The program accepted students on the basis of proven experience and requisite academic skills.
Eagleville continued to expand under Dr. Ottenberg and its new clinicalmission. In 1975, Eagleville opened Family House, a nationally recognized program that provided residential treatment for recovering alcoholics and drug addicted women and their children. Although it is no longer under the management of Eagleville, Family House continues to fulfill its original mission. Through the decades, Eagleville has earned national recognition and attracted medical students and doctors from around the world interested in learning about the Hospital's treatment techniques. Dr. Ottenberg retired as medical director in 1982, after seventeen years.
Governed by the Eagleville Foundation, Eagleville Hospital is state licensed and accredited with commendation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). Eagleville Hospital provides a variety of programs including medically supervised detoxification, specialized inpatient programs for men and women, a medical specialty unit, dual diagnosis programs, and non-hospital programs.
Over the years, healthcare systems have experienced many changes. However, under the inspired leadership of the Eagleville Foundation, Eagleville Hospital continues the mission which began over a century ago. Eagleville continues to offer high quality residential care to those in need of treatment for alcohol and drug addiction. Eagleville Hospital continues to provide new and better ways to treat addictive disease, using the most recent techniques, delivered by skilled professionals.[1]

Pennsylvania,Grand-View Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Grand-View_Sanatorium,1911,,,Closed,Single Building,,,"The first person to be attracted to South Mountain with a view to establishing a health center was Dr. Charles E. Leisenring, a native of Germany. He had come to southeastern Pennsylvania for the single purpose of building a sanatorium. After investigating possibilities in Ephrata, Lancaster County, and the various springs close to the city of Reading, he decided that these spots, although good, could not assure him of the abundant supply of water that he needed for his enterprise.
Cushion Hill on South Mountain suited Leisenring's purpose. Between 1847 and 1855 he built his first cottages and covered the springs which he found in his newly acquired 50-acre plot. His venture was known by various names, most common of which was ""Cushion Hill Water Cure,"" another, ""Cold Spring Water Cure"" and sometimes ""Mountain Resort."" Leisenring's death in June 1857 cut short the extension of his elaborate plans. The establishment was operated by a ""Mr. Adolphus"" (first name not known) until 1865, when the property was purchased by Dr. and Mrs. Aaron Smith. Both Dr. Smith and his wife were graduated from a School of Hydropathy. They renamed the place ""Hygiean Home,"" in order to distinguish its purposes from the ""water cure"" of Dr. Leisenring. The Smiths introduced many new practices such as massages, ""electrical treatments"" and the like. They expanded the buildings, added new ones and operated successfully from 1865 to 1873.
Dr. Reuben D. Wenrich and Dr. James W. Deppen, two local physicians, purchased the property from the Smith estate (1879), renaming it Grand-View Sanatorium. The main building (now known as the Hotel) was enlarged to a size that would accommodate 150 guests.
Its situation commanded a magnificent view of the Lebanon Valley. The solarium on the sixth floor was enclosed in glass; here, those suffering from rheumatism, nervous exhaustion and other ailments could bask in the sunshine, securing the benefits of a southern climate.
The diseases treated were principally those of a chronic but curable character. The physicians considered the climate especially helpful for catarrhal conditions, rheumatism, gout, nervous prostration and liver complaints. Their treatments other than medical included massage, electricity in various forms, salt rubs, vapor and sulphur baths.
The ""Pavilion Spring"" water which had proven most beneficial in kidney, liver, and stomach diseases was well known. Water from this spring was sold in nearly every state in the union. In 1890 the price of 1 bbl., 40 gallons, was $6.00; 1/2 bbl., $3.50; 1 case of 12 1/2 gallon bottles, $2.70; 5 gallons in 1/2-gallon bottles, $2.00, delivered f.o.b. Wernersville.
The Grand-View Chapel (non-sectarian) is a beautiful edifice, built of gray limestone, with stained glass windows, and has a seating capacity for 100 people. The chapel is surrounded on all sides by evergreen and dogwood trees, which give it a very picturesque setting.
After the death of Dr. Deppen in 1895, Dr. Wenrich continued operating the ""Grand-View."" He had as his associates his two sons, Dr. George G. and Dr. John A. Wenrich. Dr. William F. Muhlenberg and Dr. Daniel B. D. Beaver of Reading were consulting physicians and surgeons.
This sanatorium was closed after Dr. Reuben Wenrich's death in 1926. The main building is still standing, but has never again been occupied as a health resort. Today the major portions of Grand-View are owned hy two brothers, Anthony and Sebastian Bodanza. [1]",,Berks County,,
Pennsylvania,Markleton Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Markleton_Sanatorium,,,,Closed,Single Building,,United States Army General Hospital No. 17,"Markleton Sanatorium was originally a private hotel-like sanatorium where guests would visit for relaxation as well as treatment from every day ""illnesses"" like stress. The sanatorium would later be converted for use by the US Army as a tuberculosis sanatorium.
The sanatorium was situated on the main line of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, between Cumberland and Pittsburg. It was nestled among the mountains at an altitude of 1,700 feet, which shut it in on both the east and the west, and was, therefore, not exposed to the cold winds of the winter. Its main building was a five-story, steam-heated, brick structure, with north and south frame wings, each of which was 150 feet long. Water was supplied from numerous springs high up on the mountain side. The sanatorium had baths of salt, electric, Turkish, and vapor. The original building had a capacity of 150. The town of Markleton comprised, mainly, the railroad station, 2 stores, and about 20 small dwellings located along the railroad tracks to a coal mine about three-fourths of a mile distant. The nearest town of any size was Rockwood, about 7 miles away.
In January, 1918, the sanatorium was a in poor state of repair. It was offered to the Government, for lease or sale. A representative of the Surgeon General's Office inspected it, and, on February 5, the Surgeon General recommended that it be leased for use as a general hospital in the care and treatment of tuberculosis. The recommendation was approved, and the lease was executed February 25, 1918. Included in the transaction were the sanatorium, with its complete equipment, a laundry and cold-storage plant, a power plant, outbuildings, several farmhouses, and 100 acres of land, all obtained for a rental of $20,000 a year. Under a separate agreement, some cottages were leased for use as quarters for nurses on duty at the hospital. The designation General Hospital No. 17 was given on March 21, 1918; it was opened in the following month, with a bed capacity of 100,86 and was soon filled.
At the time General Hospital No. 17 was secured, the need for additional beds for tuberculosis patients in general hospitals was pressing, and it was exceedingly difficult to find suitably located places that could be used for the treatment of tuberculosis, and even more difficult to induce owners of properties to lease them: they were decidedly averse to the use of them for hospitals for the tuberculous. These almost insurmountable difficulties influenced the selection of the comparatively undesirable Markleton Sanatorium. It was not well suited to general hospital purposes; it was small and would not have permitted of an economical expansion by the construction of a sufficient number of buildings to constitute a hospital that would be on a par with the general hospitals then being provided. It was estimated that between 300 and 400 patients could be cared for; however, the subsequent history of the hospital, not unlike those of General Hospitals Nos. 13, 15, and 18, proved the fallacy of this estimate.
On March 4, 1918, personnel was sent to the hospital, and its renovation and alteration were begun. Following this, the construction of six tuberculosis wards, in the vicinity of the main building, was authorized and started. This temporary construction was stopped, however, after three buildings had been built. At one time, in the summer of 1918, the abandonment of the hospital was considered; but the entertainment of the idea was dropped: there was too much uncertainty regarding future military necessities. It developed at this time, too, that the lesson had been led to understand that the sanatorium had been leased for not only the period of the war, but one year thereafter, and that it was mainly because of this understanding that he had been induced to permit the discontinuance of the sanatorium, as such, and to enter into a lease with the Government.
Later in the fall available bed space for the tuberculous became critical, and further construction at this hospital was requested, but, because of the armistice, was not consummated.  The maximum bed capacity of the hospital was 200. This bed capacity had been attained by August, 1918, coincident with the number of patients under treatment. Both bed capacity and the number of patients remained at that figure until the hospital was closed on March 27, 1919.
Being a hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis, the development of physical reconstruction activities was attempted, but, due to the small size of the hospital, the results, as obtained elsewhere, were not secured.[1]

Pennsylvania,Mountain Park Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mountain_Park_Sanatorium,,,,Closed,Single Building,,,"During the interval between 1873, the end of the Smith family's operation of the Hygiean Home (Grand-View) and its purchase by Drs. Wenrich and Deppen (1879) the resort was leased from the Smith estate by Dr. Robert Walter and his wife, Eunice, also a physician.
During his three-year tenure at the Hygiean Home, Dr. Walter came to the conclusion that some other establishment was needed to combine all of his ideas. His own youth had been spent as an invalid, forced to move from one curative institution to another.
At one point, in 1868, he records that he was ""at the point of death."" He attributed his own recovery to a combination of pure air, fresh water, exercise, the Swedish movement, massage, and electrical applications of various types.
In 1876, he founded the institution which, for many years, bore his name as Walter's Park, on South Mountain, below Wernersville. Of his method of treatment he said in 1909:
This system of treatment was first organized at Wernersville by myself and its success is best declared by the innumerable institutions throughout the country who have adopted the title and administered the treatment as best they know. Dr. Robert Walter was indeed an individualist. The inscription he wrote for his tombstone (located in Hain's Church Cemetery, Wernersville) five years before his death (1921) provides an insight into his personality and belief: WALTER-Dr. Robert Walter, twice paralyzed and pronounced hopelessly incurable, has carried a so-called heart disease for sixty years; impoverished through medical empiricism in 1873, he came to Wernersville burdened with a great idea, but aided by a noble help-meet, began a system of health treatments entirely new, with results of surpassing importance to himself and 15,000 others. Hence, THE TRUE SANATORY IDEA, the power of life derivable from the patient is the only power of cure. All medicaments which appear to increase this power, do instead reduce it through expenditure and tend to prevent recovery, all the while they appear to be promoting it. This was Walter's conclusion after ten years' experience, now confirmed by 50 years' verification. The Just Shall Live by Faith, the Only Scientific Basis.
At the time of its greatest development, Walter's Park comprised 500 acres of mountain land. The main building was 300 feet long and five stories high. Built like a medieval castle it snuggled against the green slopes of South Mountain, a beautiful sight to behold from any vantage point in the Lebanon Valley to the north.
""No malaria, no mosquitoes, no dew"" was a proud boast of Walter's Park. Many distinguished guests sought its shelter, among them the widow of General Stonewall Jackson and the great statesman, William Jennings Bryan. The place was equipped with electric lights, a hydraulic elevator, a circulating library, and a livery stable which featured standard-bred horses for riding. Pool, billiards, tennis, bowling, croquet and many other diversions were offered discerning guests.
After the death of Dr. Walter, the ""park"" became the property of a corporation which renamed the spot ""South Mountain Manor"" and for a number of years thereafter it continued to supply some of the services which the former institution had offered.
In more recent years it became the headquarters for a sporting fraternity, attracting mountain-lovers from nearby metropolitan areas. Today it is a ""white elephant"" owned by a Philadelphia textile manufacturer and his associates. [1]",,Berks County,,
Pennsylvania,Overlook Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Overlook_Sanitarium,,,,Active,Single Building,,Overlook Medical Clinic,"In the early 1900’s, Dr. Elizabeth McLaughry, a New Castle-based physician, had a dream to open a medical facility catering to the needs of those suffering from “nervous disorders.” Elizabeth was born into a prosperous family in New Wilmington, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, in September 1865, had graduated from Westminster College in 1887, attended medical school in Philadelphia, studied nervous disorders throughout Europe, and opened her own practice in New Castle in 1895. She was one of the first (if not the actual first) certified female doctors to hail from the New Castle area.
Her family was very well-known throughout the region and included her brother James A. McLaughry, an educator and attorney who became a longtime judge in Mercer County, her nephew DeOrmond “Tuss” McLaughry, a future college football player and coach who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1962, and her older sister Margaret McLaughry, an accomplished medical doctor in her own right.
To make her dreams come true Elizabeth had a twenty-eight room facility, known as the Overlook Sanitarium, built on her family’s hilltop property overlooking the quiet college town of New Wilmington. The facility opened on June 7, 1911, with Elizabeth serving as its first medical director. She led a small staff that primarily treated psychological disorders, but also dealt with troublesome physical illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. The vast grounds of the sanitarium featured a scenic view and the staff made sure the patients enjoyed the outdoors as a sort of mental therapy. Elizabeth’s sister Margaret, also a part owner of the facility, served as the superintendent.
The facility, which specialized in convalescent care, became a renowned mental health institution in the region and also took patients from all over the country. Elizabeth McLaughry would receive great praise for her work at the Overlook and in the local community. Unfortunately, her sister Margaret took a nasty fall exiting a church in New Wilmington and injured her hip in June 1926. She died of complications from the injury a few months later at the age of seventy-two.
Elizabeth continued her work and oversaw the effort to build an addition to the Overlook in late 1927-28. It was not until 1945, when she was about to turn eighty years old, that she finally stepped down as medical director. Her niece, Elizabeth Veach Hayden, a part-owner and accomplished mental health physician, succeeded her. The elder Elizabeth, one of New Wilmington’s most prominent citizens, continued to stay involved in the community until she passed away on December 7, 1967, at the age of 102. She was buried in Fair Oaks Cemetery in New Wilmington.
In 1968-69, a major two-wing addition, which cost about $400,000, was constructed at the Overlook and increased the capacity to about seventy patients. The new wings were named for Elizabeth McLaughry and dedicated in her honor. At about the same time the Overlook evolved away from the mental health field and became an extended care nursing home. The McLaughry family continues to operate the Overlook to this day.[1]

Pennsylvania,Ashland State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ashland_State_Hospital,1880,1880,1882,Closed,Single Building,,State Hospital for Injured Persons of the Anthracite Coal Region at Fountain Springs | Ashland Regional Medical Center | Ashland State General Hospital | Saint Catherine Medical Center Fountain Springs,"NOTE: Ashland State Hospital was one of many hospitals built for coal miners in Pennsylvania, these hospitals were also referred to as state hospitals, this hospital was not a psychiatric facility.
In the mid-1870’s, coal mining was a booming industry in this area. Thousands of miners went to work daily and, unfortunately, many were injured on the job, with no provisions for their care. If they could survive the trip, injured workers were given passage on the railroad to obtain care in a large city, such as Philadelphia. Otherwise they were sent home to be treated by family and/or to die.
The need for better medical care was evident, and in 1879, state legislation was approved to form the State Hospital for Injured Persons of the Anthracite Coal Region at Fountain Springs. Construction of the new hospital began in May 1880 and was completed in 1882. The original building included several wards, an Administrative wing, operating rooms, laundry and a stable.
The first patient, John Lucas from Shenandoah, was admitted on November 14, 1883, following an injury at the Kohinoor Colliery. Originally the hospital could only accept injured miners, railroad workers and textile workers, in that priority order. No women or children, nor non-injured persons (i.e. serious illness) would be accepted as patients until the early 1900’s. Over the years, the mission of the hospital evolved to include care not only for injured workers, but also for their families and eventually for community members requiring professional medical care. Saint Catherine Medical Center continues to build on this tradition and the strong family values of the residents of Schuylkill County, while planning for the future healthcare needs of the community.
In the early 1960’s, it was clear that a new hospital needed to be built. The current building was completed in 1967 and the original building was demolished.
The state divested many of the state-owned/operated hospitals, including Ashland State General Hospital, in the 1990’s. Since then, Ashland Regional Medical Center had several owners.
The hospital's new owner purchased the property on May 1, 2006 and changed the name to Saint Catherine Medical Center Fountain Springs. It served the community as a general hospital until it's closing in April 2012.
In March 2015, Ashland Properties LLC of San Clemente, California, bought the 20.7-acre property in Butler Township for $550,000, according to the deed filed Monday in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. It is estimated that they will spend $4 million to $5 million to renovate the former medical center in which they plan to handle mental health and substance abuse treatment for people of all income levels, according to Beau M. Brown, a broker with Bennett Williams Realty Inc., York, the Realtor that facilitated the sale. Approximately 200 people eventually will work at the facility, according to Brown.

Established June 14, 1887, the Blossburg State Hospital was also known as Cottage State Hospital. The first hospital building in 1890 was a cottage style frame structure housing 15 beds. Situated on a hilltop overlooking a community of 2,000 persons, the state institution originally was intended to serve miners and their families in that bituminous and semi-bituminous coal region. In the mid 20th century a new, light brick hospital building was built. The new facility had fully equipped operating rooms, deliver rooms, laboratory, X-ray and deep therapy department, administrative offices, kitchen and dietetic services. Although its capacity was only 90 beds, it had taken care of a larger number of patients than that at one time. The hospital was closed September 19, 1972, most of the newer buildings are still in existence today (2008). The main ""Clinic"" building is now used for adminstrative ofices of the Laurel Health System.

Pennsylvania,Coaldale State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Coaldale_State_Hospital,,1910,,Active,Single Building,,*Coaldale Hospital | St Luke's Miners Memorial Hospital,"NOTE: Coaldale State Hospital was one of many hospitals that Pennsylvania established for coal miners, these hospitals were also referred to as State General Hospitals, this hospital was not a psychiatric facility.
When mining started in the Panther Valley, injured miners were taken to local doctor's office. If he was hurt extremely bad, the injured was hauled to the miners home, deposited there and left to the miners wife to make him as comfortable as possible during those last hours of his life. An interesting thing is that they used the ""Black Maria,"" wagon to deliver both the injured as well as the dead miners to their homes. When people saw the ""Black Maria,"" coming up their street, they thought the worst. During the later years of mining in the Panther Valley, badly injured miners where taken by horse and wagon all the way up to Ashland State Hospital. The roads were in terrible shape, and if the injured miner was hurt seriously, the ride there usually did him in.
During early 1900, streetcars were utilized to haul the injured to Ashland or Pottsville. The ride was much smoother but it still took too much time to reach their destination. Because of this distance from Ashland or Pottsville hospitals, the Coaldale Hospital came into being. In 1909, the miners of the valley volunteered a full days pay for the construction of a hospital while the Lehigh Navigation and Coal Company through the efforts of the Superintendent Ludlow, donated a site for the building. The Coal Company also told the miners that every dollar they donated; the company would also match that amount. The location of the hospital was east of the village of Seek. The hospital would overlook the valley and was built in a very pristine area. This area was where John Moser had built his first home, which was the very first home in the area, which became known as Coaldale. The building was completed on July 11, 1910. The contributions amounted to $50,000. The structure was a three-story brick building and was originally built to accommodate 30 patients. The hospital soon averaged 68 patients. The hospital was divided into three wards; two for men and one for women. Because of the congestion, every available room was utilized at all times. Later, they enclosed the two large porches on the south side which gave the hospital eight additional beds.
In 1911, the interior of the hospital was destroyed by fire. All patients were taken to nearby houses to be treated. Luckily, the homes were empty at the time. Throughout the years, the hospital has been in continuous operation. In 1934 the majority of the patients were miners of the valley, and that there were more surgical cases presented than medical cases. In the men's ward at one point of time, there were a large number of broken limbs, nine of which were suspended from slings, swung from overhead. There were also a large number of burned patients. One was a survivor of the Foster tunnel entombment. At the time he was in the hospital suffering from burns sustained in the mine explosion. The laundry, laboratory, and dispensary are located in the basement. The dispensary, which is quite small for the work being done, has about 80 patients per day. A modern X-ray machine, classed as one of the best for those early years, a modern kitchen with all the latest equipment and complete refrigerating plant were all added. The first nurses in the hospital were; Miss V. Kazakewica and Miss Nellie Close. The first patient admitted to the hospital was Stephen Snikschak from Lansford who was admitted on July 14, 1910. In time new wards were added for burn victims, women and children, including an isolation ward and corridors. Being that the original capacity of the hospital was 30 beds, there wasn't enough beds for new patients so 10 more beds and six cots were crowded in, allowing scarcely enough room between each bed for a nurse to attend the patients.
When possible the overflow was taken care of by placing two patients in one bed, and other are asked to sleep on the floor with blankets. To eliminate this problem, the Board of Trustees limited the class of patients admitted. Because of this some patients had to go 25 or more miles away to other hospitals. In time the board had to recall this order. Dates of new buildings are the following; the original building was built in 1909, the new annex, in Sept. 1927, and the nurses' home in 1933. The employees originally numbered 15 and in 1934 numbered 59. The bed capacity was originally 30, and in 1934 was 92. John Prostovich of Poland, was the first man to die in the hospital. The opening of the new maternity department was in January, 1932. The first child born there was Daniel Conahan of Seek, born on January 1, 1932. In 1927 ground was broken for the Nurses Home. For some reason work on the building ceased in 1929 when it was almost completed. Probably because of the Great Depression, things like this were curtailed. This building stood vacant until 1933, when the Board of Directors managed to cut all the necessary red tape with the State Department, and then preparations were made for its occupancy. [1]
The hospital closed as a state general hospital in 1992 but is currently active in private hands, now being called St Luke's Miners Memorial Hospital, operating in the St Luke's hospital system.

In 1891, Hazleton General Hospital was founded to provide medical care to the coal miners of this region. Since that time, health care in the United States and here in Hazleton has changed dramatically. For many years, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania owned our hospital.
In September 1986, Hazleton General Hospital divested from the State and became a not-for-profit community hospital. Then in October 1996, Hazleton General Hospital joined together with Hazleton-Saint? Joseph Medical Center to form the Greater Hazleton Health Alliance. The Greater Hazleton Health Alliance (GHHA) was formed to bring the people of Greater Hazleton the highest quality healthcare and the latest available technology, without duplicating services, equipment and costs.
Eight years later, in 2004, an effort was begun to consolidate and relocate many services to Hazleton General Hospital. The cost of providing healthcare - which had been rising steadily across the country -had also affected our local hospitals and duplication of services at both facilities was no longer feasible.
Work began on consolidating inpatient and emergency services to Hazleton General Hospital, while outpatient services were moved to the Hazleton-Saint? Joseph campus which had surrendered its acute care hospital license in September 2005 and operated as a service of Hazleton General Hospital until the two organizations merged in December 2006.
With the realigning of services to Hazleton General Hospital came the physical changes necessary to restructure the building to become Hazleton’s premiere health care facility. An $18 million construction and renovation project began in 2005 and was completed in November 2006. As part of the project, a two-story Annex building was constructed at the back of the hospital to house a new, state-of-the-art laboratory, medical records department, medical library, physician staff office and lounge, quality management and administrative offices. Inside the hospital, a Step-Down? Unit was constructed to serve patients who were transitioning from the Intensive Care Unit.
The Emergency Department doubled in size to better accommodate the growing community population in one central location. And, incorporating the services of Lehigh Valley Hospital in a partnership to provide physician staffing to the new Emergency Department means GHHA now has access to specialists and technologies only found at larger medical facilities. A new Surgical Suite and Short Procedure Unit rounded out major medical service renovations and expansions within the hospital.
In the fall 2005, ground was broken for the construction of the 72,000 sq. ft. Hazleton Health & Wellness Center. Located on Airport Road across from WalMart?, this premier facility offers outpatient medical testing and rehabilitation services all at one convenient location. An ambulatory surgery center, physician offices and a state-of-the-art fitness center are also housed at this facility.
The Alliance serves more than 100,000 people throughout the Greater Hazleton area. Our medical staff consists of more than 100 highly-trained and well-respected physicians in a wide variety of specialties. We are well equipped and dedicated to providing our patients with emergency, diagnostic, and therapeutic medical services.
The Greater Hazleton Health Alliance, including Hazleton General Hospital, is now poised to move forward with high quality health care in the Greater Hazleton area to better serve our community now and well into the future.[1]

In 1905, a typhoid outbreak determined the city's need for a local hospital. The hospital was dedicated on Oct. 12, 1909, on land donated by Susquehanna Coal Co. and funds raised by the community. The original hospital was used to meet the needs of local miners. In 1911, the hospital was taken over by the state and renamed Nanticoke State Hospital. In 1914, under the direction of Director of Nursing Margaret Leech, the school of nursing at the State Hospital of Nanticoke was established. Eventually, the original building was demolished and Mercy Special Care Hospital of Nanticoke was built in 1990's. A subsidiary of Community Health Systems called Post Acute Medical took over and closed in 2014. The building remains empty after an anonymous bidder bought the building for $100,000 in 2015.

Founded as a state hospital for miners, the original hospital building was demolished sometime in the early 20th century. The current brick building was built in the 1930s. Over the years the building was added onto several times. As of 2011 the hospital covers about 20,000 square feet on nearly 15 acres in Philipsburg Pennsylvania. It includes 14 buildings and other structures, the oldest of which dates to 1922. The state ran the hospital until 1991 when it was closed.
A community group was able to reopen the hospital after the state closed it, they renamed it Philipsburg Area Hospital. The hospital was closed again in 2006[1] when administrators filed for bankruptcy and could not fulfill the agreements of the bankruptcy. After the second closure an area doctor named Larry Adams tried to reopen the hospital for a third time but was arrested on June 12, 2007 on drug charges.[2] Ownership of the hospital reverted back to the state which put the hospital up for sale in 2010 for $500,000. When no bidders came forward, the state cut the price to $225,000 and again put the property up for sale, setting a deadline of June 30, 2010 for potential buyers to come forward.[3][4]
As of July 2011 the hospital still awaits a buyer. Hazardous materials contained in the buildings and around the property hinder the sale process as well as escalate the cost to demolish the buildings. The state currently has no plans to do anything with the property if it isn't purchased.[5]
The hospital was demolished in 2014,[6] and the property was sold in 2016.[7]

Located at the corner of Jenks and Park Avenues in Punxsutawney. The Adrian Hospital was founded by Adrian Iselin of New York who gave $5,000 for the purpose. The first hospital building was erected at the Adrian Mines (in Delancey) by the Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company in 1889. Originally intended to serve the men working in the mines, it soon became a general hospital serving not only the people of Adrian (Delancey) but the people of Punxsutawney as well. Due to its popularity, that building soon became inadequate.
It was decided to move the facility into Punxsutawney. The building was completed in 1898. New Yorker Adrian Iselin’s initial $5000 endowment was augmented with $100,000 in commonwealth funds, leading to a new “State Hospital” designation. Interestingly, in 1902 it cost $5 per week to stay in a hospital ward. A private room cost between $10 to $25 per week. Also of interest, the year 1901 saw the annual expenditure for medical supplies at $234.09 and salaries for nurses totaled $3,160.53. It isn't clear how many nurses were on staff that divided this sum. This building housed the hospital until 1975 when a new building was completed north of town on Route 36. The old structure was remodeled and is now occupied by Wellington Heights which is a personal care facility.

Pennsylvania,Shamokin State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Shamokin_State_Hospital,,1912,,Active,Single Building,,,"NOTE: Shamokin State Hospital was one of many hospitals that Pennsylvania established for coal miners, these hospitals were also referred to as State General Hospitals, this hospital was not a psychiatric facility.
Founded in 1912 by the state of Pennsylvania to provide health care to coalminers and their families, SACH divested from the state in 1992
It is governed by a volunteer board of directors and parented by the Lower Anthracite Health Corporation. SACH remains committed to providing residents with the best possible health care in a cost-effective manner.
In recent years, the SACH Board and management have taken major strides forward to earn the community’s confidence and trust.
SACH is currently in its last year of its capital campaign, Vision 2005. The largest construction project undertaken by the hospital to date, Phase I of the campaign, a 33,000-square-foot addition was constructed to expand and support surgical, laboratory and central supply services. The lower level and first floor were officially dedicated and opened in November 2003.
Phase II of the project completed in March 2004, and the new medical/surgical care unit opened on the Wing’s second floor.
SACH opened a state-of-the-art, spacious and centrally located intensive/cardiac care unit (ICU) in late 2004 as part of Phase III of the Vision campaign.
Phase IV, currently in progress, is anticipated for completion by the end of 2005. It will include renovations of the diagnostic imaging services department, and the installation of the new Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS). Also, a new easily accessible main entrance was designed, and is under construction for the front of the hospital while the information technology department is scheduled to move in order to gain needed physical space for a training room and equipment storage.[1] The orginal 1912 structure has been torn down and replaced with a modern hospital complex which serves the community to this day.

Pennsylvania,Valley Forge General Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Valley_Forge_General_Hospital,1942,1942,1943,Preserved,Corridor Plan,,Valley Forge Army Hospital | University of Valley Forge (current),"The story of the Valley Forge Army Hospital begins on April 1, 1942, when a directive from the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC authorized construction of this general hospital on its present site. On May 26, 1942, actual work was begun. Colonel Henry Beeuwkes, Medical Corps, reported as the first Commanding Officer in June 1942. He established his headquarters in the farmhouse located on the post property. This farm house was ultimately to become building #100, and the residence of the Hospital Commanding Officer. The hospital was situated on a 180-acre site that contained 130 two-story semi-permanent brick buildings, according to the Army Medical Corps. All the medical buildings were connected with a total of 7 miles of corridors.
On George Washington’s birthday, the 22nd of February 1943, and with ceremonial simplicity, the Valley Forge General Hospital was opened. Nearly a year later, on September 26th the Army post was formally dedicated. In contrast to its quiet beginnings, this later occasion was marked by distinguished quests and a full military dress parade, fitting symbols of the transition in this medical base from infancy to full maturity. Listed among the guests were Major General George F. Lull, Deputy Surgeon General, U.S. Army, Justice Owen J. Roberts, Associate Justice, US Supreme Court, and Brigadier General Milton G. Baker, Commander Pennsylvania State Guard, and former Commandant of Valley Forge Military Academy.
The Department of Psychiatry and Neurology was among the world leaders in Psychiatric treatments. Many new medications were first utilized there, and many treatment techniques were developed there. The physicians, nurses and the neuropsychiatric technicians sent tens of thousands of cured personnel back to duty. The return to duty rate following treatment was much higher than in the vast majority of civilian hospitals.
In 1950, the Department of Defense ordered the closing of the hospital in a cost-cutting move, but local protests and the Korean War ended the plan. The hospital continued to treat soldiers until 1974. In June of that year, the hospital closed and its facilities handed over to a number of groups. The site is now occupied by the University of Valley Forge.",1975,"Phoenixville, PA",,

Pennsylvania,Brooke Glen Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brooke_Glen_Hospital,,1974,1966,Active,Modern Plan,,,"Brooke Glen Hospital, formerly the Northwestern Institute of Psychiatry, is an active psychiatric hospital located in Fort Washington, PA, not far from the city of Philadelphia. In its fifty year existence it became regionally notorious because of the growing number of patient abuse scandal, starting in the early 1990's. The site has also been frequently sued by Germantown Academy, which sits across the street from the hospital, as a number of escaped patients flee to the grade school to hide.
Founded in 1966, the Northwestern Institute, is a fully licensed and accredited 146 bed private psychiatric facility. 'The Institute' was never affiliated with the more renown Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, which was formerly located only a few miles away in West Philadelphia. The name was formally changed in 2004 as a move in improving the facility's public image, following a number of lawsuits regarding patient abuse, neglect, fraud and the sexual employment of a number of patients. It is currently owned by medical conglomerate United Healthcare Services (UHS), along with: Friends Hospital and Horsham Clinic.

It was founded by Dr. R.A. Given, and opened in the spring of 1860. The hospital continued to operate as a psychiatric hospital until 1969, when the changing atmosphere of mental healthcare caused it to close. When it was originally opened in the late 19th century, it was 8.5 miles from the limits of the City of Philadelphia, and located near the Oaklane station of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroads.
Dr. Robert A. Given, an Irish immigrant and formally an assistant physician at the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, erected buildings near the village of Clifton in the summer of 1859. There he established a private hospital for wealthy patients afflicted with, what was then known as, 'nervous and mental diseases'. It was designed and licensed by the commonwealth to accommodate forty patients, twenty male and twenty female. The main building was originally constructed of stone, three stories high with a basement. Shortly after construction a mansard roof was added giving the building a fourth floor in which the amusement hall was located. Each department contained four wards: a parlor, a hallway 60' long and 8' wide, and a bath room. Though both sexes were originally housed in the same building, many improvements were made from time to time in different halls, rendering the hospital's accommodations more attractive.
In the women's department, an annex building measuring 30'x 50' was erected in 1885, which was it necessary because of the enlargement of the patient rooms in the main building. The hospital's grounds were originally 25-acres, but by 1885 they had been expanded to 43-acres. The 25-acres dedicated to patient recreation were handsomely laid out and planted with a variety of ornamental trees, evergreen and deciduous. A farm of thirty two acres, partially heavily wooded, was also found on site. The wooded grounds, besides for ensuring the patients perfect privacy, affording them to take leisure walks, crossing the pleasing variety of hills and valleys, meadows, brooks and woodland. No efforts were spared to render the hospital building fire proof. Fire escapes were attached to both wings of the facility; and in addition, arrangements exist on each floor to enable the occupants to pass readily from side-to-side without the use of the stairs. The building throughout was thoroughly heated with steam and lighted by gas.
After running the hospital for thirty years, Dr. Given died on January 10, 1888. Following his death, Dr. Given's former assistant physician, Dr. J. Willoughby Philips, was appointed as chief psychiatrist. The hospital continued to operate for the next century, albeit with a dropping census, until the summer of 1968 when it was forced to shut its doors, citing financial stressors. The current site of the property is a local indoor bazaar and a Pizza Hut.
For much of the 19th century the facility maintained close ties to Pennsylvania Hospital and the University of Pennsylvania.
""This institutional although not within in the city limits, is so near them as to be properly mentioned in connection with the objects of this work. It is a private Hospital for mental disease, and derives it support from the payments made for board and medical care of patients.
No patient is received for a less period than three months. A certificate of insanity, signed by two physicians, and acknowledged before a magistrate, is invariably required.
A lady, well educated and of unexceptionable manners and deportment, resides in the same apartments, and devotes her time to lady patients, thus securing them on all occasions a pleasant companion and a watchful friend.

It is a private behavioral health hospital that has been in continuous operation since 1851, with its current facility being built in 1933. The complex, as it originally stood, occupied a square of ground. This building, whose doors are open to patients of 'all creeds and nationalities, has a capacity of three hundred beds'. It was purposed by its founders to be a medical facility; however, when it became appropriated by Temple University it was resigned primarily to the function of inpatient psychiatric care; The facility also has an Emergency Department and inpatient medical floor  for patient care. The facility also houses one of Philadelphia's Crisis Response Centers, which is an assessment center for emergency psychiatric issues, allowing patients to be placed for either psychiatric or substance abuse issues.
The original Episcopal Hospital's charter was put forth by the Protestant Episcopal Church of America, in the Diocese of Philadelphia following a lengthy meeting of laity and clergy. It was elected that a facility to treat the poor and ill of the city should be constructed in Philadelphia's northern quarter. The grounds, consisting of a square (six acres), for the original hospital were donated by the daughters of John Leamy, a local wealthy business mogul, and episcopal parishoner.
The current Episcopal Hospital holds a 118 inpatient beds, 74 for acute care and 44 for extended acute, as well a large outpatient clinic.

It is the United States' first private psychiatric hospital employed exclusively for the treatment of the mentally ill. It has been continuously operating since it first opened its doors, albeit in different buildings. Friends Hospital continues to enjoy a reputation as an excellent inpatient facility, and maintains renown in the national and international psychiatric community for the quality of care received, as well as various academic lectures held on site. In 2000, US News and World Report ranked Friends Hospital as one of the nation's top psychiatric hospitals, and in 2002 six of Friends Hospitals psychiatrists were named as being the region's ""Top Doc's"" by Philadelphia Magazine.
In the yearly meeting of the Society of Friends (Quakers) in Philadelphia in 1811, they mandated that a facility should be purchased and maintained for those members who had lost their sensibilities and proper judgment. Much like the Quaker York Retreat, asylum was sought in a country atmosphere. The location that was selected was, at the time, ten miles outside of the city of Philadelphia, and offered a peaceful rural refuge for those afflicted. The Quakers officially established their asylum in 1813, drawing on a belief that all persons could ""moral, ordered existence if treated with kindness, dignity, and respect"", despite disabilities. The influential Quaker minister, Thomas Scattergood, decried what he considered the harsh conditions faced by patients in mental asylums; Scattergood instead called for the ""moral treatment"" of patients, which was also advocated by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a physician at Pennsylvania Hospital. This model served as an inspiration for the establishment of the Friends Asylum for Persons Deprived of the Use of Their Reason.
The design and oversight of this project was undertaken by seven primary members: Thomas Scattergood, Emmor Kimber, Jonathan Evans, Thomas Wistar, Ellis Yarnall, Samuel Griffitts and Isaac Bonsall. These original members composed the original mission statement and charter of the asylum; and further divided their clinical intention into six primary points. In their own words they are as follows:
A 52-acre farm located in Frankford was allocated by the Society of Friends for the new asylum. $6,764 was paid for this lot, which was deemed an exceedingly large amount of money to be paid by a number of members of the committee. Six additional acres were added to this site shortly thereafter. Delegates were also selected from the committee to consult with the Quaker York Retreat in England, which was only founded two decades prior. The Friends Asylum opened its doors on May 15, 1817, and within the month had accepted two patients, of different sexes, for inpatient care. During the first year of operations nineteen patients were received, many of whom were deemed cured, and returned to their  day-to-day life in Philadelphia.
To provide for the suitable accommodation of persons who are or may be deprived of the use of their reason and the maintenance of an asylum for their reception, which is intended to furnish, besides requisite medical aid, such tender, sympathetic attention as may soothe their agitated minds, and under the Divine Blessing, facilitate their recovery.
The original building, now known as the 'Scattergood Building' was designed to be North facing, and 322 feet high with a stone edifice. It was placed at considerable distance from the public road, which is now Roosevelt Blvd., some five hundred feet. Two wings, 100 feet long, flanking the front of the structure were completed on both sides. However, unlike Kirkbride's plans, they were not intended to discriminate between a clinical population. This building was made fellow to a small adjoining library, as well as a hospital garden, which was perceived as being crucial to the treatment of the insane in the 19th century.
The asylum was originally purposed for the care and treatment for members of the Society of Friends exclusively. However, with a change in Pennsylvania law, the Board of Managers put it to a vote and elected to remove the sectarian restrictions in 1834. Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride, the father of American Psychiatry is record as having done his medical residency at Friends Asylum, before going on to found the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital in 1841.
As with many asylums, a superintendent's house was constructed on the campus in 1859, for the easy access of medical staff. Likewise, the steward's house was built nearby in 1910. These buildings, Lawnside and Greystone, were operational until recently, until they were re-purposed by the administration of Friends Hospital.
In 1871, extensive changes were made to the Scattergood building . $20,000 were secured from the Society of Friends for this reason. In this renovation a small bronze plaque was placed along the side of the building to commemorate its history. That plaque is still in place and recounts the founding of the hospital and its prominent Quaker origins. Additionally in this renovation, a mansard roof was placed over the top of the building, as well as a two story extension to the center of the building to accommodate more patients. Admissions to the hospital were temporarily suspended during construction. Another renovation and expansion took place in 1879, where the rear center of the building was fitted for a kitchen. The old kitchen was turned into a storage room and a bakery was constructed in the women's ward. By 1880 the Friends Asylum was able to hold 80 patients at one time.
Friends Hospital presented a number of innovations in the field. The staff introduced the use of pets for therapeutic recreation in 1830; and in 1889, Dr. Anna Elizabeth Broomall (1847-1931) was appointed at the hospital's first female physician. She was a close associate of Dr. Alice Bennett, the Superintendent of Norristown State Hospital's Women's Department. Like many asylums of the period, Friends opened a nursing school in 1894 for the education and certification of students who wished to learn the trade of psychiatric nursing. The first such graduating class was in 1896, of which two were men and four were women. The nursing school was exclusively advocated by Dr. Broomall, which was paralleled by a similar state program at Norristown.
Friends Hospital continued to expand through the early 20th century. In 1905, the Scattergood building was again expanded to accommodate more beds on the male ward. Additionally, reading rooms were constructed on both floor for the recreation of both sexes. This was followed by a modernization of the hospital's culinary department in 1906, as refrigeration and ice units were installed to meet the growing needs of the hospital. Five years latter, the asylum expanded its local property to a total of 100-acres. Friends Asylum also opened a satellite campus after 326 additional acres were aquired in Trevose, PA.
In 1922, the Hygeia Building was completed, which was originally designed to be used for hydrotherapy. It also housed a small natural science museum, as well as nurses' quarters. The hospital continued to expand with the construction of the Bonsall and Tuke Buildings in 1970, bringing the hospital to it's current capacity of 192-beds. The American Psychological Association further honored Friends Hospital by officially declaring it a training site in 1979. The Greystone program, a crisis residential (CRP) was established the year following for the treatment of low-acuity cases.
A leader in behavioral health care, Friends offers a system of comprehensive programs and services to people suffering from behavioral and emotional health problems. With 192 beds, Friends is the Delaware Valley's largest provider of inpatient behavioral health services, providing individualized programs for adolescents, adults, older adults and eating disorders. We have specialized programs for Women's Issues and Dual Diagnosis (mental health/substance abuse). Friends Hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Friends Hospital is currently owned by: United Healthcare Services, which also locally operated: Brooke Glen Hospital and the Horsham Clinic. Friends Hospital is contracted through the County of Philadelphia, as well as Community Behavioral Health, to accept 302 commitment petitions.
The many surviving historic buildings at Friends Hospital are sited on a large campus located off Roosevelt Boulevard just below Oxford Circle. Despite the growth of the city of Philadelphia, the campus represents a rural oasis in otherwise urban Northeast Philadelphia. Extensive historical landscaping, including renowned azalea gardens (open to the public), are also included in the ""National Historic Landmark"" designation of Friends Hospital.
Located on the grounds of the Friends Hospital, the Greystone Program is a long-term community residence designed to meet the special needs for individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses. Consisting of two houses, Greystone House and Hillside House, the program is dedicated to helping its residents move toward recovery, greater independence, and an enhanced quality of life. The Greystone Program emphasizes the development of skills of daily living, socialization, purposeful activity, and recovery enables residents to realize their dignity, worth and highest individual potential. Many residents have chosen to make the Greystone Program their permanent home while other will successfully transition to a less structured environment.

The building and part of the former campus is currently being leased to Blackwell Human Services and the Kirkbride Center, and remains functional within the human services field; however, it is still owned by the University of Pennsylvania Health System. It was expanded in 1959 to accommodate a changing inpatient population, at which time half the original campus was lost, and the more modern ""North Building"" was constructed. However, because of changing perception of the practice of psychiatry, and insurance protocol, the facility was forced to close its doors permanently. In 2004, the NHPRC was issued a grant to organize, preserve and make publicly accessible the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital's archival collection.
There is a tremendous amount of confusion about the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. This is because there were in fact two separate facilities bearing the name. The first, founded in 1751 by Dr. Thomas Bond and Benjamin Franklin was located on Eighth and Pine Streets, and was completed in 1755. This facility is still operational, albeit not for its original purpose. The original structure of Pennsylvnia Hospital is now largely is maintained because of its historic value to the city and state (the modern Pennsylvania Hospital sits behind this building). This original facility found itself overwhelmed by the number of 'lunatic' patients, and regularly had their insane wards overcapacity. The Board of Managers voted to build a second hospital, in what was then rural West Philadelphia, as was the style of such institutions at the time. This second hospital was known as the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, as to draw distinction from their primary facility. This was also the hospital that Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride was Superintendent, who is regarded as one of the fathers of American Psychiatry. Both facilities were run under the same Board of Mangers during their tenure, but only one had a specific specialization in behavioral healthcare.
From its inception, Pennsylvania Hospital admitted both the physically ill and the mentally ill to their historic South Philadelphia campus. Eighteenth and early nineteenth century medical practice was crude, and frequently counter-productive by modern day standards, but the treatment of the mentally ill was particularly harsh. Solitary confinement, bloodletting and involuntary restraints were the order of the day by most physicians. Over time, the proportion of the hospital’s patients who were severely mentally ill increased in size, until it began to become overcrowded, leaving little room for the physically ill.  In response, the Board of Managers believed itself obligated to limit the admission of the mentally ill.  The west wing of the hospital had been designed and set aside for the mentally ill, but by 1817 it was filled near to capacity and additional space had been set aside for mentally ill patients elsewhere in the facility.
In a published report by the Board of Manager in 1817, the number are brought into focus.  Two-thirds of the Hospital’s patients were the mentally ill and the Board of Managers had previously set aside two-thirds of the Hospital’s rooms for their care.  The west wing was entirely committed to the care of the mentally ill, and sixteen of the thirty-nine rooms available in the east wing were also devoted to the mentally ill.  Though the completed Hospital building was just twelve years old, the Board of Managers had already adopted a policy which limited the number of mentally ill patients for this very reason.  There may have been calls for the expansion of the physical site from other administrators, but the Board was unwilling to consider the Hospital’s vacant land for the construction of yet another new buildings. The U.S. census returns for the first decades of the 19th century show increasing pressure: the number of resident staff and patients at the Hospital increased significantly in each decade. The 1820's, in particular, experienced an increase in the average number of resident patients, from less than 150 to more than 200 present at any one time. By 1830 the average daily number of mentally ill patients was somewhere around 115.    The demand for the services of the Pennsylvania Hospital must have been near, if not beyond the Hospital’s ability to provide them.
In 1829, Philadelphia Almshouse announced that intended to shut down their center city facility by the fall of 1834, with the intention of transferring all of their services to a new site in the West Philadelphia neighborhood of Blockley. Pennsylvania Hospital’s initial response to the move of the Philadelphia Almshouse was to attempt to purchase its center city land holdings. The ""Western Lot"" of the Pennsylvania Hospital was open land on the west side of Ninth Street. The Hospital owned the land from Spruce Street on the north all the way south to Pine Street, but only half the distance to Tenth Street. The other half of the block was also open and it was owned by the Almshouse. On the other side of Tenth Street was the city square on which the Almshouse buildings stood. If the western half of the Ninth Street block could be purchased, the way would be clear to expand westward yet another city square.
On May 3, 1830, the Contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital met and adopted a resolution directing the Board of Managers of the Hospital to purchase the western half of the Ninth Street block from the Almshouse, but not to offer more than $50,000 for the land available. The Board quickly made an offer of the full $50,000, but the Guardians of the Poor refused to sell. Instead, later that same year, they decided to put the land up for sale at public auction. The Board of Managers, meeting on December 27, pf the same year, authorized a bid of $50,000 at the auction, but the minutes of the Board for January 12, 1831 note that the Board’s representatives attended the auction and bid $50,100, but that another bidder had offered more and had purchased the property outright. The winning bid was just $400 more than the hospital had offered: $50,400.75. The new owner planned to develop the site promptly. The Hospital’s Board of Managers, frustrated in their efforts to expand westward, were now forced to consider other options.  The Managers began by articulating the Hospital’s need. The minutes of the Board for January 31, 1831 included the following statement:
The Managers reflected on these minute and then, in April, decided to bring it before the next meeting of the Contributors, which was held on May 2, 1831.  The Contributors responded by adopting the following resolutions:
These resolutions confronted the Managers with two major challenges for the future of the hospital: where to locate a new hospital building dedicated to the care of the insane, and how to fund its design, construction, furnishings, and subsequent operations. The Board of Managers would struggle with these two questions on and off for the next four years.  Their first choice was to build on the city square on the south side of Pine Street, bounded by Pine, Eighth, Lombard, and Ninth streets.  In November of 1831, the Managers paid $10,000 for a property on the west side of Eighth Street, between Pine and Lombard. With this purchase they consolidated the Hospital’s ownership of the entire city block. In March 1832, the Managers voted to recommend to the Board of Contributors that the Hospital sell the ""Eastern Lot,"" that is, the city block bounded by Spruce, Seventh, Pine, and Eighth streets. The Board of Managers’ recommendation, though regretted, was agreed upon as the best option available to the Hospital at the time. At their regular annual meeting, held on May 7, 1832, the Board of Contributors adopted the following resolution
The disposition of the Eastern Lot, however, proved to be a very slow process.  More than a year passed before the Board of Managers authorized the first sales of land, and several years passed before the last of the building lots were sold to private interests. In the interim a division took place among hospital administrators about how to proceed with expansion, and how to properly address the rising census of insane patients. Economics necessity had them bound to inpatient psychiatric care for the time being. This had been a mounting problem for several decades prior because of the reversal of hospital policy under Dr. Benjamin Rush, stating that lunatic should be treated on the regular medical unit of the hospital.
At a meeting of the Board held on January 27, 1834, progress was reported for possible construction on the south lot of the property; but just a month later, on February 24th, the committee overseeing this capital improvement was dissolved. The minutes of the Board of Managers contain no further reference to plans for a new building on the South Lot of the hospital. It is likely that the proposal must have met too much resistance from administration. Another year passed without any change to the status development of this project. The Sale of building lots, carved out of the former Eastern Lot progressed, but only very slowly. Finally, on May 8, 1835, the Board of Managers decided to call a meeting of the Contributors. The Contributors concluded by adopting the following resolution:
The Managers appointed an 'ad hoc' committee to respond to these resolutions and to report to the Board.  On August 4, 1835 the committee reported back to the Board. The members of the committee reported their preference for a new hospital for the insane inside the city limits, but because popular sway among the members of the board lead to adopting a resolution to locate the new hospital in a more rural atmosphere. The long debate over the location of a new hospital seemed finally concluded, but the issue of funding was still outstanding. The committee estimated that the cost of land, design, construction, and furnishings for a new hospital for the insane would be $203,000; that the annual operating expenses of the hospital would be around $25,000 per anum; and that the annual revenues from paying patients would be about $12,500. The interest on $200,000 in capital funds would be required to pay the remaining annual cost of $12,500.  The total estimated for construction would be $403,000, a sum the committee termed ""immense."" (roughly equivalent to 40 million USD in 2013).
The hospital moved to purchase a 101-acre farm in West Philadelphia in 1835 from Matthew Arrison, a local merchant. In March of 1836 the Board of Managers selected an English architect, Isaac Holden, to design the new buildings. The cornerstone for this new facility was laid on July 26, 1836 on the corner of 44th and Market Streets, which would later become the Female Department of the hospital. The design of the new Hospital for the Insane followed certain fundamental decisions. First, the Board and its architect maintained the Haverford Avenue orientation of the country estate.  The entrance to the new hospital buildings remained on Haverford Avenue and the brick mansion at the top of the hill was not disturbed, as it would soon become the house of the hospital superintendent.  The new structures were sited behind the big house and towards the southeast end of the 101 acres.  Second, in order ""to have control of all the springs in the neighborhood of the pump-house,"" the Board made two purchases of land, which together added approximately ten acres to the east end of the grounds. Third, they enclosed forty-one acres of the land, including the two new purchases, by building a large stone wall, 5,483 feet in length and 10½ feet high around the hospital's primary enclosure. In 1839, when the construction was only about half finished, Holden took ill and returned to England. Construction was completed from his original designs.
The question of selecting an appropriate superintendent was complicated because of the absence of other large psychiatric facilities in the America at the time. Locally, only Friends Hospital, then known at the Frankford Asylum, was operational in treating psychiatric disorders, and was only financially viable because of large donations offered from the Society of Friends. The Board of Manager voted on October 12, 1840 and elected to hire the thirty-one year old Alienist physician, Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride, as the head of the new hospital, which would open the following January. Dr. Kirkbride was Pennsylvania native, born in Morrisville, where his family resided, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School only a few years prior in 1832. Kirkbride  had served three years as a resident physician at Friends Hospital for the Insane in Frankford township, a rural setting about five miles northeast of the City of Philadelphia.  In 1835 he returned to Philadelphia and opened a general practice. Just before his appointment in 1839, he married the daughter of one of the former Managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital. He accepted the Board’s appointment and immediately took control of the new department.
In January 1841, the Board of Managers opened the new hospital buildings and gradually, over the next few months, transferred ninety-three insane patients to the West Philadelphia campus. A Philadelphia newspaper, the North American, reported on the progress of the move in its issue of March 1, 1841:
Another Philadelphia newspaper, the Public Ledger, on 29 May, also reported on the new hospital:108
At the regular, annual meeting of the Contributors to Pennsylvania Hospital, held on May 3, 1841, the Board of Managers reported that the main new building of the 'Hospital for the Insane' was officially completed and occupied. They also provided the Contributors with a final accounting of the project’s ongoing venues and expenditures. The purchase of the 101-acre Arrison farm estate, as well as two subsequent purchases of adjoining land, totaling ten acres had together cost $33,058.81. Design and construction had cost $265,000. Total expenditures to date were therefore $298,058.81, significantly under the previous expectations. This sum was more than balanced by the proceeds from the sale of the city square to the east of the Eighth Street, $154,226.24; by the proceeds from the sale of the partial squares to the west of Ninth Street, $120,000.00; and by the accumulated interest on the sale of these lands, $48,883.08. Total revenues to date were therefore $323,109.32, leaving $25,050.51 in the hospital building fund.
The new superintendent, Thomas Story Kirkbride, gained national renown because of his particular clinical methods. He developed a more humane way of treatment for the mentally ill that became widely influential within American Psychiatry. Today, the former Institute campus exists as a multi-purpose social-service facility. The new hospital, located on a 101-acre (0.41 km²) tract of the as yet unincorporated district of West Philadelphia, offered comforts and a “humane treatment” philosophy that set a standard for its day. Unlike other asylums where patients were often kept chained in crowded, unsanitary wards with little if any treatment, patients at Pennsylvania Hospital resided in private rooms, received medical treatment, worked outdoors and enjoyed recreational activities including lectures and a use of the hospital library. The campus originally featured one, but later, two hospital buildings, which were separated by a creek and pleasure grounds.
The first building was a long thin building located west of the Schuylkill River. This building would eventually become the female department. Though the building does reflect the Kirkbride Plan it was actually constructed before Dr. Kirkbride was given full supervisory duties. Construction began under the control of architect Isaac Holden, but later illness forced Issac to return to his home country of England. The building was then finished by a young Samuel Sloan, who had previously worked as a carpenter on Eastern State Penitentiary. Sloan finished the building in 1841 using Holden's plans. The building was a rather simple design compared to later Kirkbride Plan buildings. Constructed of cut limestone, it was three stories tall with a central administration section flanked on either side by a set of wings. The top of the administration section was crowned with a large dome. On both the front and back of the administration section were stone porticoes. The interior of the building was well furnished, the lavishly carpeted corridors were twelve feet wide. The building features iron stairs, well lighted wards, and iron water tanks in the dome over the administration section, which provided fresh water to all of the building.
While the main building of the new Hospital was completed, Superintendent Kirkbride petitioned the Managers that it was not adequate for ""the noisy, violent and habitually filthy patients."" He requested the Managers and Contributors to approve the construction of two detached buildings for this particular class of patients. The Contributors, at their May 1841 meeting, did approve the construction of these additional structures. These ward building were much smaller, one story, ""W"" shaped buildings. They were frequently used to house the noisy, disruptive and violent patients, so that they wouldn't disturb the calmer, more manageable patients in the main hospital building.
Superintendent Kirkbride developed his treatment philosophy based on research he conducted at other progressive asylums of the day including the asylum at Worcester, Massachusetts. Out of his philosophy emerged what would become known as the Kirkbride Plan, which created a model design for psychiatric hospital that was employed across the United States throughout the 19th century. This plan would be used for the hospital’s second building. On July 7, 1856, the cornerstone for a new building, built with the money from individual contributions, was laid at 49th and Market Streets, five blocks west of the original building. The new structure, which was to house only male patients, was dubbed the Department for Males, while the original building officially became known as the Department for Females. Dr Kirkbride commissioned Architect Samuel Sloan to design the new building. Built of stone and brick, the new building was laid out, as Kirkbride expressed, ""in echelons."" A large rectangular building, 3 1/2 stories tall, with gable roof and central dome, and a 2 story pedimented portico on its western facade, provided the central focus of the hospital and also housed its administrative offices. Extending from the center of this building to the north and south are two symmetrical wings about 250 feet long, 3 stories tall with gable roofs and ventilation cupolas at their furthermost termini. These wings were in turn connected to another pair, which extended to the east approximately 230 feet, paralleling each other, and of the same general appearance. At each terminus of the these rear wings was a final E-shaped wing which extended out approximately 250 feet. The north E wing housed troublesome patients, and the south E wing has since been removed. No wings are exactly in line, thus allowing fresh air to reach each wing on all four sides. Each of the patients' rooms in the wings had its own fresh air duct, the air being driven in from the towers at the terminus of each wing. There were 16 wards in the hospital, one for each of 16 distinct classes of patients, and each ward had its own parlor, dining room, and bathroom. Outside, there were gardens, shops, and walks for the patients.
For the first seventy years of its existence Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane steadily increased in its size and clinical complexity.  As early as February 1844 the trend for expansion had been firmly established.  The Public Ledger took note of the statistics in Kirkbride’s annual report and published the following brief article: We have received a copy of the Report of the Managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane for 1843.  There were 140 patients admitted during the year, 126 have been discharged or died, and there remain 132 under care.  There were cured 68, much improved 7, improved 14, stationary 20, died 17 – total 126.  The Report contains a number of statistical tables, showing the number and sex of the persons admitted since the opening: their ages, occupations, condition, nativity, country, and the causes which produced insanity in them, with the duration and number of the attacks.  Since the opening of this Hospital, three years since, there has been a steady increase in the number of patients admitted, and the number under care at one time has constantly been augmenting.  The total number under care in 1841, was 176; in 1842, 238; in 1843, 258.
Expansion of the site continued, and by 1851, just ten years after its opening, the Hospital was ""inconveniently crowded"", though the [Annual] hospital report stated that ""the general good health which then prevailed, enabled us to receive all the cases that were brought to the Hospital, although much difficulty was often experienced in accommodating them."" Two years later, the annual report for 1853 became more grim, and stated:
By May 1854, Dr. Kirkbride had convinced the Hospital’s Board of Managers of the need to build a second, larger hospital building on the West Philadelphia grounds, and to separate the patients by sex, which was the custom of the era.  The Managers authorized a $250,000 fundraising campaign and published an ""Appeal to the Citizens of Pennsylvania for Means to Provide Additional Accommodations for the Insane.""  By the spring of 1856 the campaign had raised $209,000 in gifts and private pledges. In March of that year, the Managers authorized the design and construction of a separate building to house, the ""Department for Males"", and it appointed a building committee to oversee the work. The committee selected Samuel Sloan as its primary architect. Sloan took due consideration of Dr. Kirkbride's suggestions, as well as the guidelines of his predecessor in the Department for Females. Construction began in July, and in October the Managers conducted a ceremony in West Philadelphia in which the Mayor of Philadelphia, Richard Vaux, laid the hospital cornerstone. The new building opened three years later, in October 1859, with a separate entrance on 49th Street, midway between Haverford Avenue and the West Chester Road (renamed Market Street). The new building’s total cost was $322,542.86, but additional expenses– a boundary wall, carriage house, carpenter shop, brought the total expenditure to approximately $350,000.17.
The new 'Department for Males' was magnificent, with ""a handsome Doric portico of granite in front, and is surmounted by a dome of good proportions. The lantern on the dome is 119 feet from the pavement below, and from it is a beautiful panoramic view of the fertile and highly improved surrounding country, the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, and the city of Philadelphia, with its many prominent objects of interest."" In 1860, the original building, now the ""Department for Females,"" was extensively renovated, and placed in the same condition as the new building. The capacity of the Department for the Insane was thereby doubled, from 220 patients to 470 total.  It was now an extraordinary large institution, one of the first to be designed and organized in accordance with the 1851 guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association (guidelines which had been authored by Kirkbride himself), but it was also was one with critics.  Dr. Meigs, in his 1876 history of the Pennsylvania Hospital, acknowledged many of the problems, but defended the hospital, stating:
But such cavils against insane hospitals come only from the thoughtless.  I have always felt, and shall always feel, grateful to the Managers of this Hospital, for the fine taste they have shown in the style and architecture of these buildings.  Amongst the pious uses of money is the embellishment of cities.
Despite the critics, expensive improvements in the physical plant continued for several years. In 1868, 1873, 1880, 1888, and 1893, five new buildings were constructed for women patients and called the South Fisher Ward, the North Fisher Ward, the Mary Shields Wards, the Cottage House or Villa, and the I.V. Williamson Wards, respectively.  In 1864 the women’s ""Gymnastic Hall"" was funded and constructed and in 1890 a gymnasium was also constructed for the men's campus.  At the close of the 19th century the facilities of the hospital for the Insane rivaled those of any similar institution in the nation.
Likewise, the staffing of the 'Hospital for the Insane' steadily expanded through the 19th century and well into the early 20th. A broadly useful view of the hospital may be obtained from the decennial U.S. census returns.  In 1850, Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane housed 251 resident patients, and 85 resident staff; in 1860, 276 patients, and 119 staff; in 1870, 327 patients, and 167 staff; in 1880, 376 patients and 218 staff; in 1900, 437 patients, and 267 staff; and in 1910, 446 patients and 291 staff. A community that totaled 336 persons in 1850 more than doubled in size to one that totaled 737 in 1910. In addition to its rapid growth, it was noted for being an extremely self-contained community. There were the officers– the superintendent, the stewards, the matrons, the physicians– and those who cared directly for the patients, such as: the attendants (later called nurses); but even as early as 1850 there were also farm laborers, cooks, men to attend to the fireplaces which heated each room, carpenters, coachmen, and gate keepers, all of them resident staff, living on the grounds of the hospital proper. The number of work specializations increased with each decade, until, in 1910, there were also gardeners, waitresses, laundresses, cleaners, seamstresses, even a masseur, a pharmacist, a buyer of clothing, a bookkeeper, a storekeeper, an engineer, and two messengers.  The Department was a neighborhood unto itself.  It should also be noted that throughout this period, while the patients were almost all native born, the majority of the staff were natives of Ireland. If these arrangements seemed acceptable in the 19th century, they certainly were challenged by the changing ethnic demographics of West Philadelphia in the 20th century.
The Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane flourished under Kirkbride until his death on December 16, 1883, though for decades after his death, Philadelphia natives colloquially referred to the hospital as ""Kirkbride's."" Dr. John Chapin, the former Superintendent of the Willard State Hospital in New York, assumed the role of Superintendent of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane after Kirkbride's demise, following a lengthy election by the Board of Managers. The Board had spent ten months making their selection, which was precarious because of the fame and reputation of Kirkbride. Chapin officially assumed this role on September 1, 1884, and held that office until the resignation from his duties in 1911. He was directly succeeded by Dr. Owen Copp, who initiated a School of Nursing for Men at the Hospital. Dr. Chapin appoints Leroy Craig as the first director of 'the Pennsylvania Hospital School of Nursing for Men'. Craig gains notoriety as the first male superintendent of a male nursing school in the country. Similar schools had previously been established locally at Friends Hospital and Norristown State Hospital. The new school of nursing was devoted to training male nurses in generalized nursing practices, as well as the specialization in the disciplines of psychiatric care.
It is during the second part of the hospital's history that the particulars of its operations change dramatically. Starting in 1876 the number of patients admitted to the inpatient based upon charity began to drop, which was credited to rise of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's involvement in psychiatry as a matter of the public health. This rise in psychiatric care was found to be startling in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. When Kirkbride opened the new asylum in 1840 there were a total of 275 beds available for those who suffered from mental illnesses. shared by the facility and Friends Hospital. By 1895, 7,000 inpatient beds had been created between various: private and state hospitals, as well as local sanitariums. While this trend would continue well into the 20th century, Pennsylvania Hospital's inpatient population maximum would not change from the five-hundred beds it was allotted following its expansion in 1853. While the Institute would remain an industry leader, it was longer the only psychiatric facility available to the public regionally.
In contrast to many state facilities, the physical site and grounds of the 'Hospital for the Insane' were indeed ""of the first class"" status, and would remain so in public opinion. So too was the number of staff attending, and the staff’s general care of their patients. AS the 19th century progressed, it became clear that the 'Hospital for the Insane' was increasingly becoming an elite institution. West Philadelphia, however, was growing up all around the Hospital and between 1886 and 1891 the Managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital took four actions which demonstrated the extent of the city’s presence. The first was perhaps the most significant. In May 1886, the Contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital authorized the Managers ""to purchase such area of land, within a reasonable distance from the city, not exceeding 500 acres, in order to prepare a site for such future adjuncts or additions to their Hospital as may hereafter be required or found desirable.""  In June of that year, the Managers formed a committee which began buying land in Newtown Square, Delaware County. By May 1891, five years later, the purchases totaled ""607 acres"".  The land was designated for the future of the 'Hospital for the Insane', and in 1892 the Managers announced tentative plans for building on the acreage. However, this would never materialize.
Then, in 1888 and 1889, the Board of Managers clashed with the City of Philadelphia over their charity status and the issue of medical exemption from city taxation. In the summer of 1887, the Board of Managers authorized the construction of the ""Cottage House"" or ""Villa"" for female patients at the hospital.  The new structure opened in June 1888 to mild fan fair. The municipal government made a claim against the hospital for water supply to the new building, justifying its assessment on the argument that the rates for occupancy of the Cottage House were such as to guarantee a profit to the hospital.  The Managers sued the City and the case was appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  The Court ruled in favor of the hospital.  Morton and Woodbury, writing in 1894, trumpeted the decision:
In 1890, the entrance to the 'Department for Women' was moved from 44th Street and Haverford Avenue to the junction of Powelton Avenue, 44th Street and Market Street. A new gate and security building were constructed at the new entrance. The change was deemed necessary to ""render the Hospital more accessible to lines of travel and centres of population."" Market Street, rather than Haverford Avenue, had become the principal thoroughfare of West Philadelphia by the late 19th century. Finally, in 1891, ""the Managers made a concession of a strip of land extending from Market Street to Haverford Avenue, 80 feet wide, selling it to the City of Philadelphia, on condition that a sewer should be constructed without cost to the hospital, along the course of the former Mill Creek, to connect at both points with sewers already prepared.  This construction divides the 113 acres of the Hospital property into two nearly equal parts of upwards of fifty acres each.""  With this gift to the City of Philadelphia, the Managers allowed 46th Street to become the first thoroughfare to cut through the land of the 'Department for the Insane.' By the 1890 the immediacy of the urban area surrounding the hospital had become a major factor in its daily operations, something was was unforeseen when the first brick was laid fifty years earlier.
The original organization of Alienist physicians within Pennsylvania Hospital was severely limited. Dr. Kirkbride had laid the foundation of this level of medical hierarchy, which would be maintained to some degree until 1915. This hierarchy places the superintendent as charge and master of all medico-psychiatric issues taking place within the hospital, and an assistant physician to aid to either the male or female departments. Since this was a considerable prestigious post for many psychiatrists it became a starting point for many early careers within the field. However, shifting conceptions of psychiatric care changed in the early 20th century, largely due to legislation lobbied for by Pennsylvania's Committee on Lunacy. Additionally, the 'Food and Drug Act' of 1914 drastically altered the landscape of psychotropics within American Psychiatry. As a result, the Board of Managers of Pennsylvania Hospital, under the guidance of Dr. Owen Copp, reorganized the structure of inpatient treatment and effectively tripled the number of physicians employed to treat the insane. Attending Physicians were also allotted significantly smaller caseloads of patients, from rough 250 per doctor in 1880, to 62 in 1915. This measure also stood in stark contrast to the public mental health facilities of the period, which were notorious for being chronically understaffed.
In 1911, the Managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital appointed Owen Copp (1858-1933) Physician-in-Chief and Superintendent of the 'Hospital for the Insane'. Dr. Copp was a native of New England, who graduated from Dartmouth College in 1881, and from Harvard Medical School in 1884. One year later, he became a physician in the Tauton State Hospital for the Insane, in Massachusetts. In 1895 he was named the first Superintendent of the Massachusetts Hospital for Epileptics at Monson, and in 1899 he was named Executive Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Insanity (known today as the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health). In this last position, his achievements in improving the care of the institutionalized insane in Massachusetts brought him national attention. Pennsylvania Hospital's appointment was one of his many rewards for a long service record in psychiatry. Shortly after this appointment, he was named the American Psychiatric Association in 1921.
Dr. Copp’s administration proved trans-formative for the Hospital for the Insane. He began, as he had done in Massachusetts, by advocating higher standards in the care of the Department’s patients, in contrast to public facilities. Simultaneously, he began to reduce the duration of patient treatment and the number of in-patients present, deciding in many cases that the patient could do better in the familiar surroundings of family and community. This new philosophy was expressed in where the terms ""Insanity"" was stricken from all clinical proceedings at the hospital. Shortly thereafter, the term was deemed archaic and pejorative, and quickly fell out of clinical use by the end of the decade.
With the dawn of the 20th Century, a particular fascination with professional laboratory science was ushered in. It was posited that by more closely examining the brain and its inner workings, physicians could be able to determine the mysteries of behavioral disturbance and their alleged correlation with physio-chemical inbalances. Neurologists and Micro-biologists concluded that insanity was a 'disease' of the nervous system, and it should be treated directed as such. Researchers collected brain specimens of deceased insane patients to search for clues about the nature of such pathologies. These early neuro-psychiatrists were no longer convinced that 'humane treatment' alone was sufficient to bring about psychiatric recovery for most of the clinical population. They looked for more allegedly scientific methods in conducting their various therapies. Reflecting this changing view, the hospital's name was changed in January of 1918 from 'the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane' to the ""Department for Mental and Nervous Diseases at Pennsylvania Hospital"". This name remained with the hospital for the next four decades. It was also during this period that professional nurses and personnel trained in psychiatry replaced the former attendants.
In 1913, Dr. Edward Strecker joined the hospital as an assistant physician. Over his forty-six years of tenure at the hospital, he became a preeminent author and teacher of clinical psychiatry. In 1920, Dr. Strecker established one of the first psychiatric outpatient community clinics in the world at Pennsylvania Hospital's 8th and Spruce Street campus. This facility, which would later become Hall-Mercer Community Mental Health Center, continues to operate as a well regarding outpatient provider in the City of Philadelphia. Additionally, as a pioneer in the treatment of alcoholism, Dr. Strecker was one of the first physician to presume that alcoholism should be treated as a disease of the mind, not an ethical failing on the part of the individual. In 1935, Pennsylvania Hospital was the first psychiatric institution to hire a recovering person as an addiction counselor, a practice that has since become commonplace. Dr. Strecker, and his former alcoholic patient, Francis Chambers, Jr., developed the ""dual diagnosis therapy"" approach for recovery alcoholics, combining abstinence and ongoing psychological counseling. Following his death, the Institute's substance abuse unit was renamed ""The Strecker Program"" in his honor; and in 1989, it was named ""Treatment Center of the Year"" by the American Council on Alcoholism.
During the early 20th century, The Institute also introduced outpatient treatment for those with, what was then known as Psycho-Neurosis, -- everyday family and work-related problems, such as: anxiety, sleeplessness, depression or low self-esteem. Psychotic patients in the Institute were transferred to the 44th Street location to make way for outpatient services geared to the community at large. The Institute thus became one of the few hospital programs nationally to treat patients ranging from the severely mentally-ill, to those needing help with the stresses of their everyday living. This is commonly regarding as the beginning of the de-institutionalization movement, which in tragic irony, would ultimately have the Institute itself shut down.
Once surrounded by 130-acres of grounds, the hospital by the 1930's was now contained in approximately 27-acres bounded on the North and South by Haverford Avenue and Market Street, and on the East and West by 48th and 49th Streets respectively. The hospital continued to expand, and had many new buildings added during this period. Two additions were made to the Kirkbride original structure. The auditorium on the northern side of the north wing, which runs east to west (which still stands. Additionally, a wing extended back from the primary entrance building and connects with the northern extension off the original central building. The land to the north of the original structure was developed and occupied by a series of maintenance and clinical buildings, all constructed between 1929 And 1959. Open grounds to the south and east of the hospital wards were still open to the public at this time. However, a number of interior alterations of the original structures were done as a means of keeping up with modernization of medical practices. The 22-foot high ceilings were lowered, many of the grands halls had been interrupted by individual partitions, and most of the smaller patients' rooms were converted into offices for hospital staff.
In 1934, Dr. Joseph Hughes joined the medical staff of the Institute. At a time when insulin and other physio-chemical shock therapies were in common use for the treatment of psychiatric disorder, Dr. Hughes did extensive research into potential clinical alternatives. At the time there was no other modality to treat patients who did not respond to Occupational Therapy, medication or ongoing psychotherapy. Dr. Hughes became increasingly fascinated with the practice of two Italian physicians who were employing electro-shock therapy on their patients- which alters the chemical balance and response of the brain. AS of 1940, Dr. Hughes began to construct and experiment with his own device for electro-shock therapy. What resulted was a model for all future electro-shock therapy units. By his own admission, Dr. Hughes admitted that this new form of therapy was experimental, but stated that it was never used coercively or unjustly by attending hospital medical staff.
The Female Department Building on 44th Street was closed in 1959 due to the City of Philadelphia exercising its right of eminent domain of the property. Items from the original building were auctioned off with a frightening degree of haste. Shortly thereafter, the building was demolished to make way for the City's subway and mass transit projects. All patients were moved to the Male Department on 49th Street, which became the exclusive facility for the Institute. A new, five-story ""North Building"" opened to accommodate the consolidation of departments. Within a decade this building became the site of the area's first inpatient treatment center for adolescent children. It is this stricture that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark on October 15, 1966.
The Pennsylvania Hospital School of Nursing for Men, founded by Dr. Copp, is dissolved in 1965 after having graduated five hundred and fifty-one men, and trained approximately twelve thousand affiliates during it's 51-year history. Also at this time, 'the School of Nursing for Women', which operates out of the Pennsylvania Hospital's 8th Street facility is also dissolved, and a cooperative school which accepts both male and female students is founded in a coed atmosphere. This school continued exist until 1974, when the nursing school was completely dissolved due to lack of interest.
In 1969, Hall-Mercer Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center was moved to its own building, as the need for outpatient care greatly expanded in the past five decades. Following talks with University of Pennsylvania Health System, Pennsylvania's Board of Managers elected to merge with the larger health system. It also specified that cost cutting measures were necessary to remain financially viable for the future. In the fall of 1997 it was specified that the 157-year old facility in West Philadelphia would be shut down, as major repairs to their building and equipment would be needed to modernize. However, it was deemed more reasonable to have all psychiatry, psychological and neurological services resume at Pennsylvania Hospital's original campus on 8th street in Center City Philadelphia. However, the structure of the former Institute was still above the city;s code for a medical facility, since the hospital was renovated extensively in 1989. The North building of the former Institute was repurposed in 1998 as the Kirkbride Center.
The current psychiatric services of the University of Pennsylvania Health System are divided by several sites within the Philadelphia area. There are two inpatient units at Pennsylvania Hospital, '4-Spruce' containing 24-beds, and '6-Spruce' containing 18-beds. Penn Presbyterian Medical Center also holds two inpatient units, 'Wright 4' containing 18-beds, and 'Wright 5' containing 22-beds. A Psychiatric Emergency Evaluation (PEEC) is also on site at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, which is contracted with the City of Philadelphia to handle 302 commitment petitions.
Over the years the particular name of the Institute has changed a number of times, as well as the title of the Chief Operating Officer. The popular title of ""Superintendent"", which was used by many psychiatric hospitals of the 19th century, was dropped in 1918 and replaced with the more progressive ""Psychiatrist-in-Chief"", which it remains for the next six decades. The title was split with the resignation of Dr. Myers in 1981. Dr. Fischer was thereafter named as 'Director of Psychiatry', with the now lesser title of Psychiatrist-in-Chief going to Dr. Layton McCurdy, who retained it until the closure of the Institute in 1997.
The Hospital Superintendent did not exercise total control over the administration and internal hospital policy. Two members of the Board of Managers would visit for inspection every Saturday in 9:30 in the morning. These inspections went on regularly for the 157 years of the hospital's existence.
Following the closure of the Institute and the purchase of the hospital, Pennsylvania Hospital's psychiatric services department were joined with that of others in the Department of Psychiatry in the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Many former physicians of the west campus hospital maintain close times with: Hall-Mercer CMHMR, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania or Penn Presbyterian Hospital, as well as that of Pennsylvania Hospital proper.
In 1887, or thereabout, the Board of Managers at Pennsylvania Hospital became acutely aware of the recent urban growth around their West Philadelphia campus, and decided to invest in a potential move for their facility to a site that was still rural and open. This was seen as a necessary clinical development, as all psychiatric hospitals of the time were removed from urban centers, so that they might be best employed as retreats for individuals who suffered from emotional or cognitive disturbances. Slowly properties were purchased to accommodate this move outside of the limits of the city of Philadelphia. 600 acres of farmland were obtained near what is now Newtown Square which was surveyed for potential construction of a new hospital. The site already contained an old mansion house located near West Chester Road on the south, and on the west by the Newtown and Paoli Road. The old mansion was refurbished and altered for the benefit of patients, and approximately eight patients were accepted to that site for ongoing treatment as early as 1890. All patients who were sent to this site were deemed non-acute by their attending physician, and therefore not in need of being on a locked psychiatric unit. This was a peculiar clinical operation, as inpatient psychiatric care had previously only existed in the context of formal hospital or Sanitarium. It is never specified in the surviving records why this move failed to take place, only that it stops being mentioned by hospital administration.
Following the failure of the move to materialize, the Newtown campus remained open to patients for several decades. Another attempt to explore this transfer as a potential option was made in 1930 by the Board of Managers, but it too never came fully to fruition, mainly due to the economic woes of the Great Depression and a continually declining inpatient hospital census. A cottage plan for this potential campus was drawn up at that time, and continues to remain on file within the Pennsylvania Hospital Library. Female patients continued to be present at this campus for some time afterward, however, males were not kept in residence following a change in internal policy in 1928. A fire of unknown origin destroyed much of the original farmhouse in 1945. Seeing this site as superfluous to the mission of the hospital, a large section of the property was sold off to private owners in 1949. As of 1960 Pennsylvania Hospital continued to own a small fraction of the former site, which was, at the time, totally undeveloped. This building, known as ""The Ashley"" was located along what is now Ashley Road in Newtown Sqaure.
Following the closure of the Institute in 1998, three tall housing projects and a multi-purpose social-service facility were built near the grounds of the original 1841 Kirkbride hospital. Other parts of the property were sold for commercial and residential development in 2001, and in the due course of time many historic buildings belonging to the complex were demolished. There are still a number of abandoned structures on the property that are not currently being leased. The primary building of the former Institute was acquired in 1998 by Blackwell Human Services, to which they agreed to pay $700,000 a year for 130,000 square feet at the facility now operated as the Kirkbride Center. The lease agreement is part of a flurry of activity at the 27-acre West Philadelphia campus. As of 2010, the structure remains part of the Blackwell Human Services Corporation, and houses: the West Philadelphia ACES Charter School, Pennsylvania Hospital's Mill Creek School, Philadelphia Health Management Corporation's Adolescent Residential Treatment Center and Traveler's Aid's emergency family shelter. Over the front entrance of the 1959 expansion the engraving 'Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital' remains. The large Victorian dome of Dr. Kirkbride's original hospital, with its elaborate frescoes, is also still standing, but it is in poor condition, as it has not been maintained in several decades.
The current 'Kirkbride Center' is the area's largest non-hospital inpatient program with 137-beds serving the Philadelphia area; drug and alcohol, long and short term residential, detoxification, and methadone treatment are all available as inpatient services on-site. While the Kirkbride Center still maintains a psychiatric ward, their specialization is significantly relegated to 28-day drug rehabilitation. They do, however, like to celebrate Dr. Kirkbride and his contribution to the development of mental healthcare.
Large sections of the former site are now abandoned and have not seen active clinical or professional use since 1997 when operations were shut down. While the campus is still technically owned by the University of Pennsylvania Health System there have been no plans to either restore or demolish the other buildings present on campus at this time. Considering their poor condition, structural age, and the decreased revenue from inpatient psychiatric care it is unlike that they will be re-employed anytime in the near future. Yet, unlike many other sites sentinel to the history of psychiatry and behavioral healthcare, this campus was never greatly damaged by vandals or physically compromised by trespassers with pernicious intentions. The fact that this site has been active since the closure of the original hospital might be a partial deterrent. There have been talks in recent months by Philadelphia city officials to establish a police headquarters in the former Provident Mutual Building, which neighbors the old West Philadelphia campus of the hospital, to help restore and re-gentrify the surrounding neighborhood. However, as of March 2012, this remains in the development stages, as the structure requires massive renovations due to water damage and alterations for its future forensic use. Mayor Michael Nutter has obtained nine million dollars to move forward on the completion of this project, which is currently scheduled for completion in late 2016. Locals in West Philadelphia, and in the region in general, are still familiar with the campus' prior history as the epicenter of American Psychiatry. Yet, there has been no move to commemorate this spot by any state agency, or on behalf of the American Psychiatric Association. The oldest remaining part of the campus, the former ""Male Department"" proper, was registered as a US National Historic Landmark in the fall of 1966.
In 1971, the Institute opened up a co-educational school licensed by the state as part of their inpatient adolescent treatment program. Originally known as the ""High School of the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital"" it was renamed in February of 1972. Originally, the school was deemed to be more therapeutic then academic. Teachers placed a strong emphasis on learning a therapeutic activity, rather than the content of the education. However, in more recent years this has shifted substantially, and the Mill Creek School was designed to mirror a traditional high school, without any specification of grades. Students are given a pass/fail grade at the end of every term. Teachers are usually young and able to relate to their students. The school remains active on the hospital grounds, even after the closure of the Institute, educating students who were found less capable in a traditional academic atmosphere.
The Institute opened the region's first inpatient unit exclusively for adolescents in 1974, long before that of its primary competitors in Philadelphia, Friends Hospital and Belmont Behavioral Health. A specialized unit for eating disorders was also introduced to the hospital in 1986, when the Institute still lead the nation in the use of modern psychiatric care. While not revolutionary in the modern context, as most psychiatric hospitals have specialized units, this was considered particular for the time period. Also, Pennsylvania Hospital was famous for possessing a unit for 'Experimental Psychiatry', where various studies were conducted on the nature of hypnosis, and hypnotherapy, and its successful use in the course of inpatient care. The majority of these studies were conducted by the Director of the unit, Dr. Martin Orne, starting as early as 1964, in association with the University of Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Hospital,"May 11, 1751",1752,1752,Active,Single Building,Samuel Rhoads / David Evans Jr.,,"Pennsylvania Hospital was founded, in what is now Southeastern Philadelphia, on May 11, 1751 by founding father Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, as the first medical hospital in the United States of America. New York Hospital in Manhattan would take the honor of being the second of such hospitals. Pennsylvania Hospital, also known as ""Pennsy"" locally, continues to treat both somatic medical conditions as well as an array of psychiatric disorders. It is also home to the first surgical amphitheater and first medical library for public use in the Americas. It has been continuously active for clinical purposes since its initial opening some three centuries ago, and is now affiliated with the much larger University of Pennsylvania Health System, which services the greater Philadelphia area. It should not be confused with the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, which was a facility in West Philadelphia employed as a psychiatric annex of the primary medical campus of Pennsylvania Hospital. The seal of the hospital, chosen by Franklin and Bond themselves, incorporates the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan and the employs the phrase ""Take Care of Him and I will repay Thee"" (Luke 10:35) taken from the New Testament.
In 1752, the first temporary building was opened on High (now Market) Street in Philadelphia for the treatment of the ill in Philadelphia. Elizabeth Gardner, a Quaker widow well known in the city, was appointed it's Matron. Prior to this time, medical treatment was reserved to private doctor visits to houses regional, no such professional medical facility had been established in colonial America. Much of the original funding for the site and its maintenance came from the Society of Friends, better known as the 'Quakers', who stressed the importance of public facilities in the young city.
In 1755, the cornerstone was laid for the East Wing of what would become the hospital's permanent location at 8th and Pine Streets. Patients were first admitted to the permanent hospital in 1756. The site continued to grow through the years with the addition of more wings, such as the West Wing of the building which was built in 1796. In 1762, the first book for the hospital's medical library was donated by John Fothergill, a British friend of Benjamin Franklin. In 1847, the American Medical Association designated the library as the first, largest, and most important medical library in the United States. The collection now contains over 13,000 volumes dating back to the 15th century--including medical and scientific volumes as well as books on natural history. The library includes the nation's most complete collection of medical books published between 1750 and 1850. The collection also contains several incunabula, books written before 1501, when the printed process was invented.
The top floor of Pennsylvania Hospital is the home of the nation's oldest surgical amphitheater. The amphitheater served as the operating room from 1804 through 1868. Surgeries were performed on sunny days between 11:00 am and 2:00 pm since there was no electricity at the time. The surgical amphitheater seats 180 and with those standing, up to 300 people might be present during any given surgical operation. It is open to the public for tours at certain hours of the weekday.
The Physic Garden is the jewel in the crown that makes up the greater part of the grounds of Pennsylvania Hospital gardens. The Board of Managers first proposed the Physic Garden in 1774, to provide physicians with ingredients for their prescribed medications. The idea was approved, but financial circumstances intervened and the project was delayed for two centuries. In 1976, the planting of the garden was the bicentennial project of the Philadelphia Committee of the Garden Club of America and the Friends of Pennsylvania Hospital. Located in front of the Pine Building's West Wing, the garden has plants that were used for medicines in the 18th century. Once used to stimulate the heart, ease toothaches, relieve indigestion and cleanse wounds, now their shaded respite provides healing of a more spiritual kind for patients and visitors alike.
Pennsylvania Hospital gained a reputation as a center of innovation and medical advancement, particularly in the area of maternity. In its early years it was also known for its particularly advanced and humane facilities for mentally ill patients at a time when mental illness was very poorly understood and patients were often treated very badly.
In 1950 Pennsylvania Hospital was recognized for becoming more highly specialized as it established, in addition to its sophisticated maternity programs, an intensive care unit for neurological patients, a coronary care unit, an orthopedic institute, a diabetes center, a hospice, specialized units in oncology and urology and broadened surgical programs.
The hospital was also a center through the years for treating the war wounded. Patients were brought to the hospital for treatment in the Revolutionary War, the American Civil War and the Spanish American War, and units from the hospital were sent abroad to treat wounded in World War I and in World War II (to the Pacific theater).
When Pennsylvania Hospital was originally envisioned by its founders, their concerns were two fold. First, that the public health could be preserved through a public facility to aid the poor and sickly within Philadelphia itself. Secondly, that the issue of the city's growing Lunatick population could be addressed through a medical resolution to hospitalized those so afflicted. Of the first six patients brought in for inpatient care, four of them were being treated for ""diseases of the mind"". For much of its early history, the hospital maintained a patient census that was one-third psychiatric, something that was unthinkable in contrast to European hospitals of the time. However, much like it's European counterparts, Pennsylvania hospital housed much of its early psychiatric patients in the cellar, in conditions that have been described as ""damp and unwholesome"". It was customary clinical procedure at that time to chain patients to the wall as a preventative measure. Many of these chains are currently on display in the museum present on the grounds of the modern Pennsylvania Hospital.
Conditions, as reported, were poor at best, and many of those who were received at the hospital for this type of treatment inevitably succumb to pulmonary disease. In 1758, two male patient succeeded in parting the iron bars of their cells, and escaped into the Philadelphia night. They accomplished this seven times before significant alterations were made to prevent their reoccurring elopement. Escapes were common in this early period, and moreover, often prompted by the poor conditions of the psychiatric ward. In August of 1773, seven elopements were recorded alone. Following careful consideration, the Board of Manager of Pennsylvania Hospital stated that they would permit wealthier patients to have private quarters, that would be clean and removed from the general public. This they offered for an additional fee of ten dollars per week. Private orderlies were also available upon the request of the patient or the patient's family. The general psychiatric unit, however, remained unaltered by this decision. This feature of private, specialized care for the affluent and powerful would remain a special feature of the Department of Psychiatry within Pennsylvania Hospital until 1997.
For many centuries prior, in France and England in particular, incarcerated Lunaticks were regarded as somewhat of an amusement by local denizens, who frequently would laugh and jeer at them behind their bars. This was also the case of Pennsylvania Hospital during the 18th century, and there are many reports of local residents agitating those confined and hurling insults at them from the street. In 1763, this problem was alleviated when a hatch door was installed leading from the street to the 'lunatick ward'. Admission was offered for the price of four pence to help offset the clinical expenses of running the hospital and its various charity cases. This practice continued for an unspecified amount of time. It was still in place in 1784, when the resident alienists stated that firmer regulations should be put on hospital visitors, as they discovered that this practice in many cases further exacerbated patients' conditions. Public visitation was limited to two persons at a time, and they are to ""go into the cells and those persons to be attended by the cell keeper, and not suffered to speak with such patients."" This perspective of psychiatric patients as being sub-human, while out of place in modernity, was part of the zeitgeist of that age. The ability to reason, and have possession of one's one reason, was considered the acid test of humanity. Those who ignored, violated, or were otherwise unable to come to their senses by their own volition were therefore deemed to be outside humanity.
Some of the patients would rise to become local celebrities within Philadelphia itself during the 18th century. One such patient, only known to history as the ""lunatic hermit"", who was a ""remarkably neat and tidy sailor"". He was admitted in 1765, during which time he actively fought with patients and staff alike, refusing to sleep in his room. He eloped into the cupola over the east wing on the hospital, where he demanded to take up residence. The tired and frustrated staff yielded to this demand, and he remained a permit resident of the cupola for the next ten years, until her died in 1774. The local residents often spoke of the stranger, who paced the cupola with his long fingernails and matted beard.
Within its first thirty years as a public institution, the demographics of the hospital changed considerably. By the close of the American Revolution the greater majority of the patients were committed as Lunaticks, rather than for a medical illness. The reason for this shift is debatable. However, the most likely reason is the practical economics that the Board of Managers faced. Those patients who were committed for somatic ailments were often from the poorer classes, and frequently relied on charity care. In contrast, psychiatric cases were commonly from wealthier families who helped fund the hospital and made its continued expansion possible. With all due consideration, the inpatient population of the mentally ill continued to expand progressively, year after year. While no hospital record stating this as official policy has ever been found, the census record certainly suggest it as a certainty.
More than any other single individual, Dr. Benjamin Rush was responsible for advancing the clinical knowledge and practice of behavioral healthcare. Like Galen, Rush died a superstitious origin to behavioral problems, claiming that moonbeams, Daemons, foul odors, celibacy, excessive tobacco use, did not cause psychiatric issues. Rather, that these behavioral disturbances were caused by ""diseases of the brain"", and should be treated properly with medical attention. Rush was also an advocate of the humane treatment of his patients, rejecting their previously held social status as unreasonable, and therefore sub-human. He proposed, that since these issues were disease of the mind, patients should be treated with the same care as those who suffered from a somatic malady. While the ethical nature of this claim was questioned in later century, for the 18th and early 19th century it was perceived as a peculiar formal method. This medical and metaphysical dogma dogma stood against common perceptions, as well as the formal education Rush received at the hands of psychiatric experts, such as Dr. William Cullen of Edinburgh.
Additionally, Rush is remembered for a new therapeutic apparatus that he employed on his patients. Commonly known as the ""Tranquilizing Chair"", Rush designed this machine to help reduce the flood of blood toward the brain. This was considered to make reasonable sense under the medical logic of the time, as it was thought that ""the blood is the life"" (Lev. 17:14). Ergo, by slowing done the 'force of life' within a Lunatick patient, their manic features might be reduced as well. In practical application this device certainly reduced psycho-motor activity of the confined patient, as well as their muscular tension, and the frequency of the pulse, but it became abundantly obvious to other alienists that it did not reduce the presenting symptoms of the patient. Regardless, Rush thought that this device was preferable to the ""Mad-coats"" (better known as a straightjacket) that most Lunatick were restrained in at the time.
Rush postulated that Insanity could be caused by physiological issues, or because of a moral failing in the individual. For this reason, Rush drew upon the centuries old Thomistic philosophy of Western Europe, that health required moderation in all things. Therefore, those individuals who engage in: excessive drinking, strange preoccupations, sexual or religious fervor, all lacked the moderation necessary to maintain mental health, and subsequently fell into bouts of insanity. This belief in the moral basis for the development of insanity was a common belief within the professional psychiatric community well into the 20th century. For better clinical care Rush deemed that these patients could attain homeostasis if they were simply given the opportunity to live a moderate and well-balanced lifestyle. For this reason, in 1798, he ordered that those patients who had the physical capacity to work should do so, to assist as part of their recovery. He proposed spinning, sewing and churning for his female patients, and for men, gardening and mill-grinding. This theory of recovery through work would be the roots of Occupational Therapy, which is still employed by many inpatient and outpatient clinics as a means of assisting with psychiatric recovery.
The Hospital's Board of Managers voted to expand their facility for care of the mentally ill in 1840, as much of the original Pennsylvania was occupied by psychiatric patients. A site was select in, what was then, rural West Philadelphia in 1841 with the construction of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, later known as The Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital. The Board also elected to hire  Thomas Story Kirkbride as its first superintendent. This new separate facilities developed a treatment philosophy that became the standard for care of the insane in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This facility remained in operation for the next century and a half. However, the changing economics of psychiatry in the later half of the 20th century made inpatient care expensive and difficult to obtain. In 1997, Pennsylvania Hospital's Board of Managers made the decision to merge with the much larger University of Pennsylvania Health System, this also meant the closure of the Institute as an independent facility. All operation of psychiatric care resumed at Pennsylvania Hospital's primary location following its closure. The large Penn Health System continues to help to support the Pennsylvania Hospital as a stand-alone hospital with its vast regional network of resources.
The current psychiatric services of the University of Pennsylvania Health System are divided by several sites within the Philadelphia area. There are two inpatient units at Pennsylvania Hospital, '4-Spruce' containing 24-beds, and '6-Spruce' containing 18-beds. Penn Presbyterian Medical Center also holds two inpatient units, 'Wright 4' containing 18-beds, and 'Wright 5' containing 22-beds. A Psychiatric Emergency Evaluation (PEEC) is also on site at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, which is contracted with the City of Philadelphia to handle 302 commitment petitions.

Pennsylvania,Saint Francis Hospital for the Insane,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Saint_Francis_Hospital_for_the_Insane,1865,,1876,Demolished,Rambling Plan,,Saint Francis Hospital,"The St. Francis Health Center began as a small construction in November 1865 when friends of Mother Mary Margaret, the Superioress of the Franciscan Sisters in Buffalo, petitioned her to send her coworkers to Pittsburgh to establish a hospital. She sent Sister Mary Elizabeth, Sister Magdalen, and Sister Stephen to Pittsburgh where they obtained a house on 37th Street in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood with 15 beds for the sick. In May of the following year, they obtained a six acre plot on 44th Street where they set up a hospital with enough room for 30 patients, later adding a chapel to the building over Thanksgiving. The hospital saw its first influx of patients during the Pittsburgh smallpox epidemic that lasted from 1866 to 1872. During that time, the hospital was granted a charter by the state of Pennsylvania and by 1871 the hospital was expanded to three stories.
After the city experienced another bout of smallpox in 1876, the hospital was further expanded to accommodate the mentally ill. Several remodels and expansions took place from 1890 until 1910 and in 1919 the Sisters of Saint Francis of Millvale, now separate from their Buffalo community, established the St. Francis Hospital Training School of Nurses. In 1984, the Sisters expanded their health system to Cranberry Township, Butler County, which included a hospital, heliport, and administrative offices.
By August 2002, the St. Francis Health System was experiencing financial difficulties and ownership was eventually transferred to Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh as part of a contract between Highmark, Inc. and UPMC Health System. St. Francis complex was demolished to make rooom for the new site for the UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP).",2002,"Pittsburgh, PA",,
Pennsylvania,U.S. Naval Asylum and Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=U.S._Naval_Asylum_and_Hospital,,"April 3, 1827",,Closed and Preserved,Single Building,William Strickland,U.S Naval Home,"The site of the U.S. Naval Asylum in Philadelphia has had a long and varied history, from a country seat of pre-Revolutionary Philadelphia gentry to its impending reinvention as luxury housing.
The 20.7 acre campus at Grays Ferry Avenue served as the Naval Asylum (later called the Naval Home) from the completion of its central building in 1833 to its closing in 1976. It contains three buildings — the central Biddle Hall flanked by the Surgeon's residence to the left and the Governor's residence to the right — designed by architect William Strickland and considered one of the best examples of Greek Revival architecture in the country. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.
The Naval Asylum stands on the site of ""The Plantation,"" one of the country residences of the prominent Philadelphia Pemberton family. The property was purchased by William Pemberton from John Kinsey, who in turn purchased it from Thomas Masters, who purchased it from the Penns. It was under the protection of the British forces while they occupied Philadelphia during the Revolution, and following the Revolution it passed to Thomas Abbot.
In 1826 ""the Abbot lot, of about 23 acres"" was purchased by Surgeon Thomas Harris at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy. ""The Plantation"" served as the Naval Hospital from 1826-1833, during the construction of the new building.
William Strickland was appointed ""to make the necessary contracts for materials and superintend the building of a permanent asylum for disabled seamen, &c, at Philadelphia."" Thomas Harris was also appointed superintendent, probably to carry out sanitary arrangements. The cornerstone was laid on April 3, 1827.
William Strickland (b. 1788), a carpenter's son, was born and grew up in Philadelphia, where he studied architecture and engineering with Benjamin Latrobe, who would later design the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington.
Strickland shared Latrobe's interest in Greek Revival architecture, although Strickland had never been to Greece and his knowledge of these historic buildings came primarily from the engravings in Stuart and Revett's Antiquities of Athens. By the time Strickland was appointed architect for the Naval Asylum, he had been responsible for several monumental civic buildings in Philadelphia, including the Second Bank of the United States. The Second Bank was based on the Stuart and Revett drawings of the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis; the Naval Asylum would draw its inspiration from the Ionic Temple of Ilyssus from the same source.
The design of the Naval Asylum was based on the very latest principles of hospital design, with individual rooms for 400 pensioners. Each room was both well-lighted and well-ventilated by windows opening onto verandahs that ran the length of the wings in both front and back.The building's design also included common rooms for dining, smoking and reading, as well as a chapel and other lounges. The building was designed to be fireproof, with masonry walls and vaulted ceilings, and was among the first to use cast iron as a building material.
Strickland originally estimated the cost of construction to be $118,700. Work went quickly in 1827 but slowed in 1828 and 1829 as payments slowed. Costs rose, partially in response to design changes. As Strickland wrote to the Naval Hospital Commissioners in April 1829, ""It very rarely happens in the construction of public works of this kind that some excess beyond the estimated cost does not take place; in this case a change from rough-cut to finished marble and granite for the rear of the building it is owing eventually to a strong desire to produce not only durability, but a suitable and defined architectural finish.""
Strickland resigned as superintendent at the end of 1829. His final report, reprinted in Hazard's Register of Pennsylvania, gives a total of $198,000 expended to date, with an estimate of $242,000 in total costs. The final cost of the building was $249,185.60 and the total cost, including land and the wharves on the Schuyllkill, would be $276,332.45. The handsome marble and granite structure, 385 feet in length, had a copper roof on the center section and slate on the wings.
When Strickland resigned as superintendent, the roof had been completed and the structure was weathertight, allowing the safe storage of materials until construction could be resumed, and the care of the Naval Asylum was transferred to Commodore William Bainbridge, commandant of the Navy Yard. In July 1832 Congress appropriated the sum estimated by Strickland to be needed to complete the building, and construction resumed.
Progress on the building was reported by Atkinson in Atkinson's Casket or Gems of Literature, Wit and Sentiment, December 1832, (reprinted in his Saturday Evening Post for January 5, 1833), and in Hazard's Register of Pennsylvania, November 1832. The building was complete and partially furnished by December 3, 1833, and housed patients from the old ""Plantation"" hospital building by the end of the year.
As the Asylum was nearing completion Philadelphia was concerned about the hazards of cholera, with reports of five cases of cholera following the report on the Asylum in Hazard's Register. The paper was quick to report that ""our atmosphere, we believe, is now as pure and healthy as it ever has been; indeed…decidedly purer and healthier than it was three or four weeks ago."" Atkinson devoted several paragraphs to the healthfulness of the site of the Asylum, which ""has been fully tested, and has been found equal in this respect to any place within ten miles of it. I have been assured that during the present season, there has not occurred a single case of fever of any kind among the patients, attendants, workmen, and officers connected with this institution.""
In 1838 the Naval Asylum was placed under the governorship of Commodore James Biddle, and Daniel Bowen, in his A History of Philadelphia, would write: ""From the rear verandahs of the Asylum, one of the most delightful views is obtained, of which the city can boast. The Schuylkill river, covered with whitened craft; the palace of the poor (Almshouse) over the river; Fair Mount to the right; the Baronial castle, of the State Penitentiary, and Girard College beyond, with many other beautiful objects, delight most, the attention. We should say to strangers, visiting the city, that they ought not to neglect a visit to the Asylum."" A woodcut of the Asylum appears opposite the title page of Bowen's history. The Almshouse referred to here is the Blockley Almshouse, also designed by Strickland.
In 1837 the Swiss artist John Caspar Wild formed a partnership with J. B. Chevalier to publish lithographs of the city of Philadelphia. This was the third series of general views of Philadelphia, the first to use lithography, and most of the twenty views were of recently constructed buildings. The prints, published in 1838, were not a commercial success for Wild, who sold the stones to J. T. Bowen that same year and moved to the midwest. Wild's engraving of the Naval Asylum is widely reproduced.
When Biddle Hall was constructed, its surroundings were largely rural. Although Grays Ferry Road was the principal approach to the city from the south, residential development at the time was concentrated along Broad Street, Market Street, and Rittenhouse Square, with isolated pockets of housing west of Rittenhouse Square and north of South Street. In the immediate vicinity there was no development other than the U.S. Arsenal south of the Naval Asylum site. The rural character of the area can be seen in this 1847 watercolor by Augustus Köllner.
From 1839 to 1845, Biddle Hall housed three naval functions — the asylum for retired sailors, a naval hospital, and a naval academy for midshipmen. In response to friction arising from this multiple use, William Strickland was retained in 1842 to create a lath and plaster partition across the middle of the building, with the northern wing housing the asylum and academy and the southern wing the hospital. The pensioners complained at being crowded four to a room, so in 1844 the partition was removed again and in 1845 the academy was moved to Annapolis, Maryland. In 1844 two Strickland-designed residences — one for the Governor of the Asylum and one for the Surgeon of the Hospital — were built to the north and south of Biddle Hall, and one can be seen in the Köllner watercolor.
In 1848 the appearance of Biddle Hall was changed with the raising of the attic roof and the addition of dormers to house additional pensioners. These additions can be seen in the Rolfe photo to the right, printed in Moses King's 1901Views of Philadelphia. (Strickland's biographer, Agnes Addison Gilchrist, dates these additions to the 1870s.)
The need for additional hospital housing was exacerbated by the outbreak of the Civil War, when the influx of wounded to the hospital wing again strained the building's capacity. In 1864 and 1865 Congress appropriated funds for the construction of new hospital building on the grounds of the Naval Asylum. The Second Empire building, designed by John McArthur? and called Laning Hall, was completed in 1868. By then the number of patients had dwindled again, and portions of the new hospital facility were used to house pensioners. (Laning Hall can be seen in the aerial photograph taken from the west side of the Schuylkill in 1935, below.)
By the 1860s the area along the Schuylkill began to see some industrial development, and a rail line crossed the river by the Arsenal and continued along Prime Street (now Washington Avenue). Residential development south of South Street had extended as far as 19th Street. Following the end of the Civil War, residential development continued at a rapid pace, and some governors of the Asylum were deploring the pernicious influence of the built-up city on the pensioners. Not all shared this view, and by 1886 Charles Stockton, compiling a history of the Asylum for the Department of the Navy, could write:
""On the 1st of October, 1886, the beneficiaries on the rolls numbered two hundred and one....Each beneficiary has a separate room; the supply of food at the table is ample and varied. There is a liberal allowance of clothing, lately much improved.... There is a fair library of over two thousand volumes, four pleasant reading-rooms with a supply of daily and weekly papers and other periodicals. Cards, backgammon, and other games are furnished, and liberty to smoke as much as is desired. In many instances the inmates fit up their rooms very comfortably, and with considerable taste, from their pocket money or other sources. The privacy given by these small rooms is highly prized by the men, and the additional independence and dignity given is of great value in fostering the sense of honorable retirement. No restraint is put upon the liberty of the beneficiaries during reasonable hours, so long as the men behave themselves, and do not forfeit this privilege by bad conduct...
""Many who are not past all service obtain leave of absence, generally for a few months or a year, and ship during the summer months on yachts, coasters, or occasionally on receiving-ships, and by a renewal of these leaves spend many years away before taking up their final abode in the Asylum. Others, who remain inmates, often find light employment either in workshops outside or at making fancy work, mats, hammocks, &c., within the building, earning some money in this way for themselves. A number are also employed by the Government at the institution as quartermasters, inside watchmen, gatekeepers, mail carriers &c., for which they are paid a moderate sum. It was at one time proposed to form a museum at the Asylum, but it was abandoned. There are a few relics of interest still there.""
In 1889 the name of the institution was changed from the U. S. Naval Asylum to the U. S. Naval Home. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971. The Naval Home remained in continuous operation until 1976, when the remaining pensioners were transferred to a new facility in Gulfport, MS. The property was sold to residential developer Toll Brothers in 1988 for $1,200,000. Toll Brothers neglected the site for many years, not even bothering to secure it from vandals. The beautiful buildings were quickly broken into, vandalized, and covered in spray paint. In February of 2003 a five alarm fire broke out. Preservation experts believe that despite the apparent devastation, much of this National Historic Landmark can be rebuilt. After some time, several trips to court, and continued attention by the the media, the city, preservationists, and neighbors, developer Toll Brothers began working to remove debris, clear the site of weeds and brush, and begin the process of replacing the roof destroyed in the February 3 fire and restoring the building as the centerpiece of a development of luxury homes and condos. In 2005 Toll Brothers finally completed re-construction of the buildings and the building opened once again as a massive luxury housing development.

Pennsylvania,Adams County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Adams_County_Almshouse,,1820,,Demolished,Pre-1854 Plans,,Adams County Home | Adams County Hospital for the Insane,"The Adams County Almshouse was built in 1820 to care for the poor of Adams County one mile from Gettysburg on the Harrisburg Turnpike. The almshouse property included 270 aces of land which was worked for the institutions benefit. The original almshouse complex consisted of three buildings, the almshouse proper, the infirmary, and the old insane hospital. The main building was a two story brick structure with a basement, measuring 70 by 40 ft. The old insane building was also was a two story brick structure with basement, measuring 95 by 20 ft. The infirmary, which housed the counties sick measured 60 by 32 feet and was also a two story structure of brick. The capacity of these structures was 125 people.
During the Battle of Gettysburg the Almshouse property was located in close proximity to the battle, its location being just northeast of Gettysburg and along the initial Union Line on the first day of fighting. Just north of the Almshouse was a knoll, which the Almshouse's cemetery was located on. General Barlow's division, part of the Union XI Corps took position on the Knoll. However their location on the edge of the Union line and the knoll's position further forward of supporting divisions created a salient. Barlow's position was hit from both flanks and overrun, leading to the collapse of the Union right flank and the confederate lines moving past the Almshouse by the end of the first day. This area is know called Barlow's Knoll. From the beginning the Almshouse was utilized by both armies as a field hospital to care for the wounded.
After the Civil War an 1886 report was made on the hospital. According to the report the three buildings were found to be in poor repair and all described as unsuitable for use as either an almshouse or a hospital. The provisions for separating the sexes was found to be inadequate and management of the almshouse poor as a whole. The 20 insane and imbecile residents were found to be living in poor conditions in a cellar and often were kept in chains. Female insane and imbeciles were said to have engaged in sexual activities with ""men from the road"". Unfortunately accounts of such things is very common for rural county almshouses at the time.
In 1881, thanks to the efforts of Dr O'Neil, the chief physician, a separate building for the care of the insane was erected. The building was of bricke and two stories tall with a basement and attic, measuring 30 by 60 feet. This building could accommodate 12 patients of each sex. An 1885 report remarked that for whatever reason the county did not sent its recent cases of insanity to the state hospital for treatment.
By 1885 the almshouse property consisted of 240 acres, 190 of which were cultivated and 2 were under garden husbandry. The crops raised were wheat, corn, rye, and various vegetable, which were used for the almshouse.
This Almshouse complex was shut down in 1964 and many of the buildings demolished over time. In 1974 the last building, the 1881 building for the insane, was demolished.
The Almshouse cemetery remains in its original location on Barlow's Knoll. It contains the graves of the dead from the county complex and the poor and unidentified departed of Adams County. Located at N 39° 50.688 W 077° 13.638

Pennsylvania,Mayview State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Allegheny_City_Home,1938 (As a PA State Hospital),1892,,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Mayview Poor House | Marshalsea | Pittsburgh City Home and Hospital at Mayview,"In 1804 a building was completed in the newly incorporated City of Pittsburgh. The new building was the city's first ""poor house"", it held a population of 30. In 1818, an increase in the size of the indigent population resulted in the construction of the Allegheny City Almshouse. By 1846, with the continued increase in patients, the city was scouting sites for yet another new almshouse. Roughly 150 acres were acquired along the banks of the Monongahela River at Homestead, in Mifflin township and a three-story brick building was built to hold 300 patients. The City Poor Farm at Homestead opened in 1852 and by 1879 a separate building was erected for treatment of the insane. With a burgeoning population and a conviction that rural settings were healthier, especially for tuberculosis patients, the city made plans to move the hospital again, this time it would be located well outside the city boundaries. Land along the Monongahela was valuable and the city sold its almshouse acreage to the Carnegie Steel Company for $450,000.
The city bought the George Neal Farm in what is now South Fayette Township at Upper St. Clair., and set up a rail station. In 1892 construction on a new hospital named Marshalsea began. A separate building for the insane was erected, and in 1899, and a physician was assigned to the insane department. In response to the need for adequate medical care for inmates, a general hospital was also erected at this site in 1909. Allegheny City, located on Pittsburgh's North Side, also maintained an institution for the poor and insane at Claremont that later became known as Blawnox. When Allegheny City became part of the city of Pittsburgh on December 6, 1907 the patients of Claremont were transferred to Marshalsea.
By 1900, the hospital's reputation as a place of sorrow was firmly established. The Home Monthly, a publication of the time, described the inmates at Marshalsea as ""Poor wrecks of humanity they are -- some mental, some physical, some moral wrecks -- stranded, at last dependent upon the city for enough to keep a miserable broken body and a poor shrunken soul together. ... If there is to-day a discontented man or woman in this city I prescribe a trip to Marshalsea. The blood may flee from the face at times and pity clutch at the heart strings."" Years later, a contest was held to find a more suitable name for the hospital. There were four finalists, the winner was Mayview. By 1916, the State Legislature gave its consent to change the name of the hospital from Marshalsea to the Pittsburgh City Home and Hospital at Mayview.
In accordance with an act of 1938 that required the state to take over all institutions for the care of the mentally ill, the State of Pennsylvania took control of the mental section of the hospital in 1941. The patient population reached a high point of 3,785 in June of 1967, with 1,200 staff and employees. In March 1973, the Department of Public Welfare made plans to move patients judged to be criminally insane from Farview State Hospital to Mayview. In 1982, an adolescent center was transferred from Woodville State Hospital to Mayview. During the closing of Dixmont State Hospital in 1984, the deaf unit was transferred to Mayview.
The patient population gradually reduced starting in the 1970s, by 2008 the hospital only had 354 patients with 800 staff and employees. The hospital provided services to Allegheny, Beaver, Greene, Lawrence and Washington Counties. In addition, a forensic division of the hospital provides services to clients from the entire region west of Harrisburg. Mayview State Hospital was closed by the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare in December of 2008. The remaining patients were individually assessed and were either transferred to another state hospital or to community care facilities.
A series of deaths and other serious incidents (known by the state as ""sentinel events"") started to occur after the closure of the hospital was announced in 2007. In the space of 24 hours in October 2007, two former Mayview patients died violently. Anthony Fallert, who had been released from the hospital in Spring of 2006, wandered from a South Side residence operated by Mercy Behavioral Mental Health. His body was found a day later in the Monongahela River. Authorities believe he had leapt or fallen from the Birmingham Bridge after leaving the facility. In the year after his release from Mayview, Mr. Fallert had lived at facilities in Clarion County and New Kensington and with his mother in Allentown. The day Mr. Fallert's body was being pulled from the river, another former Mayview patient, Ahson J. Abdullah, was struck by a train as he walked on the tracks near his home in Braddock. Mr. Abdullah, who had been in and out of jail over the course of his life, had been a patient at Mayview's forensic unit, which handles mental health cases referred by the courts. In all, state officials say 44 sentinel events have taken place among the region's mentally ill and critics suggest it could run higher. At the same time, the Department of Public Welfare says that of the 44 events cited, only three involved patients released from Mayview since the closure was announced Aug. 15 of 2007 and only 10 of the 44 cases had any prior history with Mayview.
In 2010, the campus was purchased by Aloe Brothers LLC and by early 2013, nearly all the buildings had been demolished. A new residential development now sits on the former site of the hospital as of August 2018.

Pennsylvania,Woodville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Allegheny_County_Almshouse,1939 (As a PA State Hospital),,1854,Demolished,Cottage Plan,Howard Sterling & Thomas B. Garman,Allegheny County Almshouse | Allegheny Hospital for the Insane | Allegheny County Home for the Poor,"Originally founded as the Allegheny County Home for the Poor in 1854, the hospital was owned and operated by the county government until May 31, 1939 when it was taken over by the state of Pennsylvania along with 11 other county owned mental hospitals.[1] When the state took control of the hospital the Allegheny County Institutional District continued to manage the ""poor"" section of this facility. This arrangement continued until 1958 when the state assumed complete control of all administrative duties. In 1983 the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare proposed closing the hospital, but instead closed the much smaller Dixmont State Hospital in 1984. The hospital was finally closed by the state in 1992. At the time of it's closing the hospital still cared for 460 patients. Each patient was evaluated and either sent to Mayview State Hospital or were put into community care programs.[2] Soon after the closing many of the hospital buildings were torn down as land was divided up and sold. PennDot was the first to build on the former hospital property. Their new 4 million dollar District 11 Headquarters, built on the front lawn of the hospital, was completed the same year the hospital closed.[3] PennDot received scrutiny for spending money on a new building rather than using hospital buildings for it's new headquarters.[4] Former hospital land is also home to a school, shopping mall, and residential developments. As of 2009 the only remnant of the hospital is the power plant smoke stack.
The cemetery remains in a wooded area of the property. A memorial, erected in 1987, stands at the entrance to the cemetery, showing the dates of the cemetery as 1867-1949. The graves do not have names, but are numbered with markers approximately 10"" tall, in neat rows in numerical order. We found up to 692 graves numbered this way. The Pennsylvania State Archives holds 1920 diagram of burial plot locations of deceased patients in the cemetery of the Allegheny County Home for the Insane and Tuberculosis Sanitarium, including first and last name of patients. One hundred and ninety-six burial plots are labeled with their plot number and the name of the person buried there. Additionally, the Collier Township webpage has gathered a list of graveyard numbers, patient name and number, and location on the 1920 census. One grave also has the tombstone of John Nayder - 1868-1932. One additional marker contains initials only of TNDW and CH. All of the photos were taken in March 2008.[5] [6] [7]

Pennsylvania,Beaver County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Beaver_County_Almshouse,1851,1853,1853,Active,"Neo-classical (1916 buildings), 1950s institutional",,Beaver County Poor Farm  |  Beaver County Home |  Beaver County Home and Farm  |  Beaver County Home and Hospital (1940-1958) |  Beaver County Geriatric Center (1959-1974) |  Beaver Valley Geriatric Center (1975-1993) |  Friendship Ridge (1993-2017) | Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center (Current),"The decision to create a poorhouse in Beaver County has its roots in a 1831 Court-House debate, which was unsuccessful in persuading the establishment of such an institution. The topic returned 10 years later only to be defeated in a vote. In another 10 years, in 1851 the issue was yet again placed to a vote, only narrowly passing with a vote of 1,855 to 1,738. As a result the county purchased a farm from George Stone for $6,900 and erected a small one story frame building in what was then Moon Township. It sat on 130 acres of land, with 5 being cultivated and 1 used as a garden. In 1859 another one story frame building was erected on the same site. It was not until 1868 when a more substantial two story brick almshouse was constructed to replace the two older structures. This building was completed in 1870. Due to the low location of the site by the Ohio River the alsmhouse property experienced frequent flooding, on February 7th 1884 having water rise seven feet above the ground level.By 1885 the poor farm could accommodate 100 paupers.
A state report from 1913 indicated the 1870 era building was in very poor condition and cited constant flooding as a problem, and that plans were being drawn up to build a new facility on the same property, but in a location which would no flood. In 1916 this institution opened up a substantial distance from the original almhouse site. It consisted of a central building with two story wings on either side, attached by one story connecting corridors. Designed with in the neo-classical style of architecture the central building sported a large pillared porch. In 1940 a large addition was built to the rear of the 1916 building which added an additional 100 beds. The complex also included the superintendents residence, a morgue, and various farm outbuilding. Unusual was the provision for several jail cells for those paupers who misbehaved.
By the late 1950s the poor house had turned its focus more towards the old and infirm rather than the poor and insane of old. Overcrowding became a problem and in 1956 the infirm were moved into the former Beaver County TB sanatorium in Center Township, which was later donated to become the administration building at Penn State-Beaver. On March 13, 1959 a new five story building was opened up in Beaver, PA, the remaining 220 patients at the Potter Township location moved in the following month. In 1964 when the new east wing was opened the infirm patients were transferred from the former Sanitarium in Brighton. For a brief period from 1975-1978 the county privatized the nursing home under a public board to take advantage of state reimbursements. During this period an annex to the original building, now called west wing, was built in 1976 by this county, increasing the total beds to 676. It was at this time of privatization what the name was changed to the Beaver Valley Geriatric Center, which was retained when it returned to county ownership in 1978.
In 1993 $10 million in renovations were approved for the facility and the name was changed to Friendship Ridge, which is what it is currently know by. It currently provides inpatient and outpatient services for seniors. The old 1916 building and 1940 addition are still standing and in use by the Zinc Corporation as offices.

Pennsylvania,Berks County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Berks_County_Almshouse,,,1824,"Demolished (Original Campus), Active","Single Building,",,Berks County Poor House | Berks Heim,"The Berks County Almshouse was located on Lancaster Pike 3 miles from Reading. As of the 1885 Report by the Board of Charities the hospital complex was made up of 6 primary buildings and a number of smaller buildings for minor uses such as the creamery, bakery and slaughterhouse. The almshouse sat on 514 acres of land, of which 434 was under cultivation with crops for the institution and 5 under garden husbandry. The complex housed an almshouse, hospital for the infirm, as well as an insane department.
The almshouse was established in 1824 when the original building was constructed. In 1831 the male and female departments for the insane and the male hospital were erected. The female hospital was erected the following your in 1832. In 1858 a new wash house was built and steam heat was introduced to the institution. The old was house was then converted for use by the insane female patients. As was typical of early almshouses these buildings were generally simple two and three story square structures.
In 1874 a new and modern hospital was constructed for the infirm, sick, disabled, and feeble-minded. The building measured 277 feet by 60 feet and stood at three stories with an attic and basement. The male and female patients were segregated on either side of the buildings main wing. The each floor of the building contained spacious rooms designed to be occupied by two patients, 10 foot wide hallways, and water closets. The central wing, which extended to the buildings rear contained the kitchen and dining hall on the first floor and the chapel on the second.
The complex maintained an independent insane department, which by 1885 was housed in the two brick buildings which formerly served as the male and female hospitals. The capacity of these structures is 58 males and 28 females, for a total capacity of 86. In the report it was noted that the facilities for the insane were not appropriate and the insane patients would be better served by a transfer to Harrisburg State Hospital or Danville State Hospital.
As time went on the hospital became more focused on the infirm and aged than the poor and insane, as many almshouses did by the middle of the 20th century. In 1952 the complex on Lancaster Ave closed for good, being replaced with a new infirmary in Leesport called Berks Heim. Berks Heim remains in operation today as a county run nursing home. In 1957 the old almshouse complex was demolished and replaced with apartment housing, a shopping center, and the Governor Mifflin School.
Like many almshouses the Berks County Almshouse maintained the county potters field. The exact location of which however appears to be lost.

Amsden (brick structure),Blakely Home and Hospital |  Blakely Convalescent Home |  Blakely Home For The Insane,"In Pennsylvania the almshouse typically consisted of a single County Poor Farm which provided refuge for all paupers of said county. Lackawanna, and a few other counties, acted as an exception to this rule of administration and instead divided the county into separate poor districts, each with their own almshouse. Lackawanna County was divided into five separate poor-districts with five separate poor houses. These were the Blakely Poor-House, Carbondale City Poor-House, Hillside Farm and Almshouse, Northern Luzerne Poor-House, and the Ransom Poor-House, which incorporated in its poor district three townships and four boroughs of Luzerne County.
The Blakely Poor District was incorporated in 1861. The poor farm was located  six miles from Olyphant and its poor district included the boroughs of Archbald, Blakely, Dickson, Olyphant, Winton, and part of Jermyn. By 1886 the poor farm sat on 86 acres of land, bought for $7000, and had 40 acres under cultivated with one acre being used for garden husbandry. The institution originally had no plumbing, with toilet accommodations consisting of two cesspools located away from the buildings and water coming from a 14 foot well. At this time the poor farm consisted of two wooden frame structures, each two stories tall.
The first structure measured 30x40 feet and provided accommodation for the steward and his family. This building contained a small bedroom, parlor, hall, and sitting room on the first floor with four bedrooms, two large and two small, on the second floor. Attached to this buildings side was a ""wing"", measuring 30x24 feet which housed the female paupers. In this annex was the kitchen on the first floor with the second floor being divided into two congregate dormitories. This building could comfortably accommodate 24 female paupers.
The second structure was for the accommodation of male paupers, measuring 20x30 feet. The first floor contained a parlor and a congregate dormitory, with the second floor being divided into four bedrooms of various sizes. This building could comfortably accommodate 12 male paupers, bringing the total capacity of the institution to 36 paupers.
In 1890 the Blakely County Poor District began construction of a new brick and stone structure to replace the older frame structures. This building was two stories tall with an additional cellar and attic story. The structure as it stands today consists of the center brick building and two wings, one in either side, attached by hallways. It is possible that the center portion is the original 1890 structure and the wings on either side are later additions.
The alsmhouse operated in some capacity or another until the mid 1970s. From 1919 to 1950 it may have operated an insane dept however this information remains unsubstantiated* by reliable sources. At the time of its closure in the 1970s it was operating as a county convalescent home. In 1976 the county sold the property to a private owner.
Since the almshouses closure and subsequent sale in 1976 the building renovated for use as a clinical research lab. It currently stands and is owned by a company known as Calvert Laboratories Inc.

Built on what had been 150 acres of farmland. The original red brick building survives as the Old Administration Building, now home for the Pennsylvania National Guard's 28th Infantry Division Band.
On September 29, 1938 the state took control of the hospital as part of the ""Full State Care Act"". The legislature (Act #53) assumed responsibility for eight of the thirteen existing county public mental hospitals, the other five hospitals were closed. The facility was renamed to Hollidaysburg State Hospital in 1941. But it was not until after World War II that it began the expansion that resulted in the building of Rush Hall, Neil Hall, and Sommer Hall as the main housing and administration units of the complex. The grounds doubled in size, to 326 acres.
As the care of the mentally ill changed from custodial care to outpatient care, the patient population dwindled until a decision was made in the 1970s to shut it down.
The Department of Military Affairs was looking to expand its veterans homes system. At the time, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Erie, opened in 1886, was the only facility available. The decision to shut down Hollidaysburg was reversed and it was transferred to Military Affairs in September 1977. Five residents were admitted to the facility in June of that year on a pilot program.
Renovations to Neil Hall and Rush Hall were completed in 1982 at a cost of $2.8 million for Rush Hall and $3.9 million for Neil Hall. Rush Hall, built in 1953, is now the administration building and nursing care facility. It was renamed Eisenhower Hall after the five-star general and president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Neil Hall, built in 1949, was renamed MacArthur Hall after the former five-star general, Douglas MacArthur. It is now the domiciliary care building. On April 10, 1992, the old Sommer Hall, built in 1954, officially became Arnold Hall, named after the five-star general and native Pennsylvanian, Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, who is considered the father of the Air Force. That $10.2 million project completed the conversion of the former state hospital to a veterans home.

Pennsylvania,Blockley Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Blockley_Almshouse,,,1732,Closed,"1732-1832 Single Building, 1832-1977 Rambling Plan",William Strickland (1830s era buildings),Philadelphia Almshouse  | Philadelphia Almshouse & Hospital | Philadelphia Bettering House | Old Blockley | Philadelphia General Hospital,"With the Friend's Almshouse operating since 1713 the city put off construction of its own facilities until 1732, and the Philadelphia Almshouse was established. Occupying the entire block between Third and Fourth, Spruce and Pine Streets this was the first government funded poorhouse in the United States and was regarded as a model institution, it had separate facilities for the indigent and the insane, and also an infirmary. In 1767, the much larger almshouse with an infirmary, and the house of work were completed on the south side of Spruce Street between Tenth and Eleventh. This facility was used until around 1835.
By 1830, overcrowding necessitated further expansion, and a new almshouse for men and another for women, a separate hospital and a workhouse were built from 1827 to 1832. This included departments for children as well as a segregated department for African Americans This complex was built across the Schuylkill River in Blockley Township, in what is now University City in West Philadelphia. William Strickland was the architect and Samuel Sloan, later to be a well-known architect, worked as a journeyman carpenter on the project. This facility soon became known as ""Old Blockley"". Operated by a city committee known as the Guardians of the Poor, Blockley’s early reputation for care was dismal. In 1864, the ""Female Lunatic Asylum"" building was accidentally destroyed by workers installing heaters, killing 18 women and injuring another 20. Article on Fire By 1885 there had been four fires at the institution. Blockley's geographical isolation from city medical institutions limited clinical care until the University of Pennsylvania, with its medical school, moved to a new site just north of the Almshouse grounds in 1871.
Despite the huge size of the institution for its time, with the ability to accommodate about 3,000, by 1870 it was overcrowded with a population of 3,789. According to the 1878 Annual report of the Board of Commissioners of Public Charities Blockley's Insane department housed 1,200, accounting for a full quarter of all insane in the state. In order to address this overcrowding at Blockley the state built the State Asylum for the Insane at Norristown, opening in 1880 (See Norristown State Hospital). In 1884 the State Lunacy Commission ordered all insane in the state almshouses be transferred to their district's respective hospital. Despite this many insane remained at Blockley simply due to lack of accommodations at Norristown. In 1889 this was amended to allow for transfer of some classes of patients back to state almshouses.
As the latter 19th century saw advancements in both medicine and psychiatry, Blockley’s mission gradually embraced that of a more conventional public hospital. A nursing school was opened at the site 1885 under the direction of Alice Fisher, replacing ad hoc patient nurses with a system of skilled nursing. In 1903, operations of the hospital were turned over to the newly created Bureau of Hospitals in the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. In 1906, the insane were moved to the Byberry Mental Hospital, later known as the Philadelphia State Hospital.
""Old Blockley"" was renamed Philadelphia General Hospital (PGH) in 1919. During the next few decades, the original almshouse buildings were gradually replaced with modern facilities. By the 1950’s the site contained the city’s public hospital, as well as a nursing home and a home for the indigent.
In 1952, the new City Home Rule Charter placed the control of the Philadelphia General Hospital with a Board of Trustees. Under contracts signed in 1959, care at PGH was carried out by the medical schools of Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania who subcontracted work to Jefferson Medical College, Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann Medical School.
By the early 1970s, public support including Medicaid allowed private hospitals to expand treatment for the poor. Facing both financial difficulties as well as a stock of aging buildings, the board of PGH closed the hospital entirely in 1977.
The Almshouse was built by the city in what was then known as Blockley Township, on land purchased from the Andrew Hamilton estate. This parcel of land stretched from what are now known as Civic Center Blvd to Guardian Drive and from University Ave to 34th Street. A blue historical marker was erected on Curie Blvd, formerly Almshouse Lane. commemorating the significance of the site.
Today the site is occupied by parts of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Health System and the Veterans Health Administration and represents a major center of medical research and care in Philadelphia. A long brick wall topped by an ornately decorated iron fence that dates back to Almshouse still forms part of the southern and western boundaries of the site.
The hospital maintained a large potters field on the property adjoining it. This field latter fell into disuse as a cemetery and in later years eventually built over anf forgotten. In 2001, more than 1,000 bodies associated with the Almshouse were recovered from an adjacent construction site and reburied in the nearby Woodlands Cemetery.

Building construction was completed the following year at a total cost of $38,500. The building was constructed of clay bricks, made of clay from the land on which it stood.
The first “inmates” were received in 1881. “Inmates” earned their keep by performing many chores, including household duties and tending to the 94 cows, 400 chickens, 46 hogs, and 96 turkeys. They also planted and maintained large gardens, canning upwards of 5,000 quarts of fruits and vegetables annually. The County Farm housed anywhere from 100-130 people on a normal basis.
In 1938, the house burned. Reconstructed in 1940 and renamed the Bradford County Home, the new building was opened in 1941 to care for 170 patients. It was later converted into an infirmary, and in 1963, renamed the Bradford County Manor with the addition of a west wing. The east wing was added in 1964, and in 1985, major renovations were completed and two new wings added. Cosmetic upgrades and remodels were made over the years, including a state of the art rehabilitation therapy gym, and eventually into what it is today-the Bradford County Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center.
Today the Bradford County Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, nestled in the mountains of Northeastern Pennsylvania, is a 200-bed facility offering both private and semi-private rooms, 21 private short term stay rehabilitation suites and a secure memory impairment neighborhood.",,"Burlington, PA",,
Pennsylvania,Bucks County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bucks_County_Almshouse,"April 10, 1807","June 27, 1904",1810,Closed,Single Building,,,"In the legislature of 1806—1807 Bucks County was represented by friends of the measure, and on April 10, 1807, an act was passed authorizing the erection of a county almshouse. The commissioners of Bucks, with the consent of the court of quarter sessions and the grand jury, were empowered to act. After determining upon the erection of an almshouse, they were directed to authorize an election of seven citizens, to fix upon a site for the purpose, and also an election of three persons to be directors of the poor, who should divide themselves into three classes with reference to their term of office. They were to appoint a treasurer, employ and dismiss at pleasure a steward, matron, physician, surgeon, and any other necessary attendants; to indenture apprentices till the time at which they should become of age, and exercise all such powers as had previously been vested in the overseers of the poor. Hilltown, New Britain, Plumstead, and all townships below, were named in the bill; the others were exempted from its provisions, but authorized to share in them by paying their share of the cost of the house and farm. The matter passed the several stages prescribed, and in October, 1807, the election was held, resulting in the choice of Thomas Long, William Buckman, David Spinner, William Watts, Thomas Stewart, Joseph Clunn, and Samuel Gillingham to fix upon a site, and James Chapman, John McMasters, and Ralph Stover as directors.
The election was closely contested by a strong element opposed to the measure in itself and to its ultimate bearing upon the change of the county-seat, and after the election every possible effort was made to prevent the purchase of a site. After a delay of fourteen months, however, the commissioners for the location made choice of the Gilbert Rodman tract of three hundred and sixty acres, situated in Warwick, on the Easton road and the Neshaminy creek, which was purchased at twenty pounds per acre. The selection and purchase were severely criticized, and public meetings were called to support or condemn it, but the court’s approval of the purchase ended the contest, though the animosities engendered lived long afterward.
Measures for the erection of the building were at once taken. The counties of Lancaster, Chester, and Delaware had erected similar institutions, and McMasters and Chapman were dispatched to these counties to glean such information as would be useful in the construction of the proposed building. They made a report on January 15, 1808, and on the following day the proposals of mechanics were received. From the 25th to the 31st instant the board was in continuous session engaged in preparing estimates and plans, and the contract was finally awarded to Timothy Smith. Chapman and Smith then visited Delaware county to examine the almshouse there and secure plans. The stone was quarried upon the farm, and the men were stimulated to their best endeavor by a half-barrel of whiskey placed at their disposal by the directors. On the 21st of June the directors went to New hope and purchased lumber of Hugh Smith. Shingles were bought of Henry Bell, of Philadelphia, and lime of Tyson Hill, and Samuel Gilbert. Building operations began on the 4th of May, 1809, when the corner-stone was laid. The character of the ceremonies is not known, but they doubtless were of a hilarious order, as the directors and two other equally benevolent gentlemen furnished the liquor at their private expense. In fact, whiskey entered very largely into the expense of construction, eight hundred and twenty-two gallons of it being consumed by the workmen in the course of the building’s erection. About one-fourth of this amount is itemized as whiskey, at a cost of $94.77 1/2, the rest being conveniently included in the general item of ""diet."" The aggregate cost of the building was $19,030.47 1/2, to which the sum of $19,280 paid for the farm should be added, bringing the total to $38,310.47 1/2. It was occupied on March 20, 1810, twenty-four townships contributing one hundred and thirty-nine inmates. The rest of the townships subsequently availed themselves of the privileges of the act, and all now approve the wisdom of a measure many once opposed. The almshouse is a stone structure with two stories and an attic, and stands upon an eminence which overlooks a wide scope of surrounding country, insuring good air and the best facilities for drainage. The experience of some three-quarters of a century has confirmed the claims originally made in defense of the selection, save in the matter of the water supply. A hydraulic ram was at first constructed to convey water from the small tributary of the Neshaminy to the buildings. This was found inadequate, and a number of wells were dug. In 1875 a severe drouth affected the water supply of the whole county, and a steam pump and a reservoir, with a capacity of twenty-seven hundred barrels, were constructed by the steward, at a cost of four or five thousand dollars. In 1881 an artesian well was sunk, and the stream abandoned as a source of supply for the buildings. The well has proven practically successful, and the water is forced from thence by a steam pump to all parts of the buildings.
The sick and insane here have always been cared for in a separate building provided for them. The old Rodman farm-house was converted into a hospital, with a stone building furnished with cells for the worst cases of insanity. Many of these, however, were subsequently transferred to the state institutions. A new stone hospital, in many respects patterned after a similar institution in Lancaster county, was erected in 1868—9. It is a massive stone structure, forty-five by one hundred and twenty feet in superficial dimensions, four stories high, and contains sixty rooms. It is provided with solid brick partition walls throughout; with water and heating appliances, offices, kitchens, etc., of the most approved kind. The entire cost is estimated at S144,001.70. In 1849 the cholera reached Bucks county, and in July made its appearance at the alms-house with unusual virulence. In less than a week eighteen cases had proven fatal, and a dozen inmates were complaining with premonitory symptoms of the dread disease. Naturally it was difficult to find any brave enough to face this danger, and render such help as was needed. Before the close of the second week eighty of the one hundred and fifty-four occupants had perished. Medical aid was then secured, and several gentlemen of the vicinity volunteered their services. William Edwards, the steward, and his wife, both died in the discharge of their duties, and the senior physician, Dr. O.P. James, declared that nothing but the imperious demands of duty sustained him in the terrible experiences of that time. But one of the directors, William B. Warford, ventured to visit the plague-stricken spot, and when he arrived more than forty were dead or dying. The fear of contagion for a time stifled every humane sentiment, and the unburied bodies were necessarily permitted for too long a time to add their poisonous contribution to the already heavily freighted air. No great degree of censure is due for this state of things. In the presence of such danger the simple performance of duty rises to the height of heroism, and all cannot act the heroic part. The general administration of this institution has been creditable throughout its history. In 1819, when the ill-feeling engendered by the erection of the almshouse, and the removal of the county-seat was still active, a widespread disposition to criticize the management of the public charity was developed. On May 22d a meeting was held in the court house to discuss the matter. The meeting was practically unanimous in its condemnation of the administration, and a committee was appointed to examine the condition and the methods employed in conducting the institution. The result of the committee’s exploration was rather inconclusive; in their report they criticized the methods employed, but brought no charge of culpable neglect or incompetency. In 1877 a commission was appointed to inquire into the condition and conduct of the institution. They reported much to the credit of the management, so far as the conduct of the steward and his assistants were concerned, but seriously reflected upon the financial policy of the directors. Many practices that had come into use were condemned as irregular and extravagant, and calling for immediate reform. The effect of this examination and report was to bring about a radical change in this respect, and it is believed that the institution is now conducted as efficiently as any similar one in the state. In the support of this charity the county has expended fully a million dollars during the three-quarters of a century that it has existed. Its present available assets may be estimated at two hundred thousand dollars, and the balance of this large expenditure must be accredited to the noble satisfaction of having established and generously dispensed a great public charity.
The Bucks County Almshouse was in operation from 1810-1966 when it became Neshaminy Manor, a county nursing home. The Manor moved into nearby new digs in 1999, but several of the old buildings remain. Almshouse Road in Bucks County, PA is named for the old Almshouse.",1966,,,

Pennsylvania,Embreeville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chester_County_Almshouse,"Sept 29, 1938 (As a PA State Hospital)",1898,1938,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Embreeville Complex | Chester County Poor House  | Chester County Almshouse,"This facility started out as the Chester County Almshouse in 1798, and was intended to care for the insane, poor, and neglected of the county. The commonwealth would later want counties to construct independent facilities that could provide care for the indigent insane and, beginning in 1898, work began on land where the ""new"" poorhouse would be located. The facility developed into a working community where able-bodied people earned their keep by performing a variety of tasks from farming to sewing, laundry and related chores. This new site would accommodate the growing need of the destitute in the region. Not far from the original poorhouse was a Potter’s Field, where less fortunate people without a family or means of support were buried. By 1900, patients from Norristown State Hospital were relocated to the new Embreeville asylum, which was functioning as a semi-autonmous hospital. Over time, additional modern buildings were constructed to house a growing mentally ill population. It was officially acquired by the state from Chester County in 1914.
On September 29, 1938 the commonwealth took total control of the facility as part of their new state-wide legislation, known as the ""Full State Care Act"". The legislature (Act #53) assumed responsibility for eight of the thirteen existing county public mental hospitals, the other five hospitals were closed. This same piece of legislation would transform sites like Philadelphia City Farms into Philadelphia State Hospital. It was designated that Embreeville would serve Lancaster and Chester County in Pennsylvania as part of their catchment area. Embreeville was cited by the American Psychiatric Association as one of three ""model hospitals"" in the country. Dr. Arthur Hecker, the hospital superintendent, upon hearing this honor stated ""We're naturally quite proud to be so honored by our peers... but we're even more pleased about a fact that helped make it possible. We have 100 percent turnover of beds each year.""
In 1971, a juvenile detention center was place within a few buildings at the hospital site, before finally moving on to better physical accommodations in Danville in 1992. By 1979, the total statewide state hospital census was reduced to 10,573 patients, and resulted in the closure of several smaller state hospitals. Embreeville was the second state facility in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to close its doors, in 1980, following that of Hollidaysburg State Hospital.
In the wake of its closure, outpatient clinics were established through Fellowship Human Resources in Phoenixville, PA (BSU# 151), Human Services Inc. in Downingtown, PA (BSU# 152), and Creative Health Services in Spring City, PA (BSU# 153). These clinics are largely county funded, and are intended to treatment the mentally ill on an outpatient basis, in lieu of the former regional state hospital.
For the better part of the three decades the site of Embreeville stood abandoned, the physical site slowly deteriorating because of the commonwealth's neglect. The area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and as of December 2012, Hellings Holdings LLC was awarded the 225-acre former  hospital property for an asking price of $950,000. According to the developer plans for the land include residential development with some commercial zoning. However, because of the property’s location, commercial development plans call for certain necessary amenities which have yet to be established.
The potter's field (now part of the Cheslen Preserve and clearly noted on hiking trails), where impoverished patients were buried, is outside of the hospital grounds and has a sign marked by the local government. The wooden sign there on the site bears the inscription ""Known but to God, respected by us"", in clear reference to the anonymity of the graves on-site. Two-hundred and four lonely charcoal grey stone tablets remain there in the field, honoring the lives of the forgotten poor, which left this life unknown to the rest of humanity.

The facility was established by the Act of May 4, 1854 and situated approximately two miles north of Danville in a rural area. The hospital sat on 116 acres of land, of which 111 were cultivated and one was utilized for garden husbandry. All of this was done for the benefit of the institution.
The original construction consisted of two wood frame buildings, with the main building measuring 30 by 40 feet, with a wing of 25 by 16 feet, and standing two stories tall with an attic. This building with nine rooms on the ground floor and ten on the second, accommodated both the steward and the female paupers. The second building, being built for males, was also two stories high and measured 20 by 40 feet. At the time of an 1885 report by the Pennsylvania Board of Public Charities more structures had been added. In 1873 a large barn and carriage shed had been erected which were noted to provide ample space for livestock. A third two story building was also on the premise and used to relieve overcrowding though was not yet finished.
According to the previously mentioned 1885 it was noted that there were 35 paupers, with all the insane being sent to the nearby Danville State Hospital. The report indicated the facilities, aside from the barn, were reported to be inadequate and the construction of a modern, brick, county almshouse was recommended. The county system was not adopted, however a 1902 report shows that the old wooden frame buildings had been replaced by two modern brick buildings.
Recent history is fuzzy, though it is extremely likely this institution closed by the 1970s.
According to the Montour County Genealogical Society the former poor house farm currently is located in Danville, PA on
Route 11 across from Woodbine Lane. The land is now called Memorial Park containing no marked graves. A memorial marker exists on site.

Pennsylvania,Delaware County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Delaware_County_Almshouse,"February 13, 1804",1804,"1804 (original site), May 1856 (Second site)",Active,,John Eves & Company,*Delaware County Home | Delaware County Poor Farm | Delaware County House of Employment | Fair Acres Farm | Fair Acres Geriatric Center,"The Delware County Almshouse was established on Freburary 13th, 1804 in order to provide a house of support and employment for the poor of Delaware county. That same year a site was chosen adjoining the present town of Media. The farm initially consisted of 137 acres purchased for $33 each; later another 21 acres were purchased at $100 an acre bringing the farms total size to 158 acres. When the poor house was finally completed and ready for occupancy all the poor of the county were sent there. Prior to this the counties poor were boarded for in various Townships in private homes under the charge of two Overseers of the Poor per Township. This original poor house was a stone structure measuring 100x40 feet. The poor continued to be cared for at this location for fifty years.
In 1848 the decision was made to move the Delaware County seat from the City of Chester to a move central location. The location chosen was what today is Media Pennsylvania, which remains the seat of the county. In accordance with this the Board of Commissioners soon purchased 48 acres from Sarah Brigs for $5760, located adjacent to the poor farm property. The property was then sold in plots imminently at an enormous profit. The creation of public buildings and a town greatly increased land values and soon the idea of removing the County Almshouse to another location was suggested. This was for the best as the current structure was found not to be optimal for its duty and allowed for a large and modern farm to be constructed while producing profit for the County. An act of May 8, 1854 authorized the sale of the poor farm property which was sold to Media in two tracts, first a 48 acre tract at $250 an acre, and the final 112 acres at 341.50 per acre.
From the 50,000 profit from the sale of the old property the Board of Directors purchased 103 acres from the farm of Abraham Pennell near Lima, PA. The new poor farm buildings were built between 1856 and 1857 by John Eves & Company, opening in May of 1857. The main measured 91 by 27 feet and consisted of a three story high stone structure with a cemented front. As usual male and female paupers were separated by wing, with a separate hospital room being set aside for each. In the center read of the building was the kitchen. It was heated by stoves and did have water closets at the time of construction. It was made to accommodate 130 people.
In 1863 a separate building for the insane was constructed to the rear of the almshouse. This building was 45.5x33.5 feet in diameter, made of stone and two stories high with a basement story below. The basement was used for storage while the other two were used for female insane paupers as well as housing for the attendant. In 1873 an identical addition was added to the insane building to accomidate the male insane of the county. The building could now hold 20 of each sex, which proved to be inadequate according to the 1885 State Report.
The almshouse continued to grow and with the advent of increased State care of the insane and mentally disabled with the increased welfare programs for the poor the farm began to shift towards care for the elderly and infirm. In 1967 the farming operations were discontinued, marking its true transition from a partially residential facility to a long term care facility for the counties elderly. In 1978 ""Farm"" was dropped from the name and it became the Fair Acres Geriatric Center.
Today the facility sits on 210 acres and comprised 18 buildings including a large 13 story tower. Five of these buildings are for residents and can accommodate up to 900 people. The original buildings on this site were demolished sometime after 1951, it is unclear when this took place. The original farmhouse on the property, the Odgen-Pennell House, however, dating back to the early 1700s remains.
Fair Acres Geriatric Center is located in Lima, Pennsylvania on Pa. Route 352, one mile north of U.S. Route 1 and Granite Run Mall.
It is uncertain if the second site contains a potters field for the counties indigent and those who passed at the County Home. The county did do burials of poor deceased at public expense at a couple of cemeteries in the county, but it is likely the county did maintain a Potters Field at Fair Acres.
Per the Delaware County Medical Examiners office, there is a Potters Field at the Fair Acres location, and was still being used up to the 1980's.

Pennsylvania,Erie County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Erie_County_Almshouse,,,1871,"Demolished (Original Building), Active","Single Building,",,Erie County Home,"The Erie County Almshouse was established in 1841 and built three and a half miles west of the city of Erie. It stood in the vicinity of 23rd and Pittsburgh Avenue in what is now Millcreek Township. The building stood four stories tall, measuring 190 by 57 ft, with a rear wing of three stories extending off the rear measuring 84 by 32.5 ft. The building was constructed of brick and featured three towers, one at the center and one on either end of the building. The building was built to accommodation a population of 270 poor, 135 of each sex. In 1840 the building cost to the county was $1,065.00, which was levied from taxes
According to the 1885 State Report building center contained the apartment for the Steward and his family, separating the East and West wings of the building which contained the male and female paupers respectively. The first floor of the two wings each contained a sitting/smoking room, a large hall, and a store room. The second, third, and fourth floors contained the paupers rooms as well as water closets and bathrooms. In the rear wing the basement contained the heating and machine equipment for the hospital while the first floor contained the kitchen, dining room, and pantries. The second floor contained additional rooms for female patients and the third floor was utilized as a hospital for the male patients.
Fifty feet from the main hospital building was located small two story brick building which formerly housed the male insane of the institution. By 1885 the male insane of the county had all been transferred to Warren State Hospital. The 14 female insane housed at the time of the report were housed in the main building, likely the second floor of the rear wing, and considered incurable.
The hospital sat on 105 acres of land which was given to it by the state. All the land was under cultivation, with six being set aside for garden husbandry. The crops grown were wheat, barely, corn, and various vegetables which were all used to feed the inmates of the institution. An exercise yard was available at all times to the resident paupers.
At some point around 1918 the Original Almshouse complex was abandoned when a new one was opened in Girard PA. This building remains to this day, however is now in use as a private nursing home.
The Almshouse maintained a cemetery located on its grounds where the indigent dead as well as the unidentified from the county were buried beginning in the mid 1800s. This cemetery was used until December 2, 1920, when a 72 year old man became the 690th, and final soul to be laid to rest at the Pittsburgh Ave. location. At this time, burials were moved to the new county potters' field in Fairview township at Dobler Farm. Over time this cemetery grew to hold the remains of over 1000 unknown and unclaimed dead of Erie County. As happens all too often, the old potters' field located on Pittsburgh Ave. was forgotten, only being rediscovered in 1977 when a newpaper discovered it on a map of a  proposed industrial park for the site. The remains of 443 of the dead where exhumed and moved to the Dobler Farm Potters' field, where they were interred in seven vaults and given proper religious ceremony. The remaining 247 remain at the original site to this day, buried under roads, houses, and utility lines. A 1991 news story brought attention to the neglected County Potters' Field and public support for its maintenance. As a result, in 1994 the cemetery was rededicated, adding a memorial plaque and a history of the cemetery. The plaque reads: On This Memorial Weekend

Pennsylvania,Greene County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Greene_County_Almshouse,1859,,1862,Preserved,Single Building,,Greene County Poorhouse | Greene County Historical Society Museum (Current),"In 1861, the county of Greene acquired a large farm in western Franklin Township upon which stood a 12-room farmhouse built in 1857 by the Rinehart family. The structure was a large Georgian Revival with a center hall and finely decorated rooms, an extravagant home for the time. This home and farm was to be the site of the Greene County poorhouse. It didn’t take long for construction of a new wing to begin. The original house was used as a residence for the steward of the poorhouse, and the new two story wing, expanding straight out of the rear elevation of the house contained a long hallway with ten rooms running along the hall on the first floor, and an identical configuration on the second. Early in 1862, the county approved measures to install a new public roadway that would run in front of the facility. This roadway became Rt. 21, later be known as Old 21, and is now Rolling Meadows Road.
Issac Pipes was the first inmate to live in the facility, having been admitted on the 2nd of June 1862. Pipes was 40 years old, and formerly resided in Franklin Township. The records indicate that he had never held a job or an occupation of any sort, and his reason for admission was “crippled”. In 1881, a lengthy article written by a Mr. Ourt about poorhouses and almshouses from across the country was featured in Atlantic Monthly criticizing the living conditions of the Greene County poorhouse, and that prompted construction of a new wing in 1886. The new wing contained twelve new dorm rooms and a bathroom facility on each floor, and a basement of a similar layout. When the new wing was constructed, the 1861 wing was reconfigured, and five of the rooms on the first floor were converted to a large dining facility. This brought the total number of dorm rooms in the building to 38, for a total of 50 rooms in the facility, including the rooms in the steward’s home.
During this time period a new steward came to the facility: William B. Cage, by many accounts a cruel and sadistic man. The Waynesburg Republican published several articles about him in the late 1880’s and early 1890’s. A very concise report appeared in 1890 that detailed many of his inhumane treatments. He was known to use the food set aside for the residents to throw lavish parties in the “front of the house” – or the stewards residence – while leaving only scraps and leftovers for the inmates, he was accused of chaining individuals up in the basement rooms of the newest wing and allowing them to starve as punishment for minor infractions, and forcing the residents to bath in the creek behind the poorhouse in the icy cold winter months. He was known to have a cane with which he commonly beat the residents. It was even reported that Cage staffed the kitchen with a head cook who was blind, and that as a result the food consumed by the inmates was generally undercooked, and filled with flies.
The 1900’s brought a renewed sense of peace and happiness to the poorhouse and with the removal of Cage, new stewards were hired and living conditions improved. There are letters archived from inmates who were transferred to other institutions throughout the state, begging to return to the kind treatment they had grown accustomed to in the Greene County poorhouse, or as it was then called “The Green Hills Farm.” In the early 1960’s the old poorfarm had morphed into a retirement home for the aged of the Community; it was soon replaced by the Curry Home built across the road. The old house and grounds of the farm sat vacant for a few years before being taken on by the Greene County Historical Society in 1971, where they began to operate a local history museum that is still in existence.",1967,"Waynesburg, PA",,

As the years passed, the mentally ill were also provided care at the facility. At a later date, the responsibility for the operation of the poor farm was assumed by the City of Scranton, the Borough of Dunmore, and eventually, Lackawanna County. On September 29, 1938 the state took control of the hospital as part of the ""Full State Care Act"". The legislature (Act #53) assumed responsibility for eight of the thirteen existing county public mental hospitals, the other five hospitals were closed.
By the early 1940's, the Hillside Home and Hillside Hospital were operational in buildings currently named Abington Hall and Newton Hall. The name was changed from Hillside Home and Hospital to Clarks Summit State Hospital on October 1, 1943, when the Department of Public Welfare, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, assumed the responsibility to operate and manage state mental hospitals.
By the mid 1950's Clarks Summit State Hospital was serving the residents of Lackawanna County and approximately 150 Luzerne County residents who were transferred in 1947 after the Ransom Home was destroyed by fire. The total hospital population at that time was 1,450 patients.
As newer types of psychotropic medications and other psychosocial rehabilitative approaches were found effective in the treatment of the mentally ill, the census of the hospital declined. The hospital was then assigned the responsibility for various other geographical areas in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Several new buildings were constructed: Hilltop East (originally a tuberculosis ward), Hilltop West (a geriatric building), a Recreation Hall, a Laundry Facility, and a Warehouse.
As the patient population declined, the hospital's Long Term Care Unit was closed in May 1998. Today the hospital has a bed capacity of 265, all of which are designated for adult psychiatric in-patient services.

Pennsylvania,Honesdale and Texas Poor-House,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Honesdale_and_Texas_Poor-House,1862,,1863/1917,Preserved,Single Building,,Wayne County Home,"In 1863 Texas Township and Honesdale Borough purchased a farm in Berlin Township and opened an almshouse for the areas' indigent and homeless. This red brick house was constructed on the property in 1917 to replace an eighty-to one hundred-year-old frame house It accommodated as many as twenty-four residents Everyone worked who was physically capable. Men assisted the caretaker on the 193 acre farm, and women helped the matron with housekeeping duties. In 1945 the Wayne County Commissioners purchased the property, and it became the Wayne County Home, but was better known among local residents as The Poor Farm. During the Depression, Herman Botens (caretaker from 1922 until his death in 1952) brought vegetables and meats raised on the farm to Honesdale and distributed them to poor families. With implementation of new governmental policies, the time came when there was no longer a need for The Poor Farm; therefore, it closed in the late 1960s The county began leasing the house. Since 1992 it has been used by Lourdesmont, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, as a community rehabilitation residence for local teenagers. There is a county cemetery located near the house where the indigent without family were buried.

Unlike most counties, which utilized a county almshouse system Armstrong county utilized a system of Poor Districts, which were responsible for the poor from a specific section of the county. Armstrong County had three poor districts and three poor houses as a result.
The Kittanning Poor House was erected sometime likely in the 1850s or 1860s, however a new building was constructed in 1885. This was a wood framed one story structure measured 125 feet long and 4 feet wide with a painted iron roof. The structure has a center which is partition off the the wings to either side, to allow segregation of the male and female paupers. Each wing was made to accommodate 20 people and the rooms were well furnished. The rear part of the buildings center housed the dining room as well as the kitchen for the patients. The center portion rose up two stories, with the second story being used for the superintendent and his family. The poor house was rather primitive compared to others but was a result of the much smaller population.
The institution stood on 56 acres of land, with 30 of those being under cultivation and 2 under garden husbandry. There were also other outbuildings on the property, such as a Barn. The water was provided for by two springs on the property. Once known as Armstrong County’s “poor farm,” the Armsdale building along Route 85 outside of Kittanning will be vacated as four agencies move into a new facility nearby the county courthouse in 2017.",,,,
Pennsylvania,Lancaster County Almshouse and Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lancaster_County_Almshouse_and_Asylum,,,1800,Closed,Single Building,,The Lancaster County Poor and House of Employment | Lancaster County Almshouse and Hospital,"Construction of the Lancaster County almshouse began in 1799. The exact date the almshouse opened for operation is unknown. This institution at its inception was expected to serve a multitude of functions in the community, but was primarily intended for the social control of the poor. In the eighteenth century, poverty and urban life were viewed as the primary causes of such social ills as crime, homelessness, immorality, and even mental illness. In discussing the almshouse movement in the Mid-Atlantic region Bourque states, communities constructed almshouses as part of a complex response to social problems, and almshouses were part of a wide spectrum of efforts to manage the poor.
Delinquent and dependent children, at least initially were housed in the Lancaster County almshouse. It appears unclear as to whether these children were admitted to the almshouse with their families because of poverty, or as individuals because of dependency or delinquency I and what role the Courts had, if any, in the admission process. County taxes provided the primary source of funding for the almshouse. The Lancaster County almshouse included a working farm and stone quarry, and the manufacture of household goods with the residents of the institution employed in these operations. These operations were intended to reduce institutional dependence on county taxes by providing a source of revenue through the sale of excess produce and commodities.
Overall, administration of the almshouse was entrusted to a steward/superintendent, with his wife serving as matron of the hospital. It was typical for husband and wife to have these two positions, as it was required that the steward and his family live at the almshouse. Other staff positions are not as clearly documented, but seem to have included attendants, nurses, and a storekeeper.[1]

In 1887 a new hospital was started and the old one razed, the new building being completed in February, 1889. The Home and Farm comprise about a dozen buildings. In 1937, the Poor District was abolished and the County Almshouse became known as the County Institutional District, under the direction of the county commissioners. A new facility called Cedar Haven was occupied with 244 residents and a substantial waiting list. In 1973, the new Skilled Care Wing was built with 160 beds.

Pennsylvania,Lehigh County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lehigh_County_Almshouse,1844,,1845,,Single Building,,Cedarbrook,"The story of Cedarbrook began in 1844, when the Lehigh County Commissioners declared the need for a working farm and home for those that were poor and/or elderly. At the time Lehigh County residents recognized a need to care for those that were unable to sustain themselves. The first home was constructed in 1845. The self-sustaining working farm component of the Cedarbrook property began to phase out in the 1930s, although some aspects of agriculture on the Cedarbrook property may have lasted into the 1950s. The mission of caring for the frail and those without financial resources continued.
The current Cedarbrook Allentown original wings have roots in the 1920s, with a subsequent addition, the “D-Wing” tower, completed in 1970. Fountain Hill Manor was purchased by Lehigh County in 1974, and was subsequently called “the Annex” and now is properly referred to as “Cedarbrook Fountain Hill.” Both campuses of Cedarbrook are licensed by the state under one license, and as such over the years both campuses have been referred to as Cedarbrook, sharing staff, contracts, equipment, technology, and services

One by one, counties across the state began to develop a system to care for their community members.  On March 22, 1850 the PA General Assembly approved Act 202.  This Act commissioned a panel of twenty-eight local individuals to determine upon and purchase real estate that they deemed necessary for the accommodation of the poor of Mercer County.  It also set forth that the purchase should be made prior to January of 1851.  With the passage of Act 202, the County began its function as a caregiver to area poor. Initial development of the alms home in Mercer County took place during the early 1850s.  The Directors of the Poor and of the House of Employment for the County of Mercer purchased the original site from Henry Moore in 1851.  Directors Enoch Perrine, Samuel Woods, and William F. Groves soon realized that the site was inconveniently located and in too poor of a condition to continue developing.  Although a building was started at the Moore property, construction was abandoned and the property was eventually sold.  A new location was found and in May of 1852, 83 acres were purchased for Mercer County from Thomas Pearson.  The site was developed and ready for residents in January of 1853.  Fourteen individuals were recorded as the first residents of the new establishment.
The property of the Home was assembled from various parcels that were purchased over a period of nearly 80 years  to form a contiguous 353.85-acre facility.  Located approximately one mile north of Mercer, the property reached from the Clarksville Road on the west to Route 19 on the east.  In May of 1866 40 additional acres west of the Pearson property were purchased from Charles and Anna Bagnall and Thomas and Sidonia Clucow.  Next, 83 acres west of the first two purchases were acquired by the from Margaret and Robert Buxton in March of 1880.  Acquisition continued with the purchase of 110 acres that lay east of the Pearson tract from John and Elizabeth McConnell in November of 1920.  The last 35.5 acres were purchased from J.C. and Lillian Moon in 1930 bringing the total acreage to 350-plus acres.
The Home property has been the foundation for several resident buildings.  Over the course of about 110 years, three buildings were constructed to accommodate the poor of Mercer County.  The first was completed and housed residents in 1853.  Next, ground was broken in 1880 for a new resident complex.  The architecture firm of Drum and Stein of Pittsburgh developed plans for the castle-like structure.  The building was constructed by contractor Simon Harrold of Beaver Falls for $110,000.  The facility was opened for use in 1883.  The final residential complex was completed in 1960.  This structure is still operational today as a skilled nursing center under the management of Avalon Springs.
Both the size and scope of the farm changed over Farm's history.  Buildings, acreage, and animals were amassed until the 1950s, which most likely was the peak of production and diversity at the farm.  Nevertheless, changing regulations foreshadowed the fate of agriculture operated under the influence of the county.  In the 1970s it became unlawful for patients of the home to work on the farm.  Also, federal meat inspection regulations began to require all slaughtering to meet the standards of a slaughter plant.  Thus, a Blue Ribbon Committee of agricultural leaders in the county, charged with reviewing the status of operations at the farm, determined that continuing to operate the farm was not economically sound.  Consequently, the county ceased actively farming the acres of the poor farm and sold its machinery and livestock at auction in January of 1973.  Over the next 14 years, area farmers rented the barns and cropland, however much of the pastureland became idle.  Finally, in 1987 the Austin Rains family began raising Angus beef cattle at the operation.
The landscape of the farm also changed over time.  Buildings were razed and land was divided.  In 1937, County Institution District Law abolished the office of county poor director and conveyed its powers and duties to the County Commissioners.  From the 1970s to the late 1990s over 179 acres of the poor farm were parceled off and sold.  Mercer County Career Center, Mercer County Cooperative Extension, and Yes Academy Youth Education Services occupy 139 of those acres that lay east of State Route 58.  The remaining 40 acres were sold to a private organization known as Avalon Springs.  Avalon Springs still uses the third resident structure that was completed at the poor farm in 1960 as a skilled nursing center.  From the 1960s to the late 1990s several buildings were removed from service at the County Home.  The three farm dwellings, dairy barn, pig barn, and most notably the castle-like residence building were razed.  The division of land and the demise of the structures forever changed the landscape of the poor farm in Mercer County. Today, the land situated between State Route 58 and Clarksville Road (Rt. 258) still functions largely as it did years ago.  Agriculture and elderly care are still the focus of these lands and facilities.  The final residence structure built by the county remains as a home to patients at Avalon Springs.

Despite this it was not until March 10th 1806 that the county first passed an act establishing the county poor farm and authorizing its construction. By the fall of 1807 the construction was completed and the farm was in operation. It was located in Upper Providence Township, two miles from Phoenixville. By 1885 the alsmhouse property extended 298 acres, of which 245 were under cultivation and four more under garden husbandry. In 1821 the originals almshouse building caught fire and burned down, but was rebuilt that same year. In 1867 a fire consumed many of the hospital's outbuildings, causing them to be rebuilt that summer. These buildings included the wagon-house, slaughter-house, sheep-stable, barn-yard wall, corn-crib and chicken-house.
In 1870 it was deemed the 1821 almshouse was not suitable for its purpose and construction of a few almshouse was begun. The new almshouse building was constructed between 1871-1872 and designed by architect Henry Sims on the plan popular with Pennsylvania almshouses at the time. It was two hundred and forty-four feet long, from seventy-five to fifty feet wide, and three stories high, surmounted by a stone belfry. A two story central wing extends to the buildings rear and likely housed the institutions kitchen and cafeteria on the first floor and chapel on the second. The building was constructed entirely of locally quarried red sandstone and continues to stand to this day. The building was heated by steam, which was provided for by three large boilers installed in an adjacent building in 1874.
On March 21, 1872 a fire consumed the 1821 stone almshouse and took the lives of 6 male patients. Fortunately though, the new building was near completion and the remaining paupers were not left homeless by this tragedy.
On the property were two other buildings used to housed the counties indigent. One, a three story stone building constructed in 1838 was used at the hospital. In the basement of this building was also the accommodation for the institutions male insane patients. The male insane floor contained 11 rooms or ""cells"" measuring roughly 7 foot square in their dimensions. The second stone building was also three stories tall including the basement and constructed of stone. On the second and third floor were the female insane patients. The basement story of this building was occupied by the colored paupers of the institution.
In 1900 and addition to the 1871 was constructed of the same stone and joined to the building via a corridor running off of the eastern wing. These buildings were remodeled in 1940 and the original gabled roof and belfry were removed from the 1871 building. In the later 1960s the eight story ""North Building"" was constructed. Like many county almshouse the focus of the institution is now on geriatric services, and it continues to serve as the county nursing home. It provides 650 full time jobs and provides a full range of physician and nursing services, clinics and X-ray, physical, occupational and speech therapies, recreation and activities.
A potters field cemetery was on the almshouse premises. In 1885 it took up one acre of enclosed ground.

That day, Perry D Snyder, and his wife Mary A Snyder, whom were first elected in March 1913 to serve in respective posts of the New Castle City Home, took up residence in the Lawrence County Home for the Aged.  Along with Mr. and Mrs. Snyder, their two children, about 12 staff members, and the first twenty inmates, left the old City home and also took up residence in the Lawrence County Home. The home continued to operate for many years and in the latter half of the 1960’s was remodeled and slowly changed into a  skilled nursing center while under supervision of Director Clarence E Covert. By 1970 the home was facing severe overcrowding issues, and Covert became bitter about lack of county support and resigned in January of 1973.
In December of 1974 the county decided to add a new section, which is now known as the North Wing, and remodeled some of the existing floors.  A new three-story addition including an additional basement floor was to be built.  This would allow the home to accommodate another thirty or more residents.  A new kitchen and dining room and other occupational rooms were included in the construction.  The north wing opened in mid-1977, and after a contest to find a more suitable name for the Lawrence County Home for the Aged, it was renamed as Hill View Manor on March 22, 1977. Hill View Manor closed it’s doors in 2004 due to financial constraints. Although it seems to sit quietly at the top of the grassy hill above Route 65, evidence of its history remains active.

Built in 1838 by the county commissioners for the county’s indigent, and in a time far removed from the politically correct era of today, it was bluntly named
the “Hospital, Poorhouse & Lunatick House of Northampton County.” The philosophy then current in America was that the poor could provide some relief for themselves by
doing agricultural labor to defray the cost of their care through the sale of farm produce. So the institution was officially known as the “Northampton County House of Employment,” and was part of a 235-acre farm on which residents lived and worked. In one word, the poorhouse, as well as the farm, was simply known as “Gracedale.”
Completed in 1838, the three-story stone structure, 40-by-90 feet in size, was constructed at a cost of $6,284.99. In less than a year after it was built, the county facility was home to 117 elderly, poor, displaced and mentally ill people. The first annual directors report in 1839 for the Northampton County House of Employment listed the produce of Gracedale as rye, wheat, corn, potatoes, flax, beets, onions, radishes, cucumbers, hay, cabbage and pumpkins. Other products included veal, pork, mutton, eggs, butter and soap. Products made by the female poor included women’s frocks, stockings, bed tickings, pillow cases, vests, linen shirts, caps, shoes, pillows and aprons. These items were all sold to the public for poor-support funds.
By 1950, county poorhouses ceased to function as such because care of the poor and mentally ill were taken over by other agencies, as most poorhouses became homes dedicated exclusively to the elderly or permanently disabled. The Northampton County complex underwent a $1.8 million expansion project in 1950, increasing its capacity to 500 beds. It wasn't until 1951 when the newly renovated facility formally became known as Gracedale.
The former Hospital, Poorhouse & Lunatick House of Northampton County, known as the Greystone Building today, is home to Northampton County’s Farmland Preservation, Ag Extension, Bridges and Vector Control offices; Parks & Recreation Department and Backup 911 Center, as well as the Conservation District.

Lackawanna, and a few other counties, acted as an exception to this rule of administration and instead divided the county into separate poor districts, each with their own almshouse. Lackawanna County was divided into five separate poor-districts with five separate poor houses. These were the Blakely Poor-House, Carbondale City Poor-House, Hillside Farm and Almshouse, Northern Luzerne Poor-House, and the Ransom Poor-House, which incorporated in its poor district three townships and four boroughs of Luzerne County.
The Northern Luzerne Poor House was established by an act of the county on April 4, 1868, making it the final poor district to be established in Lackawanna County. The almshouse was was to accommodate the paupers of Newton, North Abington, South Abington, and Scott townships as well as Glenburg and Lapin boroughs. It was located in South Abington township, nine miles from the city of Scranton and central to the poor district it served. By 1886 the poor house sat on 125 acres, originally costing $9000, 70 of which were under cultivation with one being used to garden husbandry. The soil was described as generally sandy.
At the time of the State Board of Public Charities inspection in 1886 the poor farm consisted of the stewards building, the poor house, and a wooden barn. The stewards building was a two story wooden frame structure. The second building used for the paupers was also two stories tall and wooden in construction. The original building, erected in 1871, measured 18x20 feet and is occupied by the female poor. An addition, added in 1874, measures 16x20 feet and is used for the male poor. There was no plumbing, so all water came from a well on property and toilet facilities consisted of three cesspools on property. One cesspool for each sex and one for the stewards family. Once a year these are cleaned out and the contents used to fertilize the farmland.
In 1893 a new frame structure was begun to provide better accomidation for the districts poor. This building was completed by the following year.

In 1820 Perry county was created and the Cumberland County poor-house, falling this new county, became the Perry county poor-house. The paupers of Cumberland County however remained at this location until about 1826, with the first being transferred to Cumberland County on April 14, 1824.
The original brick residence built in 1806 on the property was used as the stewards dwelling. In 1839 a fire destroyed the 1810 structure and a new one was erected by Samuel Shuman which was in use until 1871 when a new building was erected. The 1839 building was two stories tall with a basement. In the basement was contained the kitchen, washroom, ironing room, and dining room with separate table for women and men. The first story was for women and consisted of 9 rooms, including a clothes room, nursery for children, and what was called a ""dead-room"", The second story was occupied by men, though at times women also lived on this story, as according to the 1871 report of Commissioners of Public Charities three women were living on the second story at the time of their visit on August 30th. The building was warmed through a stove and supplied with water forced from a spring. According to the previously mentioned 1871 report ""The building is old, and very much out of repair"".
At thee time of the 1870 visit there was also a third building on the property called the ""mad-house"", which was one story high and twenty by twenty five feet. The building had eight cells for the insane with windows for light and wooden slat doors.
As of 1870 the total population of the Almshouse was 60 with about an even split male and female. The steward salary was $500 and one man was paid by the steward to attend to the farm on property to assist the ""inmates"". A doctor attended to the almshouse twice a week or when necessary. Plans for a new structure were in the words an in 1871 a new building was erected.
The 1871 structure was a four story brick structure 112 by 48 feet with a central projection of 62 feet in depth. Upon its completion the 1839 structure was taken down. The building contains 72 rooms in all. The basement, which is above ground, contains the kitchen, wash rooms, launderies, baker's room, and store rooms. The basement also contained four Boynter's heaters which warmed the rest of the building. Water is pumped into a tank contained on the fourth story.
In the second story contained the sleeping rooms, directors room, offices, and store rooms for the steward. This is located in the central part of the story, while the wings are occupied by the paupers who can care for themselves, separated male and female. Each wing has its own dining room and water closet. The third floor was for the infirm and insane paupers. The insane were chained to the floor to prevent window escape however it appears by 1880 a one story brick building, which at the time of the 1873 visit was being used for vagrants, had been modified for the more violent insane to prevent the danger of keeping them on upper stories.
The first steward after it becamse jurisdiction of Perry County was George Hackett and the first in the present structure was J.B. Trostle.

Pennsylvania,Blockley Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Philadelphia_Almshouse,,,1732,Closed,"1732-1832 Single Building, 1832-1977 Rambling Plan",William Strickland (1830s era buildings),Philadelphia Almshouse  | Philadelphia Almshouse & Hospital | Philadelphia Bettering House | Old Blockley | Philadelphia General Hospital,"With the Friend's Almshouse operating since 1713 the city put off construction of its own facilities until 1732, and the Philadelphia Almshouse was established. Occupying the entire block between Third and Fourth, Spruce and Pine Streets this was the first government funded poorhouse in the United States and was regarded as a model institution, it had separate facilities for the indigent and the insane, and also an infirmary. In 1767, the much larger almshouse with an infirmary, and the house of work were completed on the south side of Spruce Street between Tenth and Eleventh. This facility was used until around 1835.
By 1830, overcrowding necessitated further expansion, and a new almshouse for men and another for women, a separate hospital and a workhouse were built from 1827 to 1832. This included departments for children as well as a segregated department for African Americans This complex was built across the Schuylkill River in Blockley Township, in what is now University City in West Philadelphia. William Strickland was the architect and Samuel Sloan, later to be a well-known architect, worked as a journeyman carpenter on the project. This facility soon became known as ""Old Blockley"". Operated by a city committee known as the Guardians of the Poor, Blockley’s early reputation for care was dismal. In 1864, the ""Female Lunatic Asylum"" building was accidentally destroyed by workers installing heaters, killing 18 women and injuring another 20. Article on Fire By 1885 there had been four fires at the institution. Blockley's geographical isolation from city medical institutions limited clinical care until the University of Pennsylvania, with its medical school, moved to a new site just north of the Almshouse grounds in 1871.
Despite the huge size of the institution for its time, with the ability to accommodate about 3,000, by 1870 it was overcrowded with a population of 3,789. According to the 1878 Annual report of the Board of Commissioners of Public Charities Blockley's Insane department housed 1,200, accounting for a full quarter of all insane in the state. In order to address this overcrowding at Blockley the state built the State Asylum for the Insane at Norristown, opening in 1880 (See Norristown State Hospital). In 1884 the State Lunacy Commission ordered all insane in the state almshouses be transferred to their district's respective hospital. Despite this many insane remained at Blockley simply due to lack of accommodations at Norristown. In 1889 this was amended to allow for transfer of some classes of patients back to state almshouses.
As the latter 19th century saw advancements in both medicine and psychiatry, Blockley’s mission gradually embraced that of a more conventional public hospital. A nursing school was opened at the site 1885 under the direction of Alice Fisher, replacing ad hoc patient nurses with a system of skilled nursing. In 1903, operations of the hospital were turned over to the newly created Bureau of Hospitals in the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. In 1906, the insane were moved to the Byberry Mental Hospital, later known as the Philadelphia State Hospital.
""Old Blockley"" was renamed Philadelphia General Hospital (PGH) in 1919. During the next few decades, the original almshouse buildings were gradually replaced with modern facilities. By the 1950’s the site contained the city’s public hospital, as well as a nursing home and a home for the indigent.
In 1952, the new City Home Rule Charter placed the control of the Philadelphia General Hospital with a Board of Trustees. Under contracts signed in 1959, care at PGH was carried out by the medical schools of Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania who subcontracted work to Jefferson Medical College, Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann Medical School.
By the early 1970s, public support including Medicaid allowed private hospitals to expand treatment for the poor. Facing both financial difficulties as well as a stock of aging buildings, the board of PGH closed the hospital entirely in 1977.
The Almshouse was built by the city in what was then known as Blockley Township, on land purchased from the Andrew Hamilton estate. This parcel of land stretched from what are now known as Civic Center Blvd to Guardian Drive and from University Ave to 34th Street. A blue historical marker was erected on Curie Blvd, formerly Almshouse Lane. commemorating the significance of the site.
Today the site is occupied by parts of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Health System and the Veterans Health Administration and represents a major center of medical research and care in Philadelphia. A long brick wall topped by an ornately decorated iron fence that dates back to Almshouse still forms part of the southern and western boundaries of the site.
The hospital maintained a large potters field on the property adjoining it. This field latter fell into disuse as a cemetery and in later years eventually built over anf forgotten. In 2001, more than 1,000 bodies associated with the Almshouse were recovered from an adjacent construction site and reburied in the nearby Woodlands Cemetery.

Pennsylvania,Mayview State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_City_Farm,1938 (As a PA State Hospital),1892,,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Mayview Poor House | Marshalsea | Pittsburgh City Home and Hospital at Mayview,"In 1804 a building was completed in the newly incorporated City of Pittsburgh. The new building was the city's first ""poor house"", it held a population of 30. In 1818, an increase in the size of the indigent population resulted in the construction of the Allegheny City Almshouse. By 1846, with the continued increase in patients, the city was scouting sites for yet another new almshouse. Roughly 150 acres were acquired along the banks of the Monongahela River at Homestead, in Mifflin township and a three-story brick building was built to hold 300 patients. The City Poor Farm at Homestead opened in 1852 and by 1879 a separate building was erected for treatment of the insane. With a burgeoning population and a conviction that rural settings were healthier, especially for tuberculosis patients, the city made plans to move the hospital again, this time it would be located well outside the city boundaries. Land along the Monongahela was valuable and the city sold its almshouse acreage to the Carnegie Steel Company for $450,000.
The city bought the George Neal Farm in what is now South Fayette Township at Upper St. Clair., and set up a rail station. In 1892 construction on a new hospital named Marshalsea began. A separate building for the insane was erected, and in 1899, and a physician was assigned to the insane department. In response to the need for adequate medical care for inmates, a general hospital was also erected at this site in 1909. Allegheny City, located on Pittsburgh's North Side, also maintained an institution for the poor and insane at Claremont that later became known as Blawnox. When Allegheny City became part of the city of Pittsburgh on December 6, 1907 the patients of Claremont were transferred to Marshalsea.
By 1900, the hospital's reputation as a place of sorrow was firmly established. The Home Monthly, a publication of the time, described the inmates at Marshalsea as ""Poor wrecks of humanity they are -- some mental, some physical, some moral wrecks -- stranded, at last dependent upon the city for enough to keep a miserable broken body and a poor shrunken soul together. ... If there is to-day a discontented man or woman in this city I prescribe a trip to Marshalsea. The blood may flee from the face at times and pity clutch at the heart strings."" Years later, a contest was held to find a more suitable name for the hospital. There were four finalists, the winner was Mayview. By 1916, the State Legislature gave its consent to change the name of the hospital from Marshalsea to the Pittsburgh City Home and Hospital at Mayview.
In accordance with an act of 1938 that required the state to take over all institutions for the care of the mentally ill, the State of Pennsylvania took control of the mental section of the hospital in 1941. The patient population reached a high point of 3,785 in June of 1967, with 1,200 staff and employees. In March 1973, the Department of Public Welfare made plans to move patients judged to be criminally insane from Farview State Hospital to Mayview. In 1982, an adolescent center was transferred from Woodville State Hospital to Mayview. During the closing of Dixmont State Hospital in 1984, the deaf unit was transferred to Mayview.
The patient population gradually reduced starting in the 1970s, by 2008 the hospital only had 354 patients with 800 staff and employees. The hospital provided services to Allegheny, Beaver, Greene, Lawrence and Washington Counties. In addition, a forensic division of the hospital provides services to clients from the entire region west of Harrisburg. Mayview State Hospital was closed by the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare in December of 2008. The remaining patients were individually assessed and were either transferred to another state hospital or to community care facilities.
A series of deaths and other serious incidents (known by the state as ""sentinel events"") started to occur after the closure of the hospital was announced in 2007. In the space of 24 hours in October 2007, two former Mayview patients died violently. Anthony Fallert, who had been released from the hospital in Spring of 2006, wandered from a South Side residence operated by Mercy Behavioral Mental Health. His body was found a day later in the Monongahela River. Authorities believe he had leapt or fallen from the Birmingham Bridge after leaving the facility. In the year after his release from Mayview, Mr. Fallert had lived at facilities in Clarion County and New Kensington and with his mother in Allentown. The day Mr. Fallert's body was being pulled from the river, another former Mayview patient, Ahson J. Abdullah, was struck by a train as he walked on the tracks near his home in Braddock. Mr. Abdullah, who had been in and out of jail over the course of his life, had been a patient at Mayview's forensic unit, which handles mental health cases referred by the courts. In all, state officials say 44 sentinel events have taken place among the region's mentally ill and critics suggest it could run higher. At the same time, the Department of Public Welfare says that of the 44 events cited, only three involved patients released from Mayview since the closure was announced Aug. 15 of 2007 and only 10 of the 44 cases had any prior history with Mayview.
In 2010, the campus was purchased by Aloe Brothers LLC and by early 2013, nearly all the buildings had been demolished. A new residential development now sits on the former site of the hospital as of August 2018.

Pennsylvania,Schuylkill County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Schuylkill_County_Almshouse,1811,,1833,Closed,Single Building,,Schuylkill Haven Sanitarium | Schuylkill County Almshouse and Insane Asylum | Schuylkill County Almshouse Hospital for the Insane | Rest Haven,"Original building was built in 1833. A three-story building was erected in 1859 to care for the elderly. A building for the insane was built in 1869 and a two-story brick building was erected for a bakery and laundry in 1872. In 1911, construction started on a new insane asylum on the hill behind the original almshouse. Although it would later be known as the 1912 Building, the Schuylkill County Hospital for the Insane was actually completed and dedicated in 1913. The total cost of the building was about $571,000 and it was large enough to house 600 residents.
The county discontinued farming operations at the site in 1961 and consolidated its remaining patients into one nursing home building on the property. The county then sold a 42-acre parcel of the land to the university for $1. The purchase included six buildings and a large barn. The only structures acquired in the purchase that were not demolished were the 1897 hospital building, another building constructed in 1913 and a storage building/slaughterhouse built in 1928. Those three buildings were renovated and became the Classroom Building, the Administration Building and the Maintenance Building, respectively.
The current 142-bed Rest Haven facility was built next to the 1912 Building in 1969. The two facilities operated along side each other until the state Department of Health forced the county to close the 1912 Building in 1994 due to its deteriorating condition, according to a 1995 article in the Allentown Morning Call. At that time, the 1912 Building had 120 beds. Rest Haven had a total of 242 residents between both buildings. The 1912 Building was eventually sold to Penn State Schuylkill in 2008 along with 33 acres and a second building that was formerly used by the County Child Development as an administrative office. It was demolished in 2010 after a fire heavily damaged the abandoned structure in the summer of 2009.
Penn State Schuylkill remodeled the other building from the purchase and named it the Kiefer-Jones Building in 2012 in honor of Allen Kiefer and Joseph Jones, both of whom have been involved with the Schuylkill Campus Advisory Board for more than 40 years. It currently houses the offices of chancellor, development and alumni relations, and continuing education. In 2015 Schuylkill County commissioners agreed to sell the nursing facility to Nationwide Health Care Services, Brick, New Jersey, for $12.25 million.

On September 1, 1941 hospital operations changed from Somerset County to the Commonwealth, for the care and treatment of patients with mental disabilities. The hospital stood on 1,000 acres, much of which was cultivated or used by dairy farmers. A portion of the hospital's dairy and vegetable needs were met by a truck garden. The hospital added a Social Service Department in September 1957 that included the appointment of the first professionally trained social worker. The facility grew in size to accomodate 775 patients by 1961 and served Somerset and Fayette Counties. Between 1976 and 1979 an annex that had supported mentally disabled patients at Hollidaysburg State Hospital closed and those patients transferred to Somerset State Hospital. The hospital closed in 1995 as part of the movement to deinstitutionalize patients with mental disabilities. The facility was retrofitted and updated in 1996 and transformed into the minimal security Laurel Highlands State Correctional Institution.  [1]
Timeline history of the Somerset County Poor and House of Employment or Somerset State Hospital:
1845-1846 - Land obtained and building known as Somerset County Poor House
1846: The Somerset County House of Employment or “Poor House” opened on what is now Rt. 31 north of the Kimberly Run Preserve. Benjamin Kimmell, Absalom Casebeer and Joseph Imhoff were the first directors, and they purchased a 265-acre farm known as “Fairview” to support the residents. [2]
1800’s -Institution known as Somerset County Poor and House of Employment
1901 – Addition built as New Somerset County Hospital for the Insane (from Directors Report in Meyersdale Commercial Paper dated March 27, 1902).
1900’s- 1946 – Somerset County Poor and House of Employment and County Hospital for the Insane
1938- Somerset State Hospital
1976-1979- Hollidaysburg Hospital closed and patients moved to Somerset State Hospital.
1898 The Somerset County House of Employment was re-opened as the Somerset County Hospital for patients who were mentally ill (Lepley, 1996).
1995 – Somerset State Hospital Closed
1996 – Site changed hands and currently Laurel Highlands State Correctional Institution.  [3]
""The Directors of the poor have recently been giving more than usual attention to the grave yard on the poor farm in which the bodies of the inmates of the County Home are interred, says the Somerset Standard. The old iron fence which was removed from about the court house lawn has been set up around the grave yard and tombstones are being furnished for the graves. The number of bodies now lying in the grave yard is not known, but it is probably not less than two hundred."" [4]
There are actually at least two cemeteries on the grounds - one that is currently inside the razor wire fence, and which was unearthed a few years ago when the prison was doing site preparation for a new building. According to Linda Kurtz, ""they called the forensic department of Mercyhurst College who did the actual digging. They were not able to identify the remains beyond male/female, adult/child, lost a leg, etc.""
A second cemetery is in the wooded area just North of old Building 7 (as it was called during the State Hospital days.) This would be just North of the Northernmost fenced in area.

Pennsylvania,Tioga County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tioga_County_Almshouse,"March 12, 1866",1866 (original),1868,,,,* Tioga County Farm |  Broad Acres Health and Rehabilitation Center |  Broad Acres (Current),"Prior to 1866 the poor of Tioga County were cared for by the various townships and municipalities they resided in throughout the county. On March 12th of that year the county legislature approved the establishment of a county poor farms and almshouse, so 25 acres were purchased from the Caleb Austin farm one and a half miles East of Wellsboro, PA. By 1885 the almshouse property at the time consisted of 180 acres, with 160 being utilized for cultivation. More land purchases increased this total acreage to 315 acres by 1897.
As of 1885 the poor farm property consisted of a two story wood framed farmhouse building which was occupied by the steward and his family. The alsmhouse stood adjoined at a right angle to the old stewards building. Constructed of brick, the building measured 45x60 feet and cost $12,000 to construct. It stood three stories tall, including the above ground basement, and had an attic story. The basement contained the kitchen, washroom, dining room, and two store  rooms. The second and third story were primarily dormitories, containing 11 rooms each, with two rooms on the second being set aside as infirmaries, one for each sex. The building was designed to accommodate 45 paupers of each sex, however it was noted in the report that the separation of the sexes in the facility was ""entirely inadequate"".
The Insane Department of the almshouse consisted of a small one story wooden shed measuring 20x40 feet near the west end of the brick almshouse building. This structure was essentially a shed with two rooms, one utilized as a rudimentary infirmary for sick men, and the other for the insane of the county. The side for the insane was divided into nine smaller rooms. The report called this building ""a disgrace to the county and a reproach upon those who have the care and protection of the weak and diseased persons who, of necessity, are obliged to receive aid from public charity"" At the time there was no running water on the campus, with all water being brought by bucket from three wells located on the property.
In 1888, after the report by the Pennsylvania Board of Charities, the county decided that the original 1866 buildings were no longer sufficient and ordered them demolished following construction of a new Almhouse. This new building, which seems to have been completed that same year at a cost of $20,000, was reportedly far more well furnished than the previous structures. The building was two stories tall, with an attic story. This building seems to have been used exclusively for paupers at it makes mention in an 1897 book that the insane were cared for in a separate structure. This building stands today and is used as the offices of the Tioga Human Services Department.
Over time, as with many county poorhouses, the focus of the Tioga County Farm shifted from the indigent and the insane to the elderly and geriatric. The county farm remains in operation today as a home for the old and infirm, know as the Broad Acres Health and Rehabilitation Center. This current facility is housed north of the 1888 almshouse in buildings constructed likely between 1950-1970. Broad Acres today ""is a 120 bed center and offers a full continuum of services and care, focused around each individual in today's ever-changing healthcare environment.""
The Tioga County Alsmhosue did have a potters field, now known as Broad Acres Farm Cemetery. It is located at 1768 Shumway Hill Road in Wellsboro across the street from the Tioga County Jail on county property. The cemetery was used from at least 1870 until 1936, though possibly earlier and later. While some headstones exist they take up only 10% of the land the the majority of graves are now unmarked.

The first Washington County Commissioners purchased land situated in Chartiers and North Strabane Townships from Robert Colmery on August 19, 1830. The property comprised 172 acres and the purchase price was $2,752.00. The site is adjacent to the Chartiers Valley Railroad and the former Washington and Cononsburg Electric Railway Line, 1/4 mile east of the former Arden Station. In 1865 six additional acres were purchased and in 1867 another twenty-eight acres were added to the property. The first building was erected in 1831 and was replaced when the present main building was commenced in 1872 and completed in 1874. The institution was known as the Washington County Home for the Poor from 1831 to 1883, when separate institutions were built for women and children. Since 1883, families were no longer housed at this facility, and it became known as the Washington County Old Men's Home. The main building is an example of institutional type architecture built in the Second Empire style of architecture. [1]

After the General Election, the County Commissioners purchased about 180 acres of land from a William Snyder of Hempfield Township. The County Home was along present day U.S. Route 119 and on the land currently is the Westmoreland Manor, the Pennsylvania Regional Correctional Institute, and the Westmoreland County Juvenile Detention Center.  The first Westmoreland County Home burned down in 1862, the second in 1878, and the third building stood until the 1950s.

Pennsylvania,York County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=York_County_Almshouse,"Feb 6, 1804",,1805,"Active, Demolished (original campus)","Single Building,",Edward Haviland (1859 Building),York County Poorhouse |  York County Hospital & Home |  Pleasant Acres Nursing & Rehabilitation Center,"The York County Almshouse was opened originally as a single building institution, as most almshouses were, in 1805. It was located on 142 acres of land, of which 122 were under cultivation by the indigent at the facility and 4 under garden husbandry. The original building was constructed in 1805 at a cost of $4761.34. In 1828 a new structure was erected; it consisted of a two story brick building with a basement and an attic, measuring 113' by 42' in size. By 1886 this building was primarily used for administrative purposes, the stewards housing, the quarters for the staff, and the accommodation for the ""working poor"" of the institution. The basement was also contained the kitchen.
In 1859 a larger hospital was deemed needed an was constructed on the site of the original 1805 almshouse. This building was designed by architect Edward Haviland, son of famous Philadelphia architect John Haviland who designed Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia and the original Kirkbride atHarrisburg State Hospital. Edward Haviland had already designed the adjacent York County Jail in 1855 and as a result of this almshouse was in 1868 elected to design the Bedford County Almshouse. This new building had a 138 foot frontage and was 130 feet deep, built of brick, and was three stories tall with an attic and slate roof. The building consists of a center portion with additional wings build on the rear of either side. The southern wing housed the male occupants and the northern the female. The second floor contained two insane wards of ten rooms each for male and female patients respectively. The third floor contained the institutions infirmary for injuries. The basement of this building was used for the colored inmates and contained its own kitchen.
As of the 1886 State Charities Report the institution did not provide any accommodation for the counties aged and infirm nor did it separate the inmates by ny classification other than insane. The aged, dirty, feeble-minded, violent, epileptic, infirm, were all accommodated for in mixed wards. The bedding and accommodations of the institution were called ""filthy and abominable"". Though the there were insane wards the report mentioned they were improper and if any insane were to be housed there it would be a disservice to their recovery. By the time of the 1902 report this appears to have changed. The institution was then holding 186 inmates, 37 of whom were insane. 
The report mentioned the building was in excellent order and the patients well clothed and contented.
From 1883 until 1927 a law required children without physical or mental disabilities be allowed to stay in the home for a maximum of 60 days. Following this time period the children would be sent off as indentured servants or apprentices. They also could then be sent to foster homes.
In 1855 the county commissioned a prison to be built on the adjacent property to the west of the almshouse complex, which was later expanded upon in 1906. The original almshouse complex has since been demolished as has the 1855 prison designed by Edward Haviland. The 1906 jail structure remains however.  Today the former alsmhouse site is occupied by the Alexander Goode School. The almshouse was moved from its original location sometime between 1915 and 1933, as a 1933 sanborn shows the buildings listed as vacant. The likey cause of this move was a 1915 report from the state which called for York County to improve on the consitions at the alsmhouse. By 1950 maps show the almshouse to have been demolished.
With the laws regarding state and Federal welfare following the great depression the almshouse shifted its mission for care for the insane and indigent to caring for the old as a nursing home. It currently still operates at a newer county municipal campus as the York County Hospital and Home, called Pleasant Acres Nursing & Rehabilitation Center. The annex to the new hospital campus is still in use, being topped by a large cupola.

Pennsylvania,Sleighton Farm School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sleighton_Farm_School,1826,1909,1911,Closed,Cottage Plan,Cope and Stewardson,Glen Mills School Girls Department | House of Refuge in Philadelphia,"The Sleighton Farm School began in 1826 as the House of Refuge in Philadelphia and was established by the Quakers and the Pennsylvania Prison Society to avoid placing children and young offenders in prison. Its goal was to re-educate at-risk youth and rehabilitate rather than punish. However admirable the school’s objectives were, abuse and punishment were a daily part of life.
Children began their days at 5 am, then spent five to six hours performing hard labor followed by three to four hours of schooling. A brief period of play was granted after dinner. In 1876, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives investigated reports of abuse at the House of Refuge. They found that punishment included banning of recreation time, withholding meals, solitary confinement, and lashings. Despite the long working hours of the children, they received zero pay while the institution raked in thousands of dollars in profits per year. In the end, the House of Refuge was found not guilty of abuse.
In an effort to save face, the House of Refuge adopted a new curriculum, one that focused on a more family-like community for its students and would offer the benefits of therapy through farming and a pastoral setting.
In 1892, the House of Refuge moved to Thornbury Township and reopened as the Glen Mills School in 1911. In 1906, the House of Refuge bought another tract of country in Glen Mills and hired well-known Philadelphia architects Cope and Stewardson to design the dormitories and campus buildings of what would become the “Glen Mills School Girls Department.” Male students were to remain at the Glen Mills School. Construction on the girls school began in 1909 and opened its doors in 1910.
The original school plan included nine dormitory cottages (Campbell, Dubois-Miller, Harrison, Lincoln, Logan, Lucrettia Mott, Robinson, Washington, and Watson), an administrative building, small cottage, stone barn, and power plant. The buildings main design style are Colonial Revival and Georgian Revival, two popular architectural styles of the early 20th century. Additional property and buildings were acquired over the years, including what became Stokes Cottage and Little House.
Every girl admitted to the school was sent there on a court order and had already experienced living in an institutional setting, whether that was at an orphanage or poor house, but most had already been sentence to a correctional facility before coming to the farm school. Them most common offenses for these young females included “incorrigibility,” an extremely broad and intentionally ill-defined charge that referred to any number of criminal offenses, “immorality,” larceny, breaking probation, and attempted suicide. Both Black and white females were sent to Sleighton. Ages of the students ranged from nine years to twenty years old. After spending two years at Sleighton, the students are assigned to a parole officer who place them in suitable homes or occupations.
In 1931, the school changed its name to the Sleighton Farm School for Girls and by 1949, the campus had grown to 350 acres with a student population of 260 females.
The Sleighton Farm School became co-ed again in 1975 and closed in 2001.
