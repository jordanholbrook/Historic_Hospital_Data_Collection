Nebraska,Genoa State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Genoa_State_Hospital,1884,,1936 (as a state hospital),Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Genoa Indian Industrial School | Genoa State Farm,"The Indian Industrial School at Genoa was the fourth non-reservation boarding institution established by the Office of Indian Affairs. The facility opened on February 20, 1884, and, like other such schools, its mission stressed assimilation into white society through a combination of manual training and education.  The village of Genoa was selected because the Federal Government already owned the former Pawnee Reservation property there and it was several days ride from any reservation. The students that came to the Genoa Indian school were from all over the United States and over 40 tribes. In time the school grew from the original 74 students to an enrollment of 599, and encompassed over 30 buildings on 640 acres.
As the Great Depression of the 1930s worsened, Indian parents became more willing to send their children to boarding schools. In 1933, the Bureau of Indian Affairs notified Indian boarding schools to enroll only the neediest of children. Soaring enrollments, encouraged by the bad economic times of the Depression, was the reason for limiting enrollment. In 1934, the government closed the Genoa Indian School.
The Genoa Indian School was donated to the state of Nebraska in 1934. The Legislature in 1935 designated it the Genoa State Hospital. In 1937 the Legislature changed the name to Genoa State Farm. The Penitentiary discontinued its operation during the W.W. II period. When it closed it was given to the University of Nebraska and made into a seed farm. In 1951 most of the buildings were auctioned off.
In 1976, the Genoa Indian School was declared a State Historical Site and in 1978 it was designated as a National Historical Site. Today the Genoa US Indian School Foundation operates the facility as the Genoa U.S. Indian School Museum. The museum attracts about 3,000 visitors annually. The only building that remains from the school is the Manual Training building which has been restored with new windows, doors, heating and air conditioning.",1951,"Genoa, NE",,
Nebraska,Hastings State Hospital Nebraska,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hastings_State_Hospital_Nebraska,1887,,1889,Demolished,Cottage Plan,Charles C Rittenhouse,Asylum for the Incurable Insane (1889-1894) | Asylum for the Chronic Insane (1895-1904) | Nebraska State Hospital (1905-1914) | Ingleside Hospital for the Insane (1915-1921) | Hastings State Hospital (1921-1970) | Hastings Regional Center (1971 - 1987)  | Hastings Correctional Center (1987-2005),"With the population of the state increasing, the need for another hospital became evident, and in 1887, the legislature appropriated $75,000 for a ""state asylum for the incurably insane"" to be located at Hastings if the city would donate 160 acres of land for the purpose. The citizens of Hastings purchased 160 acres one mile west of the city limits. The land area was eventually increased to 630 acres. Patients were first received at the hospital on August 1, 1889 when forty four were transferred from Lincoln. Melvin Meals was assigned Number One and remained a patient until his death in 1895. Through 1916, 4,115 patients had been received. In December, 1916 there were 1,152 inmates, 405 women and 747 men.
Charles C Rittenhouse, Hastings architect, drew the plans for the building which was a three story brick with a tall central tower. In 1891 the north and south wings were added to the original building and in 1902 the North Annex was erected. In 1904 an amusement hall was built where dances and entertainments were held for patients. During this period the farm cottage and two greenhouses were built. In 1914 a large dairy barn was built and a herd of Holstein cows milked each day. A medical surgical building was erected in 1926, and in 1938 a psychiatric hospital was built. In 1957 the All Faiths Chapel was built with funds from thousands of donors.
Politics were the essential requisite for the job of superintendent in the early days of the institution. Dr. M. W. Stone, the first superintendent, came from Wahoo in May, 1889.
Originally the institution received inmates from the hospitals at Lincoln and Norfolk who were believed to be incurable, and the name of the Hastings hospital was ""Hospital for the Incurably Insane."" The legislature changed the name to ""Asylum for the Chronic Insane"" in 1895. In 1905 the name was changed to ""Nebraska State Hospital"" and in 1915 to ""Ingleside Hospital for the Insane"" , and in 1921 to ""Hastings State Hospital"" and in 1971 to its current name, ""Hastings Regional Center.""
In the 1800s patients were admitted to the asylums for many of the same reasons that bring people into psychiatric care today.  The same mental illnesses existed then as now, the same stressors existed then as now, poverty, hunger, exhaustion, domestic troubles, disappointment in love, medical ailments, overwork, intemperance, substance abuse.  But at that time physicians also thought that such things as masturbation triggered psychiatric disturbances and it was listed as a trigger and religious excitement was listed as a trigger when generally it was a symptom instead.
Early care of the patients was primarily custodial. Patients were trained to make beds, sweep floors, wash and polish furniture and to care for their own clothes. Winter and summer, patients retired at 8:00 p.m. The inmates were primarily cared for by ward attendants who lived on the wards. They were on duty 22 hours a day with only one half day off per week. Room and board were part of their salary and they had to be single. There were four supervisors, two male and two female. There were no graduate nurses, no technicians, and no physicians other than the assistant superintendent. There was an official steward and bookkeeper, a farmer, a gardener, and an engineer and his assistant.
Patients did most of the work on the farm and in the dairy. Hastings newspapers listed the amount of fall harvest and in 1929 reported the animal population as 125 turkeys, 3000 chickens, 400 ducks, 400 hogs, 300 pigs, and a dairy herd. The main objective of the farm was that the hospital be able to feed itself. In 1905 a post office named Ingleside was established on the grounds. The hospital superintendents were postmasters until 1913 when Percy Jones became the first civil service postmaster. The post office closed in 1972. From 1905 until 1972 the institution was commonly called Ingleside, the name of the post office.
During the 1920s and 1930s, a tuberculosis ward was located at the hospital. The early 1920s saw the first attempt at treatment of the mentally ill. Electro-shock treatment, which produced convulsions in the patient was begun. In the 1930s and 1940s, fever therapy, hydro-therapy and insulin shock therapy were begun. In the 1920s a dentist was hired. Prior to that inmates dental problems were simply ignored. Early in the 1950s the biggest beak-through in treatment came with the discovery of psychiatric drugs, which included tranquilizers. From that time on it was possible to unlock wards and start a program of rehabilitation of the inmate. Such services as occupational therapy, industrial therapy, recreational therapy, religious therapy, vocational therapy, psycho-therapy, reality therapy, transactional analysis and behavior modification were added.
In July, 1963 the Hastings State Hospital was re-organized into two Unit Hospitals, psychiatric and alcoholic. The south end of the campus was converted into a minimum security prison in 1987. The first inmates were admitted in June 1987, starting with 11 inmates from the Lincoln Community Corrections Center who worked as construction crew for the interior renovations. Fencing and razor wire was added to transform the building for use as the Hastings Correctional Center. After renovations were complete, the prison had a capacity of 160 inmates, but was often below capacity. A 17-foot-high tower was added to the prison in 1988 to provide added security after several prisoners escaped in the facility’s early days. The prison was slated to close in 2002 due to budget cuts proposed by then-Gov. Mike Johanns. In that same time frame, the state ended key programming at the Hastings Regional Center as it revamped the mental health system to emphasize more community-based services.
The federal government took over the former Hastings Correctional Center facility in 2002 for use as a detention center by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but it wasn’t used enough to justify its continued use, and the building was closed for good in 2005. In 2016 the legislature approved the building of a new facility and 2 living units. Starting in April, 2020 demolition began on 6 vacant buildings. The structure, known as Building 25 on the HRC map, is one of several that have been demolished recently or are slated for demolition on the mostly idle campus. A new Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center for females is planned to open on the campus this year.
The cemetery has been in use since the institution opened, but no record of burials prior to 1909 exists. Numbers were used to mark the graves, there are no markers which contain names. About 1,000 people are buried in the cemetery. The last burial occurred in 1956.

Nebraska,Lincoln State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lincoln_State_Hospital,1865,,1870,Active,Cottage Plan,,Nebraska Hospital for the Insane | Nebraska State Hospital | Lincoln Regional Center (Current),"This institution is located at Lincoln. As early as 1865, it was found necessary to make provision for the insane in the Territory of Nebraska. Four cases were already being cared for in an Iowa hospital. The legislature authorized the governor to make some arrangement with the State of Iowa, by which they received and cared for the insane at the expense of Nebraska. Under this arrangement fifty patients were sent at various times to the hospital at Mount Pleasant. Soon after Nebraska became a State the governor, secretary of State and auditor of public accounts were appointed a board of commissioners to locate a site for a State lunatic asylum near the city of Lincoln. The first building was completed at a cost of $137,000 in the fall of 1870, and the first patient was admitted November 26th of that year. Early in the following December, seventeen patients were brought over from Mount Pleasant to the new institution, and four were admitted who had been confined in the Pawnee county jail. Dr. N. B. Larsh was the first superintendent.
In April, 1871, the institution was destroyed by fire. Five patients were reported missing and were never afterwards accounted for. The remaining patients were taken to Lincoln and cared for in rented houses until a temporary building was erected on the asylum grounds. As there was no appropriation available, and the citizens of Lincoln were fearful lest the institution should be removed to some rival city, they advanced the funds necessary to build a temporary frame structure, which did service as a hospital until a new stone building was erected the following year. Since that time the institution has been enlarged by the erection of additional buildings, until today it is one of the most modern institutions of its kind in the country. As the population of the State increased, the number of insane persons likewise increased, thereby making it necessary to increase the capacity of the hospital. The congestion was also relieved by the erection of other institutions at Hastings and Norfolk. The first patients were sent to the Norfolk hospital February 15, 1888, and to the Asylum for the Chronic Insane at Hastings, August 1, 1889.
Originally the State guaranteed the expense of caring for insane patients, and when possible, collected the amount so expended from the estate of the patient, or from his or her natural guardians. Later the superintendent certified to the auditor the number of patients from each county, and the auditor of public accounts certified to the commissioners of the several counties the amounts due for the maintenance of their insane. In 1883 this was changed and the State assumed the entire expense of caring for this class of persons. A new building was completed in 1872.
The name of this facility was changed to the Lincoln State Hospital in 1921 and to the Lincoln Regional Center in 1969. From an initial total of less than 50, the number of patients has varied as methods of diagnosis and treatment of mental illness have changed. In 1955 the patient census was 1750. By the 1980s, with modern medicines and an emphasis on outpatient care, the hospital had fewer than 250 residents.

This authorization resulted in the Nebraska Psychiatric Institute (NPI) a teaching, research and intensive treatment hospital, operated jointly by the Nebraska Board of Control and the University of Nebraska Board of Regents.
Construction of NPI was completed in 1955 at the cost of $1.5 million. NPI housed 92 beds, a special research ward, laboratory, day therapy for children and adults, and facilities for the intensive study of psychiatric problems in children. Director Dr. Cecil Wittson's innovation in research, service, teaching, and technology led to the institute receiving the American Psychiatric Association's Mental Hospital Service Award in 1958.

Nebraska,Norfolk State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norfolk_State_Hospital,"March 4, 1885",,"February 15, 1888",Active,Cottage Plan,,Insane Asylum in Norfolk | Nebraska State Hospital | Norfolk Hospital for the Insane | Norfolk Regional Center (Current),"The Norfolk Regional Center was established in 1885 as an insane asylum under the name Norfolk Hospital for the Incurably Insane on 320 acres of land provided by the city of Norfolk.
The reason for the establishment of a state hospital at Norfolk was because of the fact that there was no hospital located in the northern part of the state, the two hospitals existing being located, one at Lincoln, Neb., in the southeast part of the state, and the other at Hastings, Neb., in the southwest part of the state; the City of Norfolk is located in the northeast part of the state.
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Nebraska:
1. That there shall be established in the State of Nebraska an institution under the name and style of ""A Hospital for the Insane of Nebraska.""
2. That the said hospital for the insane of Nebraska be, and the same is hereby, established and located within three miles of the corporate limits of the city or town of Norfolk, Neb., on such site as may be deemed most practicable by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings. Provided, however, that the said city or town of Norfolk shall donate to the State of Nebraska a tract of land containing not less than 320 acres of good land upon which to locate the said institution.
4. That the sum of $75,000 be and the same is hereby appropriated out of the state general fund for the purpose of erecting the necessary buildings.
5. The entire cost of the buildings, including advertising and other expenses, must in nowise exceed the amount appropriated in section 4 of this act.
6. Upon the day specified in said advertisement, said board shall proceed to examine such plans and specifications, and adopt the one best calculated to subserve the wants of the institution. In case no plan is adopted the board shall continue to advertise, as provided for in section 5 of this act, until a plan is accepted.
7. Upon the adoption of a plan said board shall advertise in a way and manner provided for in section 5 of this act for sealed proposals to build said buildings, according to the plans and specifications adopted.
9. Before entering upon this contract the contractor shall be required to execute a good and sufficient bond, to be approved by the said board, in the sum of $50,000 for the faithful performance of said contract.
10. The Auditor of Public Accounts is hereby authorized to draw his warrant on the State Treasurer for the amount specified in this act whenever the proper vouchers, approved by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, are presented to him for payment.
The Norfolk State Hospital was opened for the reception of patients February 15, 1888, when 43 female patients and 54 male patients were transferred from the Hospital for the Insane at Lincoln, Neb. In the late fall of 1901 a fire occurred, which destroyed most of this building. It was rebuilt on the cottage plan, so that there are now three cottages constructed of brick and two of stone, besides the one wing of the old asylum building erected before the fire, which was repaired and reconstructed. Besides the above there is one brick building used for offices and quarters for officers. Dr. Kelley was the first superintendent, but as the hospital was destroyed by fire in the fall of 1901, there are no records showing the names and terms of service of the different superintendents and assistants prior to that time.
After the fire when the hospital was rebuilt Dr. J. M. Alden was appointed superintendent March 15, 1905, and resigned on October 8, 1906. Dr. F. S. Nicholson was appointed assistant May 20, 1905, and resigned August 1, 1906, when Dr. H. D. Singer was appointed to take his place. Dr. G. A. Young was appointed superintendent October 8, 1906, and served until February 1, 1909. Dr. Singer resigned as first assistant August 15, 1907, and was succeeded by Dr. G. W. Dishong. Dr. Ernest Kelley was appointed second assistant December 28, 1907. Dr. J. P. Percival was appointed superintendent February 1, 1909, and served until February 1, 1911. Dr. W. D. Guttery was appointed first assistant February 1, 1909, and served until June 1, 1911. Dr. Ernest Kelley resigned May 26, 1910, and was succeeded by Dr. L. M. Lombard, who served until November 10, 1910, and he in turn was succeeded by Dr. H. M. Newman November 10, 1910, who served until February 1, 1911.
Dr. A. Johnson was appointed superintendent February 1, 1911, and is still in charge of this hospital. Dr. H. C. Carson was appointed second assistant physician June 1, 1911, and upon the resignation of Dr. G. W. Dishong November 1, 1911, was promoted to first assistant, and is still serving in that capacity. Dr. J. S. Simms was appointed second assistant physician February 1. 1912.[1]
The institution went through several name changes. In 1895, the legislature voted to call it the Asylum for the Chronic Insane. In 1905, the name was changed to Nebraska State Hospital, and then again in 1915 it was renamed the Ingelside Hospital for the Insane. The facility had four types of patients: Geriactrics, Alcoholics and drug addicts, and the criminally insane. The Norfolk Regional Center is currently a mental health and substance abuse treatment facility for adolescent and young adult males who have been paroled from the Youth Rehabilitation Treatment Center in Kearney, Nebraska (Nebraska Dept of Health). In total 902 individuals were sterilized in Nebraska. 53% of whom were women. 80% of those sterilized were deemed “mentally deficient.” The lobotomies began in 1917 and ended in 1963.
The first law regarding sterilization was passed in 1915, after a failed initial attempt by state legislators in 1913 was vetoed by Governor John H. Morehead. This law was revised in both 1929 and 1957. The 1915, law provided for the sterilizations of the insane and feeble-minded inmates of state institutions before they were paroled. The state institutions specifically mentioned in the statute included “institutions for the feeble-minded, hospitals for the insane, the penitentiary, reformatory, industrial schools, the industrial home, and other such State institutions” In 1929, the original law was repealed and a new law was enacted, which included “habitual criminals, moral degenerates, and sexual perverts“—those individuals convicted of rape or incest—as well as the original groups. The 1929 revision of the law made it so that any inmate convicted of rape or other crimes of sexual perversion were to be compulsorily sterilized. Although the sterilization was mandatory for these individuals, the law mandated both notice and hearing and the potential for appeal to the Supreme Court.
Although habitual criminals and sex offenders were included in the law between 1929 and 1957, the “feeble-minded” were the initial targets. They remained a group of concern for several years after the state ceased its sterilizations of the criminally insane. The ratio of men to women sterilized is relatively equal, indicating no presence of bias toward either sex. In 1929, the Nebraska legislature altered the sterilization law to include those individuals convicted of sodomy. This amendment included individuals who had been deemed “moral degenerates or sexual perverts”. According to data provided by Julius Paul, more than 80% of sterilizations occurred on residents of the Beatrice State Home, founded in 1887 as the Nebraska Institution for Feebleminded Youth. The institution is now known as the Beatrice State Developmental Center, specializing in the treatment of children and adults with behavioral and developmental disabilities (Nebraska Dept. of Health). The website makes no mention of the location’s past involvement with eugenics and sterilization. In terms of a history, the website states, briefly, that the Center “has served citizens with mental retardation since 1887”.
It was renamed the Norfolk Regional Center, and has 120-beds in part of a Sex Offender Treatment Center providing Phase I services in the Nebraska Sex Offender Treatment Program. The Nebraska Sex Offender Treatment Program is a three phase treatment program meant to reduce dangerousness and risk of re-offense for patients involved in treatment. Phase I treatment orients patients to the treatment process; begins working with patients to accept full responsibility for their sex offending and sexually deviant behaviors; teaches patients to give and receive feedback and utilize coping skills; and builds motivation for the intensive treatment in Phases II and III which are provided at Lincoln Regional Center.[2]

In 1892, the then Nebraska State Reform School for Juvenile Offenders, became a male-only youth facility with the establishment of the female youth facility in Geneva, Nebraska.
The original 320-acre Kearney campus was developed on land donated to the State of Nebraska by the City of Kearney.
The State of Nebraska returned nearly 200 acres to the City of Kearney for the development of a city-operated golf course in 1991. On January 1, 1994, the institutional name was changed for the fifth time to the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center by the Nebraska Unicameral. YRTC-K also was placed legislatively under the Office of Juvenile Services within the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services.
On January 1, 1997, the Unicameral merged the Office of Juvenile Services with four other State agencies to form the Health and Human Services System. On July 1, 2007 HHSS reorganized into the Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS). DHHS is the parent agency under which YRTC-K is one of nine 24 hour care facilities including three Regional centers, three Veterans Homes, one Development Center, and the two YRTC’s. YRTC-K is within the DHSS Policy Section.",,"Kearney, OK",,

In 1923, the official name, ""Girls Industrial School"" was changed to ""Girls Training School.""
In 1970, the name was changed to the ""Youth Development Center - Geneva."" With the passage of LB988 in 1994, the facility became the “Youth Rehabilitation & Treatment Center.” On January 13, 1967, the facility became partially co-educational as 8-12 year old boys from the YRTC-Kearney were moved to the YRTC-Geneva. This program was terminated in 1973 due to a decreasing number of boys. YRTC-Geneva again became co-educational in 1980 by admitting all youth referred for evaluation. The YRTC-Geneva discontinued doing evaluations in 1999.

Nebraska,Nebraska Institution for Feeble-minded Youth,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Nebraska_Institution_for_Feeble-minded_Youth,1885,,1887,Active,Cottage Plan,,Institution for Feeble Minded Youth Farm | Beatrice State Home | Beatrice State Developmental Center,"Beatrice State Home was founded as the State Institution for the Feeble Minded Youth on March 5, 1885. The State Institution for the Feeble Minded Youth was founded as the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-minded Youth in 1885 in Beatrice, Nebraska for the purpose of:
""providing special means of improvement for that unfortunate 
portion of the community who were born, or by disease have become, 
imbecile or feeble-minded.""[1].
In 1921, the name was changed to the Nebraska Institution for the Feeble-minded along with a new mission statement, which aimed to provide ""custodial care and human treatment for those who are feeble-minded, to segregate them from society, to study to improve their condition, to classify them, and to furnish such training in industrial mechanics, agriculture, and academic subjects as fitted to acquire"".
By 1935, in order to assure complete separation from society, NIFM resident’s graves were no longer marked with family names, but with numbers; families desired to disassociate themselves from their “defective” relatives by dehumanizing them. The institution changed its name again in 1942 to the Beatrice State Home, a friendlier title. Sterilizations were confined solely to the Beatrice State Home in 1957.
By the mid-1960's the Center had reached its peak census of over 2,200. Since it had neither the physical plant nor the staff to provide even minimally adequate custodial care, several hundred of its residents were temporarily transferred to the Norfolk Regional Center and the former Kearney Tuberculosis Hospital. While that effort did little to improve
conditions for the majority of the residents who remained, it signified an executive commitment to end an eighty year reliance on the facility as Nebraska's only solely state supported and operated residential/training program exclusively for mentally retarded Nebraskans of all ages.
According to a 1976 report from Carl Botsford, from the Nebraska Institute of Engineering;
""The Beatrice State Home was established in response to a parent association 
for the school for the deaf. Many parents of retarded children were asking to 
get their child admitted but the school for the deaf was not equipped to meet 
the retarded child's needs. Therefore, the Institution for Feeble Minded Youths 
was established by legislative action and was opened and received the first 
patients in May of 1887."" 
The legislature in 1945 renamed it the Beatrice State Home. Now in 1976 
we've named it the Beatrice State Developmental Center. (None of these name 
changes help switch board operators.) 
""In 1943 the biennial report stated that ""During the first 56 year period, 
4,348 patients have been admitted and taken care of in the Institution. At the 
close of the present biennium the patient population consisted of 1,480 patients 
present at the Institution and 163 patients living away from the Institution, 
on parole. It is interesting to note that there is still present the second 
patient to be admitted to the institution and he has been there continuously 
for the 56 years."" [2]
Through the 1960s, three perspectives governed the asylum: education, asylum, and social control. By 1966, 752 residents at the Beatrice facility had been sterilized. Then, on July 1st, 1975, the Beatrice State Home became the Beatrice State Developmental Center, the name that it holds today. The Center specializes in the treatment of children and adults with behavioral and developmental disabilities. In 2009, the center lost its federal funding after being cited for inadequate medical care. The facility has rebounded in recent years, and the number of residents has declined from 370 a decade ago. However, concerns about the high cost of care at Beatrice, and its shrinking population, prompted state lawmakers in 2016 to order a study of its future.

Nebraska,Genoa State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Genoa_Indian_Training_School,1884,,1936 (as a state hospital),Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Genoa Indian Industrial School | Genoa State Farm,"The Indian Industrial School at Genoa was the fourth non-reservation boarding institution established by the Office of Indian Affairs. The facility opened on February 20, 1884, and, like other such schools, its mission stressed assimilation into white society through a combination of manual training and education.  The village of Genoa was selected because the Federal Government already owned the former Pawnee Reservation property there and it was several days ride from any reservation. The students that came to the Genoa Indian school were from all over the United States and over 40 tribes. In time the school grew from the original 74 students to an enrollment of 599, and encompassed over 30 buildings on 640 acres.
As the Great Depression of the 1930s worsened, Indian parents became more willing to send their children to boarding schools. In 1933, the Bureau of Indian Affairs notified Indian boarding schools to enroll only the neediest of children. Soaring enrollments, encouraged by the bad economic times of the Depression, was the reason for limiting enrollment. In 1934, the government closed the Genoa Indian School.
The Genoa Indian School was donated to the state of Nebraska in 1934. The Legislature in 1935 designated it the Genoa State Hospital. In 1937 the Legislature changed the name to Genoa State Farm. The Penitentiary discontinued its operation during the W.W. II period. When it closed it was given to the University of Nebraska and made into a seed farm. In 1951 most of the buildings were auctioned off.
In 1976, the Genoa Indian School was declared a State Historical Site and in 1978 it was designated as a National Historical Site. Today the Genoa US Indian School Foundation operates the facility as the Genoa U.S. Indian School Museum. The museum attracts about 3,000 visitors annually. The only building that remains from the school is the Manual Training building which has been restored with new windows, doors, heating and air conditioning.",1951,"Genoa, NE",,
Nebraska,Bethphage Mission at Axtell,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bethphage_Mission_at_Axtell,1913,,1914,Active,Single Building,,Bethphage Village (current),"The Rev. K.G. William Dahl witnessed the neglect that children and adults with developmental disabilities received in large institutions. He believed in a better way and convinced 54 people to give $1 each to establish Bethphage Inner Mission Association in 1913.
With the start-up money, Pastor Dahl rented and renovated four homes in Axtell. On June 29, 1914, the first four guests arrived. Within a year, the ministry had grown to include 40 guests and 20 workers, and a new setting on land north of Axtell. The ""hill,"" as the Bethphage Mission casually came to be known, reflected a unique architectural style hearkening to Pastor Dahl's native Sweden. A prominent building at Bethphage is Zion Chapel, dedicated May 20, 1931, as a gift of the Women's Missionary Society of the Augustana Synod.
Pastor Dahl died in 1917, at 34. He is buried in the Bethphage Cemetery.
Mosaic was formed July 1, 2003, by the consolidation of two Nebraska-born Lutheran ministries dedicated to the needs of people with disabilities. Bethphage began in 1913 in Axtell, Neb., and Martin Luther Homes began in 1925 in Sterling, Neb.
With the advent of community-based programs for people with developmental disabilities in the 1970s and 1980s, both Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes grew into national ministries. The organizations were invited to begin services in locations across the United States by families and officials who knew the quality of care provided by the organizations.
With their national growth, both organizations felt the need for administrative offices in more easily accessible locations for national travelers. In 1986 Bethphage moved its headquarters to Omaha, Neb., and in 1993 Martin Luther Homes moved its headquarters to Lincoln, Neb.
Throughout their histories, both organizations maintained close ties with the Church. As Church structures changed and realigned over the years, Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes both became affiliated ministries of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, when that body was formed in 1988.
Their shared mission, shared vision and shared Church affiliation prompted the two organizations' Boards of Directors to vote to merge the two ministries, a move that became complete July 1, 2003.
Throughout their histories, both legacy organizations changed as needed to carry forth the vision of their founders. The priority has been, and continues to be, the needs and desires of the people Mosaic supports.
Pastor Dahl once wrote, ""Retrogression or even a standstill must never be heard at the Mission."" Pastor Hoeger, whose motto was ""Always forward!"" wrote, ""Thus we are sisters and brothers in this work. If the angels are glad to serve us and human beings, then how much more should we be thankful and happy that we can also help others who need our help.""

Nebraska,Martin Luther Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Martin_Luther_Home,,,1925,Active,Single Building,,,"Three pastors and two laymen saw the need for a school for children with disabilities. They met in Sterling at the former Martin Luther Academy, a school that had been closed for several years. The founders included the Revs. Julius Moehl, August Hoeger, and William Fruehling, and laymen John Aden and William Ehmen. The Martin Luther Home Society was organized on October 20, 1925.
As word spread that a home for children and adults with disabilities was opening in Sterling, families began bringing their children for placement, even though the Home was not ready. Pastor Moehl, pastor of St. John Lutheran Church in Sterling, and his wife, Martha, had three small children of their own. Yet they took these students into their home and assumed responsibility for their care.
As the building aged and the student population grew, extensive renovation was needed or the Home would face the possibility of state closure. The decision was made to build a new facility. The organization moved to Beatrice in 1956 to a newly-built campus. In 2003 Martin Luther Homes consolidated with Bethphage to become Mosaic.",,"Sterling, NE",,
Nebraska,Nebraska Hospital for Tuberculosis,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Nebraska_Hospital_for_Tuberculosis,,,1912,Preserved,Single Building,John Latenser and Sons,Kearney State Tubercular Hospital,"In November 1937, the State Board of Control decided to proceed with construction of a new men’s hospital building at the State Tuberculosis Hospital in Kearney. The building was estimated to cost $125,000.00, the bulk of which would be funded out of the unicameral’s “building fund” for state institutions. Officials were hopeful that they building could be completed by the fall of 1938. John Latenser and Sons, Omaha architects, were selected to prepare the plans for the building. The Latensers had experience in designing hospitals, including the University Hospital, the Douglas County Hospital, Clarkson Hospital, Lord Lister Hospital, Clearview Home and others.
In January of 1912, the hospital opened, and in 1922, the building known as the East Sun Building opened, and functioned for the next several decades until closing in 1972. It was then acquired by Kearney State College and remodeled into the West Center for business classes.",1972,"Kearney, NE",,
Nebraska,Nebraska Sanitarium at Hastings,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Nebraska_Sanitarium_at_Hastings,,,1907,Demolished,Single Building,,Hastings Sanitarium | Nebraska Sanitarium,"The Nebraska Sanitarium operated between 1894 and 1920 in College View, a suburb of Lincoln, Nebraska. It was founded by John Harvey Kellogg as a branch of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and initially housed in a large frame dwelling north of the Union College campus. In the late 1890s, the college was facing a financial crisis due to a dramatic decrease in students. Since the sanitarium was growing, it leased North Hall, one of the college’s dormitories, in 1899 for $1,250 a year. The purpose of the sanitarium, as with other Adventist sanitariums, was to provide a place of healing while also teaching patients and students how to live healthful lives through natural means.
Located on the north end of Union’s rural campus, the Nebraska Sanitarium was away from the city but close enough to draw attention to its work. The spacious lawn was equipped with swinging lawn chairs. In 1905 the sanitarium purchased the property for $17,800, giving the college the means to build a men’s dormitory. In addition, the grove behind the facility was leased jointly to the college and the sanitarium by the Central Union Conference to become a park and outdoor gymnasium.
A branch operation, using the same name, was opened in Hastings, Nebraska in 1908, along with a nurses’ training school that enrolled an average of 20 students a term. The Hastings branch was financially self-sufficient, even though it also did a great amount of charity work. Its patronage peaked at 700 in 1916-1917 but by 1920 had dropped to 215. The peak years of operation for the sanitarium were 1915 and 1916 when it served 2500 patients each year with its 80 rooms.
In the years immediately after World War I, patronage at the sanitarium diminished while attendance at Union College increased. In 1920, the college president, H.A. Morrison, reported a severe shortage of dorm space. Acquisition of the sanitarium enabled the college to meet this need at a cost of $65,000. Thus the Nebraska Sanitarium building was converted back to a dormitory in 1920.14 It was hoped that the sanitarium would be able to find another place to operate.15 A plan to return the building to the sanitarium after the 1920-1921 school year did not work out, and it never reopened.",1920,"Hastings, NE",,
Nebraska,Lincoln Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lincoln_Sanitarium,,,1908,Demolished,Single Building,,Everett Sanitarium,"The Nebraska Sanitarium, which cost $30,000 to construct, opened in December 1908.  The three story, 65 feet tall frame building included a basement and an open porch on three sides.  The building contained e-ray equipment, several homeopathic treatment rooms and an operating room.  There was room for 30 patients, many of whom stayed for several weeks receiving treatments. For several years the Nebraska Sanitarium was the only hospital in Hastings and treated non-Adventists as well as church members.
When the Mary Lanning Hospital became fully operational in 1920,  the number of Sanitarium patients fell from an average of 700 a year to only 215.  The building was sold in 1928 to Carl Pratt who used it as a private business college, then during World War II it was converted to apartments. The building was demolished in 1986 by Peace Lutheran Church for a parking lot.",1928,"Lincoln, NE",,
