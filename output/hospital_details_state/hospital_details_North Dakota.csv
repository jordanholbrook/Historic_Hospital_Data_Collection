North Dakota,Jamestown State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jamestown_State_Hospital,1883,,1885,Active,Cottage Plan,,North Dakota Hospital for the Insane | North Dakota State Hospital,"The North Dakota State Hospital at Jamestown is one of two state institutions that predate statehood. Its location and mission as a ""hospital for the insane"" was authorized by the Dakota Territorial Legislature in 1883 and it opened on May 1, 1885, accepting its first two patients from Morton County. Fifty-eight patients whose addresses were in what eventually became North Dakota were moved to Jamestown from the Dakota Hospital in Yankton (now South Dakota). The first superintendent was Dr. O. Wellington Archibald, who had been an assistant surgeon at Fort Abraham Lincoln south of Mandan. By the end of 1886, the average daily census was 106 patients.
But by 1892, conditions at the hospital were so crowded that attics were used for sleeping rooms and even then, patients had to sleep two to a bed, VanBeek wrote. Archibald warned the Legislature that if it didn't appropriate more money for adequate care, the hospital would be closed and each county would have to care for its own insane. He left the hospital in 1894.
By 1904, the census had risen to an average of 401 and still there were no additional buildings. Two buildings had been started in 1903 but construction was halted when the funding process was found unconstitutional, wrote VanBeek. When the state began enforcing laws that allowed it to collect fees from patients' families or their home counties, the construction started again and the two new buildings were completed. Staff was increased so that patients would not have to be locked in their rooms at night or restrained during the day.
The census continued to rise, leaping from 538 in 1908 to 819 in 1912 and then to 1,288 by 1920, wrote VanBeek. In 1914, the hospital was almost closed down because of a smallpox epidemic. Also in 1914, the hospital began to routinely sterilize its ""inmates,"" due to the common belief that their ""deficient and degenerate mentality"" would be handed down to any progeny. Sterilization was carried out on female patients for many years.
Policies were adopted in the 1920s that were designed to relieve overcrowding by improving patient care. It was hoped the changes would lead to shorter stays and more discharges. The policies included plans for after-care and preparing patients' families for release. Still the census went up, reaching 1,486 in 1929.
During the 1940s, the hospital census continued to rise, reaching 2,027. It was so crowded that VanBeek writes that the institution went through a Dark Ages period, with treatment stifled by the conditions, lack of qualified staff and ""general hospital-wide disorganization.""
The American Psychiatric Association was brought in to inspect the hospital in 1949. Inspectors made many expensive recommendations, which reached the 1951 Legislature. It's not clear what was done in 1951, but in 1953, the next session increased hospital appropriations, The Forum reported
Then came a period of great reform, under Dr. R.O. Saxvik, who was ""loaned"" to the hospital from the state Health Department for six years, beginning in 1953. When he took the position, the census was 2,136 and he found chaotic administration, employee confusion, overworked staff and unrest, VanBeek writes.
By 1956, Saxvik had positive news in his biennial report. ""In three years time one can see and feel the difference,"" he wrote. ""Gone are the cages, strait jackets, leg irons, stern guards, malnutrition, windowless seclusion rooms, unorganized departments, the sixty-hour work week, the naked despondent patient on a back ward, the odors from wards crammed with untidy and helpless men and women, the tuberculosis patients in disorganized treatment areas, the neglected surgical problems and the bedlam of disturbed units,"" he wrote in one breathless sentence.
In the 1950s, the hospital began widespread use of tranquilizers on patients to relieve their anxiety and stress. Under Saxvik, the census dipped to 1,886. The 1957 Legislature appropriated money to raze two old buildings. As reforms continued, the hospital received a full three-year accreditation from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals in 1961. An adolescent unit was founded in 1963.
One of the best known superintendents, Dr Hubert Carbone, stayed for 16 years, resigning in 1979. By that time, the state had begun moving toward a treatment model that continues today, in which long-term placement in the hospital is discouraged in favor of outpatient treatment in the patients' home areas through the services of the regional human service centers, the use of advanced psychotropic drugs and the regional intervention services. In 1974, the census was 557 patients and the average stay was 60 to 90 days.
The VanBeek history, updated through 1998 by Nancy Schulz, does not give much history of the development of the physical plant, but the campus continued to grow, with many buildings added or replaced, as recently as the 1980s, when the secure forensic unit and Lahaug buildings were dedicated. Meanwhile, the population continued to dip - down to 270 in 1989 - and wards in many of the older building were closed.
By 1997, with many of the hospital's buildings empty or nearly empty and the State Penitentiary in Bismarck fairly bursting at the seams with excess inmates, the Legislature appropriated money to turn three State Hospital buildings into the James River Correctional Center, a medium-security prison on the grounds of the hospital. The two institutions are co-existing on the hill south of Jamestown today. Plans in 2020 call for a request for proposals for the new State Hospital construction project spring of 2021 with construction beginning in the spring of 2022, Etherington said.

North Dakota,North Dakota Tuberculosis Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=San_Haven_State_Hospital,1909,,1912,Closed,Single Building,,San Haven Tuberculosis Sanitarium | San Haven State Hospital,"North Dakota law created the North Dakota Tuberculosis Sanitarium in 1909 to care for persons afflicted with tuberculosis. Originally known as the North Dakota Tuberculosis Sanitarium (later Sanatorium), the hospital was governed by a Board consisting of the Governor, the Superintendent of the State Board of Health, a member of the Public Health Laboratory, and two members appointed by the Governor. In 1911, the governing Board chose Dunseith in Rolette County as the home for this facility. The choice of Dunseith on the south slope of the Turtle Mountains was selected because of the higher altitude, less snowfall, drier atmosphere, and favorable conditions for patients with tuberculosis. The facility opened to patients in November of 1912. In 1915, financial support of the Sanatorium came from the legislature, private paying patients, or from the patientâ€™s local county funds.
Patients from Grafton and other institutions were transferred to the San Haven facility in the late 1950s, and in 1957 a building was remodeled to include the developmentally disabled and the elderly. Also in 1957 the State Legislature directed the State Department of Health and the State Health Planning Council to seek out federal funding for the construction of a tuberculosis sanitarium in Grand Forks with the cooperation of North Dakota State Medical Center at University of North Dakota. Later legislation directed the State Medical Center to continue to work with the existing Sanatorium at San Haven.
A Mental Health Authority within the State Health Department was established. The section of San Haven that housed the School for the Feeble Minded was under the authority of the Grafton State School. The 1961 legislature authorized the Board of Administration to transfer patients from Grafton State School to San Haven.  In the 1960s the Grafton State School like other U.S. facilities of developmentally disabled reached a peak population of 1,300 who were served daily at the facilities of Grafton and the School at San Haven.
In 1971, the North Dakota Tuberculosis Sanatorium was referred to as San Haven State Hospital. Several legislative changes took place in 1973. San Haven became a division of the Grafton State School, however, San Haven continued to treat patients with tuberculosis. The superintendent at Grafton State School also served as the superintendent of the San Haven State Hospital and appointed an assistant superintendent to manage San Haven. In 1973 the Director of Institutions was authorized to discontinue operations at the tuberculosis sanatorium and was to transfer responsibility for the care of patients with tuberculosis to the State Department of Health. Increasingly patients with tuberculosis were either inpatients or outpatients at general hospitals and were treated by physicians of their own choice. Finally, the state leased a portion of the land at San Haven to the Dunseith Park Board to be used as a golf course or for other recreational purposes.
A new section of the Century Code related to new methods of care for persons with tuberculosis. The State Health Officer under the guidelines of the State Health Council was responsible for the care of the patients. The care of those with tuberculosis at San Haven was phased-out and the San Haven facility was to only provide custodial care for the developmentally disabled. Until 1979 the assistant superintendent acted as both the chief of staff and chief of the medical staff and this became two separate positions.
State resources did not cover the all of the costs for maintaining the facilities at San Haven and questions concerning adequate care of the developmentally disabled arose. This brought about a lawsuit in 1980 between the North Dakota Association for Retarded Citizens and the State of North Dakota. The court-ordered changes modernized the custodial system and gave the developmentally disabled residents an opportunity to live in their own communities. In December of 1987 San Haven State Hospital closed. The facility stood vacant in 1989 and the legislature in 1991 authorized the director of the Office of Management and Budget to sell, lease, exchange, or transfer the title of San Haven properties. Any funds realized from the transaction would be deposited in the general fund.  In 1992 the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribe purchased from the State of North Dakota the San Haven property.",1987,"Dunseith, ND",,
North Dakota,Grafton State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Grafton_State_School,1903,,1904,Active,Cottage Plan,Hancock Brothers & Joseph Bell DeRemer,Institution for the Feeble-Minded | North Dakota Developmental Center | Developmental Center at Westwood Park | Life Skills & Transition Center (Current),"The North Dakota Developmental Center dates back to 1903 when the legislature allocated funds for a facility to educate and care for people with mental retardation (intellectual and developmental disabilities). The site of the new campus, 40 acres in size, was located on the west side of Grafton and had been
owned by the state for more than a decade. When the property of the Dakota Territory was divided at statehood, North Dakota was deemed to be ""entitled"" to some facility worth $30,000 to balance a new penitentiary wing just completed in Sioux Falls. Congress appropriated the money in 1891 and the Department of the Interior had already purchased the land for $3,000 before anyone awoke as to what was going on. With an adequate penitentiary in Bismarck, the young state had no desire for a second such institution and the money was banked until 1901 by which time it had grown to $29,000. It was these funds which were used to pay for the erection of the Main Building, plus architects 7 fees and the cost of drilling an artesian well. It was necessary to wait until the 1903 legislature made available new funds that such tasks as plastering, ventilating and fitting the building for occupancy were accomplished. Even so, it was necessary to tap the maintenance fund for $10,000 before the school was ready to open.
The board hired Dr. L. B. Baldwin, assistant director of the State Hospital for the Insane at
Jamestown, as the first superintendent and he began his duties on December 16, 1903. Baldwin's first job was to get the unfurnished building ready to open and he did so, expecting an initial population of 50. But in May 1904 no less than 75 ""eligible applicants for admission"" arrived from the State Hospital in Jamestown
and within a month Gov. White signed an executive order sending another 27 residents, 14 of whom were epileptic. Thus the new institution opened in an overcrowded condition, setting a theme which was to continue for more than half a century. Starting in May 1904, people were admitted directly from communities and were transferred from the North Dakota State Hospital to the new facility in Grafton, N.D.
Agriculture also played an important role in the early development of the campus since the institution was expected to grow much of its food in order to keep expenses down. The first year Baldwin hired out the farming due to troubles in getting the institution started up as well as a lack of suitable equipment. In
fact, he saw the farm not only as a food source but also an integral part of the institution's training program. ""All the vegetables consumed should be raised on the premises,"" he wrote, ""thus affording outdoor occupation for a portion of the male inmates.""
In 1924 Wylie called for plans and long-term policies to house up to 1,000 patients, an estimated ten percent of the state's developmentally disabled population.
At this time the school's population was 424, with at least 37 females on the waiting list. The overcrowding was also a function of the continued multiple uses of the Main Building. Despite repeated entreaties, Wylie could not persuade the state to build a separate superintendent's cottage, a move which would have freed
space for classrooms.
Originally known as the Institution for the Feeble-Minded, the name was changed in the 1930's to Grafton State School to recognize the training emphasis at the facility. In the early 1960's the North Dakota Tuberculosis Sanitarium near Dunseith, N.D., became a satellite facility. Like most facilities in the United States for people with developmental disabilities, the Grafton State School reached its peak population in the late 1960s. At that time, about 1,300 people were served per day through the San Haven and Grafton locations. Admissions decreased and population levels began to fall when special educational services became available in school districts starting in the late 1960s/early 1970's.
Inadequate resources made it difficult to maintain buildings and adequately address overcrowding and service concerns. The North Dakota ARC initiated a lawsuit in Federal District Court. In 1982, a United States District Court ruling in the case of the Association for Retarded Citizens of North Dakota, et al., vs. State of North Dakota, resulted in substantial, court-ordered changes to North Dakota's service system for people with developmental disabilities. The San Haven location closed in 1989, and the state has significantly expanded opportunities for people with developmental disabilities to live, to work and to participate in their home communities. The Center earned accreditation from The Council on Quality Services for People with Disabilities in 1989 and has sustained that accreditation. Court review ended in 1995.
Since 2000, the Developmental Center's population has ranged from 160 to 117 people with developmental disabilities. Current plans are to continue to decrease the number of people served in the Developmental Center ICF/MR residential services. The agency is now a Licensed Provider for HCBS residential and day services and has added an ICF/MR Adolescent Service component to address the needs of adolescents unable to be served by private provider services. CARES was established in 1994 and added direct support outreach capabilities in 2008, and joins with the Institute services of the agency to assist local and statewide professional needs.",,"Grafton, ND",Classic Revival & Art Deco,"1,450 in 1966"

However Eljiah Boley, a Morton County Commissioner and area landowner had another plan.  In 1895 he deeded 40 acres of land for a site for this institution and with an additional 160 acres to be purchased from him at $10 per acre. However, the deed was later cancelled when frictions arose and the former Fort Lincoln site was proposed.  Eventually, the current location was approved by the ND Legislature in 1901 and the facility was first opened to students on May 13, 1903.
Since then, this facility has served as the Stateâ€™s center of juvenile justice administration and operation under such names as the North Dakota State Reform School in 1903, North Dakota State Training School in 1920, the North Dakota Industrial School in 1961 and the North Dakota Youth Correctional Center (YCC) in 1995.
In 1938, the ND State Training School, was the only youth correctional center in the nation to offer high school classes, and only one of four in the US to house both boys and girls. Until 1947, the State Training School also served as an orphanage, especially for the children of criminals who were incarcerated.  However other children, orphaned typically through accidents or other mishaps, were also assigned there.
The current campus includes four cottages, administration and education facilities, a gymnasium with an indoor swimming pool, a chapel and a cafeteria.  By converting one cottage into a secured facility for high-risk juvenile offenders, the site avoids encompassing its campus with a wall or a fence by remodeling Pine Cottage into a security facility for high-risk juvenile offenders.[1]",,"Mandan, ND",,
