Wisconsin,Mendota Mental Health Institute,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mendota_Mental_Health_Institute,,,1860,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),,Wisconsin State Hospital for the Insane | Mendota Asylum for the Insane | Mendota State Hospital,"Mendota opened on July 14, 1860 when it admitted a patient who had been brought all the way from Oconto County...a long trip by horse and wagon. Even though the hospital was not yet ready to open, that Saturday it was decided that, because of the distance the patient had been brought, he should be received. Thus began Mendota's ready response to the needs of patients and communities, which has been its tradition.
Mendota has gone through many changes since then, some of them dramatized in the changes in its name. It opened as an ""Asylum"", appropriate in an era when little could be done for the mentally ill except to house and care for them...i.e. to give them asylum...when their families and communities could no longer cope with their needs.
In a later era, when patients were recognized as having an illness...mental illness...the name was changed to Mendota State Hospital, reflecting its responsibility for providing treatment.
In more recent times, with the discovery of psychiatric medications and with new approaches (some of which resulted from research at Mendota itself) it became possible for the mentally ill to be treated in community hospitals and clinics. But there remained a need for a place for those who required more specialized treatment than most community hospitals and clinics could provide, and where the tradition of research, education, and consultation that Mendota had already established could continue. Mendota was then changed to its present name of Mendota Mental Health Institute.
Mendota has a distinguished history as one of the most progressive psychiatric facilities in the country. It is well-known for its advanced programs. The methods for community treatment developed in Mendota's PACT program have been adopted throughout Wisconsin and many other states, as well as abroad. Agencies throughout the country contact Mendota's Home and Community Treatment program to learn its methods for helping families with disturbed children, without hospitalization.
Mendota's program in forensic psychiatry has been recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health as one of the top ten such programs in the United States. Mendota's Geropsychiatric Treatment Unit is noted for its assessment and treatment of the elderly who suffer from emotional and neurological conditions which affect behavior, including Alzheimer's Disease. But those are only a few of Mendota's programs; in all, there are 17 treatment units serving the needs of children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly as well as special forensic populations. Each has a distinguished record of achievement.
Mendota is the only facility in Wisconsin, public or private, which ever received the Gold Achievement Award of the American Psychiatric Association, the highest award possible for mental health programs in America.
Mendota was one of the first mental hospitals in the country to receive accreditation by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, which continues to accredit Mendota today. Mendota has been the ""cradle"" for the clinical education of hundreds of mental health professionals in Wisconsin and beyond. And Mendota provides for their continued education by offering regular seminars and workshops attended by about 7000 people each year.
When Mendota opened in 1860 it was the first mental hospital in Wisconsin. It held a promise of something better than this state had ever had before. It has not failed to keep that promise.

Wisconsin,Winnebago State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Winnebago_State_Hospital,,1871,1873,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),Stephen Vaughn Shipman,Winnebago Mental Health Institute | Northern Asylum for the Insane,"On the west central shore of Lake Winnebago, just north of the city of Oshkosh, lies a promontory called Asylum Point. Its surrounding waters are identified as Asylum Bay. For 125 years, the Bay has sheltered the facility which has been known as the Northern Asylum for the Insane; the Winnebago State Hospital; and Winnebago Mental Health Institute. Although its waters have been by no means always tranquil, the Institute has, throughout its history, provided many troubled individuals with a sanctuary, a refuge, and a safe place to prepare for re-entry into a turbulent world.
Winnebago Mental Health Institute (WMHI) is located on the scenic west shore of Lake Winnebago, four miles north of Oshkosh. The purchase price for the original 338 acres of land was $26,000. Construction of the Northern Hospital for the Insane (now WMHI) began in 1871. The first patient was admitted on April 21, 1873. The original building was completed on November 11, 1875, with the capacity of 500 beds.
The Kirkbride was demolished in 1966/67 to make way for newer buildings.

Wisconsin,Wisconsin Central State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wisconsin_Central_State_Hospital,1900,1909,1914,Active,Pavilion Plan,Foeller & Schober,Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane | Dodge Correctional Institution,"In 1900, the State Board of Control (the successor to the State Board of Charities and Reform) declared that ""the time has come when it should be pressed upon the attention of the Executive and Legislature that some additional facilities for the care and safekeeping of violent, dangerous and criminal insane should be provided"". At that time, the Board felt
that this could best be accomplished by erecting a building for those classes at one of the already existing state mental hospitals. The new institution could be connected with the heating, lighting, water and sewerage systems of the hospital, but be located far enough away to prevent its inmates from mingling with, or disturbing those in other buildings. These recommendations were not heeded, however, and the Board of Control had to continue to press this need for many years.
Finally, in 1909, the Wisconsin State Legislature appropriated $100,000.00 for a hospital for the criminal insane to be erected at the Northern Hospital for the Insane at Winnebago. A study was made of similar institution in other states and plans were prepared and adopted for the construction of a building to provide for present and future needs. The Board of Control discovered, however, that the amount appropriated was insufficient to contract for construction of the buildings required to meet their present needs, so no work was done. The project was delayed even further in 1911 when the Legislature decided that it was inadvisable to locate the criminal and violent insane at the same site as the general hospital for the insane at Winnebago. Provisions were made, however, for money to purchase a site for a new facility near Waupun. This facility was to be under the
jurisdiction of the Board of Control, but for the purpose of day-to-day management, it was to be considered a component part of the Wisconsin State Prison (WSP) at Waupun. The location was considered advantageous for the same reasons that it was selected for the prison: its central location to the population centers of the state, close proximity to
major railroad lines, and high quality farm lands.
On July 1, 1913, Dr. Rock Sleyster, up to that point the prison physician at the WSP, was appointed as the hospital's first director. He transferred to the facility soon after and began to equip and organize the new facility. As superintendent, Dr. Sleyster then visited and studied several other hospitals for the criminal insane in other states. At that time, only New York (which established the first two), Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio had established such specialized facilities. Dr. Sleyster specifically wanted to ""avoid the mistakes so frankly admitted by them and benefit by their experience"". To serve these purposes several steps were taken. Rooms were painted in soft shades of pink, green or blue, bars on the windows ran horizontally rather than vertically, and trees, shrubs, vines and perennials were planted to make the grounds pleasant. Also, a 18 foot concrete wall enclosing the recreation grounds at the rear of the institution was built, but in such a way as to eliminate the psychic effect of a prison wall. To accomplish this, a drained moat, approximately 15 feet deep was dug on either side of the wall (the by-product of which provided enough crushed stone for the concrete foundations of 4 or five future buildings), so that it rose only three feet above ground level.
On July 12, 1914, the first patients were admitted. The precise number is unclear, but the first ward (ward B; ward A being the administration building) appears to have had a capacity of between 35-60, each patient having his own private room. Regardless, the new facility was filled beyond capacity within one week after opening. 26 This rapid
overcrowding elicited a quick response from the State Legislature, which appropriated funds for a new ward to be constructed. Contracts were let, and a new wing was quickly constructed and occupied on January 26, 1915. This wing too, was filled within ten days by transfers from other institutions. Construction was fairly constant at CSH until the mid-1930s when the Depression, and later World War Two prevented further expansion.
Overcrowding was a persistent problem at CSH. As new wards were erected they were rapidly filled beyond capacity, with many more patients awaiting transfer from other state and county institutions. Superintendents of CSH continuously over the years asked for further appropriations to expand the facility and alleviate some of the problems. Generally, these were slow in coming and the patient population reached as much as 75% over the rate bed capacity. Under these circumstances, two patients were kept in rooms meant for one,
basements and storerooms were used as dormitories, and patients were kept in beds placed in corridors. Another problem caused by chronic overcrowding was that it prevented
proper segregation of the different grades of patients. As it was, no attempt was made to care for any of the violent or dangerous insane women that were housed in other institutions. Only male patients were accepted at CSH, as gender segregation would have been impossible, and the potential sexual contact that might have resulted between male and
female patients was unacceptable.
Upon admission to the hospital, patients were given a physical and mental exam and put under observation before a diagnosis was made. Once this was done, the patients' work capabilities were evaluated and they were assigned the job for which they were best qualified. At CSH all the farm and garden work was done by patients, as was landscape and
dormitory work. Also, patients unloaded coal from the trains and worked in the kitchen/dining room. In the carpenter shop and workshop some toys were made and then sold to visitors; the income from the sales went to the patients who made them.
The difference between this institution and those for the civil insane were supposed to be structural changes for maximum security, not treatment oriented changes. The treatment and therapy at CSH was to be similar to that of any other state mental hospital. Historically, this meant an emphasis on moral treatment. The goal was to place the patient
in a smaller hospital where he/she could receive kind and specialized care. Activities were to include occupational therapy, religious exercises, amusements and recreation. Essentially, it was ""milieu"" treatment where the patient could be re-educated in a proper moral atmosphere. Another important component was medical treatment the patients were
given. Before the evolution of the field of modern psychiatry, beliefs supported a ""sound body=sound mind"" theory; it was important to strengthen the physical condition in order to improve the mental condition. Tonics and laxatives were used frequently and a good diet was stressed. Most doctors also advocated the use of drugs, especially where behavior was particularly active or violent. Narcotics were often used to quiet patients, make them more manageable, avoid fatal exhaustion, minimized use of restraints, and prevent them from harming themselves, other patients and staff. Hydrotherapy was also usually popular in mental institutions because of its calming abilities. In 1935, the medical staff of CSH consisted of three doctors—including the medical superintendent and zero nurses.
Poor conditions and treatment at CSH continued into the 1950s and 1960s. In 1958, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals recommended against accreditation for CSH, largely on the grounds of a lack of medical personnel. The hospital did continue in operation, however, and in the late 1960s there was an attempt to change the emphasis from
custody to a more effective overall treatment program. In 1972, a committee was appointed to do a study of CSH and make recommendations. Many, including Dr. Marvin Chapman who was the Clinical Director of the facility at that time, felt that the institution should be closed down due to the massive disparities in staffing and programming, between CSH and the other state mental hospitals. It was their contention that the facility failed completely as a hospital and was simply a penal institution in every way. An influential member of the committee, however, was the Assemblyman from the local Waupun area and he lobbied strongly against closing the facility because of the large number of jobs that would be lost.
In 1983, the hospital function of the institution closed completely and the buildings became a reception facility for the Division of Corrections. Now named the Dodge Correctional Facility, all prisoners convicted in Wisconsin courts are sent there for evaluation and processing to determine which state facility they should be sent to. All remaining CSH patients were sent to either Winnebago or Mendota at that time, where special high security wards have been built. According to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections website, DCI was doubled in size in 1993. In 1996, the facility accepted its first female inmate, which made it the only facility in Wisconsin that took both male and female inmates. Though it still remains the central medical center for both males and females, the female reception center was moved to Taycheedah Correctional Institution in 2004.
Ed Gein was housed at Wisconsin Central State Hospital before being transferred to Mendota Mental Hospital. Attempted presidential assassin John Schrank was also a patient at Central State Hospital from 1912-1943 for his attempt to kill Theodore Roosevelt.
Located outside Waupun in the Township of Chester, this cemetery was the final resting place for unclaimed inmates from the Wisconsin State Prison (now Waupun Correctional Institution) and patients from Central State Hospital. It was used from 1871 to 1975. Originally, each grave had a marker bearing the grave number. In the 1980s, metal markers were installed bearing the name, number, institution, and date of death of each individual. Unfortunately, those markers have since been replaced with one large sign bearing the names and dates of death of those buried here. (The sign does not include deaths before 1898.) There are no individual markers today.

The facility was created for the treatment of mental illnesses of World War I veterans. Wisconsin ran the Memorial Hospital until 1937 and was reimbursed by the federal government for operations. Starting in 1937, the Veterans Administration leased Memorial hospital for $1 a year for treatment of mentally ill veterans. The VA returned the facility to Wisconsin in July 1948. Veteran patients were transferred to a new VA facility, Tomah Memorial Hospital, in Tomah, Wisconsin.It was known as Veterans Administration hospital, Farwell's Point during the period it was operated by the VA.
Originally, the State Memorial Hospital was not administratively part of Mendota State Hospital. The Memorial Hospital buildings came under the control of the Mendota State Hospital after the VA moved patients to Tomah and returned the facility to the state in July 1948. This was the only expansion of Mendota State Hospital from 1904 to 1952. Regaining control of the Memorial Hospital from the VA allowed the state to move patients out of the 90-year-old main building and out of upper floors while replacement facilities were constructed in the 1950s.",,"Mendota, WI",,

Because the presiding officers failed to sign it before adjournment, the bill did not become law. Various organizations continued to call attention to the need for such an institution which resulted in a bill in 1887 that passed both houses, but was vetoed by the governor. When re-introduced in 1891, the bill failed to pass both houses of the legislature. Finally, in 1895, twenty eight years after it was first introduced, the bill for a ""Wisconsin Home for the Feeble Minded"" became a law.
The name of the institution changed several times, including in 1922, when it was renamed the Northern Wisconsin Colony and Training School. As of 1976, it is known as the Northern Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled and is still used for the care of patients with developmental disabilities.",,"Chippewa Falls, WI",,"2,203 (1962)"

The Board of Controls again visited various sites, and settled on the $53,937.50 purchase of 519 acres located two miles northwest of the village of Union Grove. They chose this site due to its location in the southeastern part of the state near the cities of Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Burlington. The land for Southern Wisconsin Center was initially purchased in 1916. Construction of the first buildings for the institution, which by law was known as Southern Wisconsin Home for the Feeble-minded and Epileptics, was begun in 1918.
With some help from prisoners, housed in barracks on the grounds, building construction was carried on with much difficulty. Due to the swampy conditions of the building site, roads were almost impassable, horses and equipment were mired, and the contractor was unable to obtain building materials. Quicksand, potholes, ravines and water all contributed to the difficulties and delays.
Finally on February 14, 1919, the institution was officially opened. The first buildings included Washington Cottage (later known as Cottage 2), a residential building for girls; Roosevelt Cottage (later known as Cottage 14), originally a building for employees; the superintendent's residence (now part of Southern Oaks School for Girls); Hoard Cottage, a farm cottage for boys; a barn, and two silos. These buildings formed the nucleus from which the institution began to operate.
Washington Cottage, in addition to housing the female patients, included the Administration offices, the laundry, the bakery, the sewing room, the hospital and the school. The institution power plant and water system were located in the farm cottage. Dr. H. C. Werner, the first Superintendent, lived in the residence until 1923 at which time he was succeeded by Dr. C. C. Atherton.
Early in 1922, the building program began to expand. Adams Cottage (Cottage 4), Jefferson Cottage (Cottage 5), Madison Cottage (Cottage 6), a refectory (dining hall) and a power plant were under construction at this time. These buildings were completed but not occupied for quite some time due to the lack of heat, light and power. As a temporary expedient two large boilers, one located east of Cottage 4 and one between Cottages 5 and 6, were installed outside. Tar paper shacks were built over the boilers to protect them from the elements. These temporary boilers were connected to the heating equipment in the new buildings, to supply heat to keep them from freezing and deteriorating until permanent boilers and engines could be installed in the new power plant. By August 1924 the new power plant was completed and heat, light and power was connected by steam conduit to the new buildings, allowing occupancy. Wooden sidewalks were constructed and laid between the new residential buildings and the refectory.
In 1921 the legal name of the institution was changed from ""The Southern Wisconsin Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptics"", suggestive of an asylum or almshouse, to ""Southern Wisconsin Colony and Training School"". This reflected the changing attitude regarding the developmentally disabled. For many years the accepted philosophy of social workers was based on the belief that the most that could be done for people with developmental disabilities was to provide them with comfortable quarters and train them to adjust to institution living. Gradually it was realized that the developmentally disabled could be educated and trained to do useful work, and become contributing members of society. Acceptance of this philosophy created a realization that the function of the institution was to educate and train rather than just provide food, clothing, shelter and little more.
Once the power plant was finished in 1924, other buildings were constructed at a rapid pace. A new employees' building was opened for occupancy in spring of 1925. This building was constructed in a lowland which was filled with approximately 3 to 3 1/2 feet of field rocks, covered by approximately a foot and a half of dirt. A new laundry and a horse barn were also completed in 1925. The horses were moved into the new barn from the east wing of the dairy barn, which allowed for the installation of calf pens in the area vacated. Patient labor was utilized in the operation of both the farm and the dairy facilities. The use of patient labor served a dual purpose; primarily it provided a form of training in tasks which would prepare the patient for eventual discharge and secondly, the labor was badly needed in the planting, tending and harvesting of crops and production of dairy products which were used extensively in the kitchen throughout the institution. In 1925, after Buildings 4, 5, 6, the laundry, and the refectory were opened and occupied, the bakery was moved from Building 2 to the new refectory and laundry equipment was moved to the new laundry.
The Depression era brought about many efforts to cut expenditures to a bare minimum, without sacrificing essential patient services. Stories were related by former employees at the time of using pencils down to a 1"" stub, which then needed to be turned in before a new pencil would be issued. Stationary costs were reduced by the use of the back sides of memoranda and letters for the reply, or even for the issuance of new communications. But the building expansion continued.
During 1928 the greenhouse was built, complete with a heating unit. The hog house was enlarged to contain twelve more pens and a slaughter house was added on the west end. At this same time a new Hospital and Infirmary (later renamed Cottages 12 and 13), and Building 1 (Lincoln Cottage) were under construction. In the construction of the Hospital and Infirmary, just enough black dirt was taken off the surface to get down to hard solid soil for foundation footings. After the concrete foundations were poured, they were 9' out of the ground on the west side and 9 ½' on the east side. After the completion of these buildings it required 44,000 yards of dirt to complete the filling to its present grade. These buildings were opened for occupancy in early 1930.
The following progress was made in 1932: a complete telephone system was installed with a central on-grounds switchboard; nine garages were built to house the institution trucks and cars; a bull house with an exercise yard was completed; the north and south gate pillars were erected; and the service building, housing a carpenter shop and a machine shop, was completed. In 1933 a dairy building , machine shed, and a blacksmith shop were constructed with the aid of C.W.A. workers. Construction on the new granary was started in the fall of 1934, and completed with the help of W.P.A. in 1935.
In the spring of 1936 construction was started on Building 3 (Grant Cottage) with a connecting link to Building Four (Adams Cottage), which housed a central kitchen. A kitchen and dining room between Building 5 (Jefferson Cottage) and Building 6 (Madison Cottage) was also under construction at this time. Prior to the new dining rooms and kitchens, patients had to walk to their meals in all kinds of weather. The patients who could not walk had to have their meals carried from the central refectory back to the wards, where it usually arrived in a less than palatable condition. The new kitchens and dining facilities were completed, equipped, and occupied in the early spring of 1938.
The lack of manpower created by World War II caused many difficulties in the operation of the institution. These difficulties were eased considerably by the hiring of ""conscientious objectors"". Many of these individuals objected to military duty on religious grounds, and very few of them had any training in the care of people with developmental disabilities. The lack of training was overcome by the devotion to duty of the workers and their willingness to work long hours.
In January, 1944, the institution employees living in the employee building were moved out so it could be used for tubercular patients. The Hotel Shepard in Union Grove (now known as the Hotel Chartier) was leased for three years by the State and redecorated to be occupied by a large number of the vacated employees. Construction of a T.B. building was completed by the end of the year, but it was at first used as a new employee building. At the expiration of the Hotel lease, the T.B. patients were moved into the new building and the employees were all moved back into the original employees buildin
Construction of additional facilities was suspended during the war, however a great deal of planning for the future was done during this period. In 1950 Wilson Cottage (Cottage 7) was opened as a temporary facility for educable boys. In 1951 construction was started on ""Central Building"". This building, consisting of Jackson Cottage (Cottage 8), McKinley Cottage (Cottage 9), Cleveland Cottage (Cottage 10), and Taft Cottage (Cottage 11), was completed in 1954. Cottages 8 and 9 were occupied by totally dependent boys, while Cottages 10 and 11 were occupied by totally dependent girls.
Atherton Hall, named after the deceased superintendent, was completed in 1954. This building (currently The Robert E. Ellsworth Southeastern Women's Center) was designed to house 250 employees. In 1957, the west wing of Atherton was converted to be used by the Administrative Offices. Many other projects were either completed, started or planned during the mid 50's. Plans were made for the school building (CRSP) in 1954, and construction was completed in 1957. Contracts were awarded for a 100,000 gallon water tower and the institution roads were surfaced during this period.
During the winter of 1961-1962 an outbreak of Shigella Dysentary occurred which attracted nationwide attention. Numerous reporters, representing newspapers throughout the country, and representatives of the major press services descended on the institution. Thousands of words regarding the epidemic were written and broadcast on both radio and television. Plans for the new 120 bed hospital were accelerated and ground was broken for the new building in the Fall of 1962. Wallace Hospital initially consisted of a reception center, an intensive care unit, a sub-acute unit, a chronic care unit, an isolation unit, and a physical medicine and rehabilitation unit. The services provided included medical, surgical and pathology services; nursing services; radiology; EEG-EKG; pharmacy; clinical laboratory; occupational therapy; physical therapy; nursing education; medical records and dental services.[1]",,"Union Grove, WI",,

In 1959 some of the boys were transferred to the new Wisconsin School for Boys at Wales, which later became known as the Ethan Allen School. The Wisconsin School for Boys at Waukesha finally closed on August 21, 1962, and its population was transferred to the Kettle Moraine Boys School near Plymouth in Sheboygan County, which served as a juvenile correction facility until 1974.

Wisconsin,National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=National_Asylum_for_Disabled_Volunteer_Soldiers,1865,,1867,Preserved,Cottage Plan,Henry Koch & Edward Townsend Mix,Northwestern Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers,"The National Soldiers Home Historic District, in Milwaukee, is the birthplace of federal veteran care in America and is a soldiers’ recuperation and living settlement established just after the Civil War. This 90-plus acre district rests on the grounds of the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee between what is now National Avenue and Bluemound Roads, directly west of Miller Park.
The National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, as it was originally named, was established in 1865. The establishment of a system of National Soldiers Homes, including Milwaukee, was one of the last pieces of legislation signed by President Lincoln before his assassination. In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln had asked the nation “to care for him who shall have borne the battle.” These words and the persistence of many citizens including women from Milwaukee’s Soldiers Aid societies, mark the beginning of the mission of the present-day Department of Veterans Affairs.
It was the ladies of Milwaukee’s West Side Soldiers Aid Society—already operating a hospital on Plankinton Avenue in Milwaukee—who led, and paid a big portion of the way toward Milwaukee’s Soldiers Home. Inspired by President Lincoln’s charge, the ladies organized a 10-day fair in June 1865 to raise money for a permanent Wisconsin Soldiers Home. They raised more than $100,000 and were persuaded to turn their assets over to the federal government. The women stipulated that the Milwaukee property would not have exclusions and, specifically, would admit federal veterans from all conflicts to a home that would be used solely for the care of soldiers. In May 1867, the first 36 soldiers moved into what came to be known as the “Old Soldiers Home.”
Following the organization of the Soldiers Home system, a National Board of Managers designated the first branches: an Eastern branch in Maine; a Central Branch in Ohio; and the Northwestern Branch in Milwaukee, Wis. Today, the Northwestern Branch is the VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, also known as The National Soldiers Home Historic District.
The district remains unique, not only in its welcoming history but in its literal standing. The Milwaukee Soldiers Home campus is the only one of the three original sites to have its majestic Soldiers Home intact, and it is also the only one with the majority of its surrounding recuperative village remaining. The Soldiers Home walls and grounds and memories depict the history not only of veteran care but also of nursing home and institutional care in America. The National Soldiers Home Historic District is listed on both the National and State Registers of Historic Places and is under current consideration for National Landmark status.
In all, the National Soldiers Home Historic District houses 25 post-Civil War and turn-of-the 20th Century buildings as well as the oldest two-thirds of Wood National Cemetery and dozens of park-like acres. The most historically significant and architecturally dominant building is the site’s namesake, the Soldiers Home (Bldg. 2), or “Old Main,” as veterans nicknamed her. Designed by Milwaukee architect Edward Townsend Mix, Old Main was completed in 1869 and was a domiciliary with long rooms, common foyers and sitting rooms. Though used for veteran housing until the 1970s, the basic interior design remains as it was in 1869.
Thomas Budd Van Horne, Civil War chaplain and well-known landscape architect, designed the grounds and cemetery in a Picturesque style. He used the varied topography of the campus to create curving paths and roads lined with trees and a relaxing, scenic setting. Van Horne left portions of the campus as naturally wooded areas, but created manicured lawns and formal flowerbeds immediately surrounding the buildings. The northern and eastern portions of the campus were left for farming use. Milwaukee did not have an urban park system at the time the Northwestern Branch opened. The grounds became a place for the community to visit -- for picnics, strolls, band concerts, dancing at the dance hall, Fourth of July celebrations, and rowing boats on the lake.
Such a setting was designed to heal not only the body but the soul, and the heart of the district’s serenity rests in the 1889 Home Chapel (Bldg 12). The 7,000-square foot Chapel has been a place of prayer, refuge, and true patriotism and has stood as silent sentry over the fallen. It was constructed by Wisconsin veterans and citizens with money raised from Soldiers Home Post Funds, personal donations, and Posthumous Funds. It opened September 22, 1889, as a multi-denominational chapel with seating for 600, one of the first such facilities built on federal government land and reportedly the first in Wisconsin.
Milwaukee architect and Civil War veteran Henry Koch designed many of the Soldiers Home buildings including the Chapel and the site’s celebrated Ward Memorial Hall (Bldg. 41) or Ward Theater—listed individually on the National Register. Completed in 1881, the playhouse was a popular stop for minstrel shows, vaudeville, variety acts and drama. Entertainers included Will Rogers, Bob Hope, George Jessel, Burns and Allen, Sophie Tucker, Ethel Merman, Nat King Cole, and Liberace. One of the first theaters in Wisconsin, Ward Memorial Hall served as a theater and an amusement hall, restaurant, home store, and post office. A ticket window served rail passengers. Most prominent, especially when lit at night, is the large stained-glass equestrian portrait of General Ulysses S. Grant on the east side of the Theatre, installed in 1887, a gift from the people of St. Louis and Grand Army of the Republic.
For much of its life, the Soldiers Home village revolved around the Headquarters Building (Bldg. 1), built in 1896. Today, it is home to the Soldiers Home Foundation, Friends of Reclaiming Our Heritage, Poppy Sales and American Legion and VFW offices. On the other end of the village is the Hospital and Convalescent Wards (Bldg. 6), built in 1879. Originally, it housed only elderly Civil War Veterans, the beginnings of federal nursing home care in America. Amenities included four sun parlors and a tuberculosis porch. Also prominent is the Wadsworth Library (Bldg. 3), built in 1891. The library remains open as a quiet place for veterans to read, study, and contemplate under the beauty of an original skylight. The library is the best-preserved of the primary historic district village buildings.
There are dozens of other historically significant buildings in the Soldiers Home village—from the gable-roofed Surgeon’s & Adjutant’s Quarters (Bldg. 17), built in 1887, to 1880s cream brick Barracks and a 1894 Recreation Hall (Bldg. 4) built from Post Funds to such maintenance buildings as the 1883 Fire Engine House (Bldg. 11), the 1895 Power Plant (Bldg 45), the Commissary Warehouse/Quartermaster’s Storehouse or “Stone Barn,” (Bldg. 20), erected in 1896 and renovated in 1938 as well as Quonset huts erected in the 1940s. The Governor’s Residence (Bldg. 39) is the oldest building on the site. Completed in 1868, it has housed the Soldiers Home’s directors for generations including the current VA director. [1]
Most prominent in the tranquil grounds is Wood National Cemetery, the final resting place of some 37,000. Since the first burial in 1871, the cemetery has become the final home for U.S. soldiers and veterans from the War of 1812 to Iraqi Freedom. The cemetery holds four Medal of Honor recipients; members of the first black federal infantry unit, the famed 54th Massachusetts; several Buffalo soldiers; and U.S. Colored Troops veterans.

Wisconsin,Veterans Hospital No. 37,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Veterans_Hospital_No._37,1905,,1919 (as a hospital),Preserved,Single Building,,Resthaven,"Resthaven has been described by a 1910 brochure writer as ""Neither a club, a hotel, or a sanatorium, but having the characteristics of all three."" Before Resthaven was built, the land atop Hickory Grove Hill was the farm of J.K. Anderson.
After opening in 1905, Resthaven operated as a plush resort for about 15 years. It was designed as a place for rest and recreation for stockholders and their families and other guests. This included services such as curative baths, a swimming pool, a solarium and a gymnasium plus Waukesha's famous waters. The décor was beautiful and extravagant. There were paintings by European artists, murals from Tiffany, rugs from the Orient, and mahogany woodwork all creating an atmosphere of comfort and elegance. The resort had its own dairy farm, a golf course, a tennis court and a huge lawn for croquet. Resthaven was built with some advanced ideas for construction including using locomotive train cinders in the wall partitions. Some very prominent men from Milwaukee and Chicago were stockholders and bondholders.
At the end of WWI, the government took over Resthaven as a hospital for veterans with 240 beds for those with mental & Nervous diseases. The Veteran's Administration ran it for a decade. In 1944 after a quarter-million dollar renovation, Resthaven began a career as atuberculosis hospital for veterans. By 1958 the TB cases dwindled, and because of new drugs, patients didn't have long hospital stays anymore. The government finally closed Resthaven in October 1958 and transferred patients to the VA at Wood and Madison.
Resthaven owed its beginning to a health fad and was closed by the effectiveness of 'wonder"" drugs. Unfortunately, the resort period in Waukesha was coming to an end just about the time Resthaven was built, so it never lived up to its great expectations. In April 1963, the building was sold to New Tribes Bible Institute, a nondenominational group that trains Christian workers for ministry to other countries. Now the Bible Institute has owned the building longer than any previous tenant. It was designated a local landmark in the 1980s.",1958,"Waukesha,WI",,

The mental health center had state licenses for three purposes: an 88-bed psychiatric hospital serving both adults and children for short-term crisis care, a 106-bed nursing home and a 64-bed facility for caring for people with developmental disabilities.

Construction began later that year and in 1895, a cornerstone was laid marking completion of the main building. The first patient was admitted December 26, 1895. By the end of 1896 they had a population of 110 patients. In 1877 the county decided to build a poor farm to house their indigents. By 1901 it was decided to abandon the farm & build a new home on asylum grounds. The county home was completed by 1902. Due to the increasing number of patients in 1930, a new home was built to house 60 patients. The old building was converted to be used by trusty insane male patients. In 1945 total patient capacity had reached 435, although actual population exceeded that number.
By 1950 it was decided to change the institutions name to ""Chippewa County Hospital & Home"". In 1967 the Chippewa County Board chose to build a new nursing home to house some of the old County Hospital's geriatric patients. The building was completed in 1970 with the first patient being admitted May 10, 1971. The name for the new building was ""Golden Age Home"" and had 193 beds. In October of 1974, the County Board voted to construct a new 160-bed building to replace the old County Home structure. The old

Wisconsin,Clark County Insane Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Clark_County_Insane_Asylum,1917,,1922,Active,Single Building,Claude & Starch,Clark County Asylum | Clark County Hospital | Clark County Health Care Center | Clark County Rehabilitation and Living Center,"The Clark County Board appointed a committee in 1917 for the purpose of exploring the feasibility of constructing a county asylum. Members of the committee were the Messrs. Rush, Wilding, Brooks, Royer, and Weaver. Mr. Royer was selected chairman. The committee's report at a special meeting of the County Board on April 15, 1918, was read by Mr. Wilding and was favorable to the construction.
Mr. Braebner and Mr. M. J. Tappins, members of the State Board of Control, addressed the Board in regard to asylum conditions in the State, and the need for a facility in this area. In the fall session, it was resolved to accept the option of the State. Material and labor conditions at this time were affected by World War i. The Board decided to begin construction when these conditions returned to normal. The Asylum Committee visited the Chippewa County Asylum, among others, in October of 1918. They found them to meet their expectations, as these institutions were filled to capacity and making a financial profit.
On April 17, 1919, the Board resolved that it accept the proposal of the State Board of Control and build an asylum building to be commenced in 1920. Judge 0. W. Schoengarth addressed the Board in regard to the number of insane and feebleminded patients in Clark County and the number committed to institutions each year.
The Chairman of the County Board appointed the following to serve on the Committee on Options for a site for the county asylum: Supervisors Royer, Jacques, Brooks, Young and Verkuilen. Their responsibility was to procure options, including price, on a parcel of land not less than 640 acres, suitable for the erection of a county asylum and for agricultural purposes. In August of 1919, the Committee met on the proposed sites; two near Neillsville, Wisconsin; two near Bright, Wisconsin; and two near Owen, Wisconsin. They asked the State Board of Control to look at the sites to see if they were acceptable.
The State Board of Control examined the six proposed sites. The Bright farm sites were found undesirable from the standpoint of elevation, fertility and drainage. The other four sites were acceptable. The examiner pointed out that Taylor, Price, Ashland, Rusk, Sawyer and Washburn Counties are north and northwest of Clark County and that these counties did not have an asylum. The Owen site had direct rail connections, which would provide convenient transportation for patients from these counties. After a careful study of all sites, it was unanimously agreed by the Committee to recommend to the County Board that the location be either, or both, of the sites near Owen.
There was a slight conflict between the northern and southern parts of the County concerning the site of the asylum. The southern part of the County conceded, rationalizing that a northern site was a more desirable location to serve patients north of Clark County and the surrounding area.
On December 10, 1919, the Building Committee traveled to Madison to confer with the State Board as to the kind of asylum desirable for Clark County. They also inquired about the employment of a competent architect. The compensation for architects was found to be 5% of the construction costs (3% for plans and 2% for overseeing). After inquiring about the experience and reputation of various architects, the Committee selected the firm of Claude and Stark of Madison. The State Board also suggested the hiring of an experienced insane asylum superintendent to assist in directing the preparation of plans, construction of buildings and preparing the asylum farm for occupancy. It was important that the farm be in proper productive condition by the time the buildings were completed so that it could meet the needs of the asylum and have on hand the needed provisions for the first year.
Mr. M. H. Duncan, for many years the Superintendent of the Marathon County Asylum, was highly recommended. The Committee, on this advice, went to Wausau to inspect the Asylum and entered into an agreement with Mr. Duncan. In a special session of the County Board held on December 18, 1919, it was agreed upon to purchase the recommended sites and issue bonds in the amount of $100,000. A tax was levied on all the assessed taxable property in the County to provide for payment of the principal and interest on the bonds. 415 acres were purchased from Mr. C. A. Johnson for $45,600, and 650 acres were purchased from Mr. Niran Withee for $58,000. This resulted in a total of 1,065 acres of land purchased at a cost of $103,600. The County Board vote on the above action was 32 for and 12 against. On January 2, 1920, the transaction was completed. The Committee made arrangements for a sidetrack from the Minneapolis-St. Paul & Saulte Ste. Marie Railroad Company and began clearing the right of way.
Mr. M. H. Duncan took charge as Superintendent on March 1, 1920. Mrs. Duncan became Matron. Mr. Duncan brought with him twelve patients from Wausau to help with the work. Farm implements and machinery were purchased from Mr. Niran Withee. It was agreed that just the foundation and the basement of the main building be constructed during 1920. The recommendation was made that $100,000 be raised for this construction. The above authorization was granted by the County Board on June 2, 1920.
The operations of the Institution began with the original twelve patients transferred from thewitheehousetothe main building. Seventy more patients were admitted by the end of July. Gradually the population increased, including fifty-five patients, who were transferred from the Northern Wisconsin Colony and Training School, Chippewa Falls, on January 4, 1933. The total population in April of 1936 was 316.
The Institution was originally established under a protective and custodial concept of providing humane care and kind treatment to mentally retarded and chronically mentally ill patients. This is emphasized by the inscription on the cornerstone, which reads, ""Dedicated to the Cause of Humanity"". One of its main purposes was to receive by transfer patients from the larger state hospitals who required long-term care. The Clark County Asylum was regarded as a home for individuals with little hope of returning to ""open society"", and did a good job in caring for custodial patients on a long-term basis.
In 1929, the name of the Institution was changed from the Clark County Asylum to the Clark County Hospital. During the early 1930's, additional wells were dug, as the original supply of water was not sufficient to provide for the needs of the institution. Hardwood logs were cut, hauled and sold to the John S. Owen Lumber Company of Owen. Wisconsin. Other logs of basswood and hemlock were sawed into lumber for repair work on institutional buildings. New fences were built and the old ones repaired.
In April of 1936, Myron G. Duncan succeeded his late father as Superintendent and Mrs. M. H. Duncan continued to act as the Matron. In an effort to increase the production of the farm, land was rented in 1936 from the Lohde and Miller Farms. Six acres of ground surrounding the main building was plotted into lawn. The clearing of additional farm land continued. Electric lines to the barns were repaired.
During 1946 - 47, a new machine shed was erected and an X-ray machine purchased. Lifting of price controls and rationing gradually increased the cost of operations. Fortunately, this was offset in part by an increase in income from farm operations. In 1948, a slaughter house was erected and many needed repairs and improvements were made to outlying buildings. A new hog house and a laboratory for the State Soil Conservation Project were erected in 1952. The following year, a new water supply was developed. A fire alarm and inter-communication system were installed. The installation of new roofs on the main building was also completed.
Contracts were awarded for an addition to the main building, consisting of a deepfreeze unit, new refrigeration, meat processing room, modern dairy unit, bakery, employees' dining room and complete modernization of the kitchen. This was completed and in use during 1954. Cafeteria style of serving patients was instituted, making possible the serving of hot food to patients at all times.
By 1956 all of the women's wards had been equipped with new dayroom furniture. A new mangle was installed in the laundry. The addition of a modern grain storage and mixing plant increased the efficiency of the farm operation. In the early part of 1957, the men's wards were equipped with new dayroom furniture, which provided a greater degree of comfort for the patients and improved the appearance of the Institution. The Hospital was fortunate in being named a beneficiary of a portion of the Max Papenfuss Estate. A portion of the money was used to purchase new tables and chairs for the patients' dining room and for ventilation and acoustics for the auditorium. Every effort was made to use the legacy for purposes which would add to the enjoyment and well-being of the patients, as this was the intent of the donor. A plaque was placed in the Institution in commemoration of the gift.
A beauty shop was added in 1958. The front entrance and porch of the main building were remodeled. This improved the appearance of the building and at the same time added two visiting rooms for patients, friends and relatives.
Contracts for new boilers, piping and ventilation were awarded in December, 1959. This project, along with a new system for filtration of the river water, was completed in early 1960. The driveways were blacktopped and new electric entrance panels and lines were installed in the boiler room and main building. Six electric stoves were installed in the kitchen and bakery and a new electric oven was added to the kitchen equipment. The new stoves and oven were made possible from the balance of the money left to the Institution from the Max Papenfuss Estate. During 1960, the part-time services of a social worker were acquired. Release plans were developed for select patients. Increased involvement with relatives of patients was now possible.
In 1961 - 62, roofs were installed on the west wing of the main building and on the power house. Plans were approved for a Superintendent's residence and construction was started. The former private quarters of the Superintendent were converted to a sewing room, medical center, dentist office and storage rooms. The moving of these services from ward areas reduced overcrowding and resulted in improved patient care. A bulk tank was installed at the main dairy barn. The barn and dairy plant were certified as Grade A by the Department of Agriculture and Markets. A new well was drilled and water system installed at the west farm; also, a milk house was built, and a can cooler added.
During 1963, the part-time services of a psychiatric consultant were acquired, which provided for the development of psychiatric-patient evaluation and therapy. The Knights of Columbus from the surrounding area presented the Hospital with an altar, confessional booth and lectern. The altar and lectern were used for services in the Hospital auditorium. A new chapel, which represented several months of cooperative planning between the Clark County Hospital staff and clergymen of all denominations, was dedicated in July, 1965. The chapel has a seating capacity of 130 people.
An occupational therapy unit, consisting of 2400 square feet of floor space, was constructed during 1965. The existing auditorium adjoins and is easily accessible to the therapy unit for larger groups taking part in recreation. A sewage treatment project was also completed during the year.
The part-time services of a trained social worker provided consultation and supervision to staff, as well as services to patients and their families. On July 1, 1967, counseling and diagnostic services were made available to residents of Clark County through the Wood County Mental Health Services, Marshfield, Wisconsin. By a contractual agreement between Clark County and the Wood County Mental Health Services, consultation became available by special appointment at the Clark County Hospital.
The services of two additional agencies providing evaluation and/or training in social and vocational experiences for long-term retarded patients were utilized: Marshfield Rehabilitation Workshop and Development Evaluation Center, Central Wisconsin Colony and Training School. The number of patients on various programs administered by county departments of social services rose markedly. The Hospital began to develop a working relationship with the Clark County Department of Social Services, as well as with other like agencies in other counties.
The enclosing of the twelve porches and remodeling of former employee quarters provided for an additional 75 beds. This was not done to serve more patients, but to release overcrowding and, therefore, more adequately serve the existing population. The former employee quarters became an intensive treatment 15-bed unit, where newly admitted patients in acute distress were assigned for intensive treatment and early recovery.
In October of 1968, In-Service Training classes were initiated for all ward personnel. Every ward employee was scheduled to attend classes for one hour a week. Patient care procedures were taught with visual aids printed material and lectures. Resource personnel were involved. Follow-up observation on the wards was also accomplished by the instructor. Nursing care plans were recorded for each patient so that care could be provided in a more uniform and consistent manner.
Pharmaceutical services were initiated. The drug room was completely remodeled, which included the installation of enclosed drug cabinets and modern work counter. A pharmacist was added to the staff of the Hospital two days per week. The old system of patient medication was replaced by an improved and much safer system of individual medication.
By 1970, the psychiatric hospital and nursing home had a full complement of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses. The efficiency of providing nursing care increased considerably with the utilization of nursing stations on each patient care unit. The P.M.I. (public medical institution) unit was now in full operation and began to show effective results. Nursing personnel assumed a supervisory role over staff involved in direct patient contact.
Activity therapy secured its first full-time Registered Occupational Therapist and the program of the Activity Therapy Department was structured to include as many patients as possible. Group recreation was offered for nearly all patients. Specialized activities were provided for regressed and non-ambulatory patients, as well as for those who were better integrated, or who had special interests. All activities were designed as an integral part of the patients s treatment. Written records of patient progress were maintained and scheduled conferences were held to program patients and review objectives.
The psychiatrist's role as a consultant to the Hospital expanded. In general, he functioned in support and collaboration with the hospital staff in carrying out its mission of affording a good program for individuals with emotional problems requiring hospitalization. Decisions were made pertaining to admission, treatment and discharge of patients. This was facilitated with interviews with each new admission by correlating social, legal, and historic data to establish a diagnostic category. Frequent interviews were held with authorities, family members and/or agency personnel. All staff was involved and assisted in working out a therapeutic program and discharge plan. Medication and varied therapeutic approaches were recommended and supervised which included individual, group, and family therapy. Rehabilitative and eventual discharge plans were reviewed. Post discharge sessions were held with the patient and interested persons. Educational programs were carried out through interviews with aides and nursing personnel.
Patients were discharged with an optimistic attitude because of the Hospital's contact and utilization of sheltered workshops and half-way houses in Marshfield and Eau Claire, as well as affiliation with the Vocational Rehabilitation Program. The Clark County contract with the Wood County Mental Health Services provided a follow-up program for patients who were discharged from the Hospital. [1]
The hospital is now currently open and running as a nursing home and rehabilitation facility that specializes in Alzheimer's and behavioral patients.",,"Owen, WI",,

The Asylum became part of the county hospital system, which was set up to provide long term care to people who were discharged from the state hospital system. In order to accommodate steadily increasing populations, the county expanded the asylum facility with several additions and renamed it the Dane County Hospital.

Mr John Charles of  Mineral Point , WI was selected to prepare plans for the building. Within a month the asylum site was selected and purchased from the Knapp, Stout & Co. for $6000.00. Hackworthy and Hoeser, contractors from Appleton, WI were selected to construct the building on their bid of $35,783.00. Plumbing and gas were done for $2,480.00 by J.A. Trane of La Crosse, WI. Local contractor F.E. Peas constructed the root cellar, laundry and ice house for $2000.00. Heating and lighting were contracted for $7, 405.00. Last but not least ""Sanitary Closets"" and two ""Vented Urinals"" were purchased at the cost of $900.00.
The asylum was situated 1 1/2 miles east of  Menomonie.  The extreme length of the building was 235 feet and the width 120 feet. It was heated by hot water , lighted by gas and had a thorough system of ventilation. No asylum in the state was more complete in all of its appointments for the care and comfort of the patients. The building had four wards for the insane and could care for 117 patients.
The Dunn County Insane Asylum first patient was received on February 10, 1892. It cost less than $3.00 per week to maintain a patient in the asylum. By October of 1892 there were 111 patients in the asylum, 48 from Dunn County. There were no in house Doctors , but local doctor , Dr. N.L. Howison , would visit twice a week and was on call for any emergencies. It soon became a self-supporting institution with its own farm, producing more than needed, the extra milk, and farm crops were sold to local markets. Three men were employed on the farm and in the summer were assisted by trustworthy patients to care for the animals or work in the field and garden.  In 1924 there was a net profit of $4,412.43 from farm and garden produce.
The name Asylum was changed to Dunn County Hospital in 1947. Then in 1972 a new building was erected under the name Dunn County Health Care Center.

Wisconsin,La Crosse County Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=La_Crosse_County_Asylum,,1887,1888,Demolished,Single Building,,La Crosse County Hospital | Lakeview Health Center,"Prior to the establishment of the La Crosse County Insane Asylum in 1888, those suffering mental illness were housed as inmates at the county jail. In 1871, the County board of supervisors moved to have those suffering mental illness to be transferred to a better facility. In 1887, the La Crosse County’s board of trustees allocated money for the establishment of a county insane asylum. With the funds, the county acquired a 210 acre farm 10 miles east of La Crosse (in West Salem, Wisconsin) and construction began on the hospital. In 1888, the facility opened and served 104 patients during its first year. In 1911, as the facility grew and began to house more and more patients, it became necessary to expand the building and major expansions to the 1888 building were made.
Throughout the La Crosse County Insane Asylum/County Hospital’s history, the hospital has owned and operated a farm on the hospital grounds. Patients often had specific jobs and tasks on the farm as part of their stay at the hospital. Much of the produce grown on the farm as well as the meat and dairy products raised on the farm were used for groceries for the hospital patients. The remaining stock was sold for additional hospital funding.
The 1964 Treatment Law, signed by Governor John Reynolds, proposed that the treatment of mentally ill persons in Wisconsin be improved by providing for it at the local level. Up until 1965, the attempt at curing mentally ill patients was only made in state institutions, not at the 35 county hospitals, which includes La Crosse’s. However, at the time the County Hospital was already above capacity and the challenge they faced with this new mental health law was to deal with the increase of patients and be required to hire on more staff at the county hospital, without additional funding. To offset these costs, the hospital doubled its dairy herd in 1965. In 1965, the first psychiatrist was hired on part time to the hospital’s staff. In November 1968, the County Hospital’s name was changed to Lakeview. At this time, two other county institutions had their names changed as well: Hillview Home for the aged became Hillview, and Oak Forest Sanatorium became Oak Forest.
In the early 1970s, as overcrowding at Lakeview continued to get worse, discussion began regarding whether to expand the current hospital facility or to build new. Because the cost to renovate the previous building was too great, it was decided in 1973 to build a new facility near the previous hospital in West Salem. In August 1975, the new six million dollar Lakeview facility opened. The original building was demolished in 1976. In 1987 the Lakeview farm’s cattle herd was sold off and in 1989 the 40 acre farm land was sold to the village of West Salem at $5,000 an acre for the development of an industrial park.
By 1990, La Crosse County looked at closing two of its county facilities to consolidate patients at one nursing home. This proposal suggested closing Lakeview hospital. However, there was much opposition to this proposal as the closing of Lakeview would mean closing the only special needs facility in the county and that part of the state. However, due to the substantial opposition to closing the facility, the movement was tabled in 1992 and never revisited. To accommodate for not closing Lakeview, funding and the number of beds at the facility were cut.
In 2013, the county found the 1975 Lakeview building to not be meeting its needs and passed a plan to build a new center. In October 2016, construction was completed on a new 17 million dollar Lakeview facility to replace the 1975 building. The 2016 facility is located adjacent to the old building, and is on Garland Street (which is across the street from where the 1888 facility stood). The 2016 building has the capacity to house 225 patients. The old 1975 building was purchased and demolished to create residential housing.

Tegen,Manitowoc County Mental Hospital | Manitowoc County Hospital (1949) | Manitowoc Health Care Center (1973),"William Rahr is due more credit, probably than any other man in the county, for the provision of an asylum for the care of the chronic insane of Manitowoc county. On April 18, 1884, he introduced a resolution in the county board, providing for a committee to investigate the expense of maintaining the insane of the county and the probable cost of building an asylum. Following favorable action on this resolution the necessary steps were taken and an asylum was built during the following summer. Mr. Rahr served on the first committee of investigation, later on the building committee and was the first trustee elected to the asylum board. The first board of trustees was composed of Messrs. William Rahr, John Carey, Henry Vits, Henry Goedjen and C. F. Hacker. Consequent to the resignation of William Rahr, William Lueps was appointed in his stead.
On March 26, 1884, Gustav Mueller, of Reedsville, was elected as the first superintendent of the Manitowoc county asylum. On January 17, 1885, the first patients were brought to the asylum and up to May 23rd of the same year, when the first report was made, fifty-seven patients had been given care and comfort in the asylum. Previous to that time they had been confined in the county jail, while some had been left in charge of a keeper at St. Nazianz.
In the next ten years the number of patients had increased to one hundred and thirty-four and at various times it had become necessary to make additions to the asylum. At this time William Rahr was again elected trustee and the next year, following the resignation of Gustav Mueller and wife, Henry Goedjen and his wife were elected as superintendent and matron. By this time the buildings and equipment had become entirely inadequate for the purpose. So, in the summer of 1897, complete changes were made. Parts of various buildings were remodeled, additional land was purchased, and sanitary conditions improved so that the institution was modernized in equipment and ranks with the best of its kind in the state. As a result of these changes the number of outside patients increased from sixty-three to one hundred and six within the next two years.
In 1902 William Rahr again severed connections with the institution and Henry Wernecke was elected his successor. Much credit is due Mr. Wernecke in conjunction with Mr. Goedjen, the superintendent. To these two, through skillful management and far-sightedness, is due, in a large measure, the prosperity of the last few years of the asylum.
It was a distinct loss to the county when Mr. Goedjen died, October 5, 1911. He was succeeded by Roland Kolb, former farm Manager. Mrs. Goedjen was retained as matron. It has been repeatedly said by all in a position to know, that, while other institutions may be ahead of Manitowoc county in the number and cost of its buildings, nowhere in the state are patients better cared for or given more homelike surroundings. This is due to the efforts of the matron, Mrs. Goedjen. The trustees are Louis Wiegand, William Kiel, and Henry Wernecke.
The original farm property of the asylum comprised fifty-seven acres. Now the acreage has been increased to two hundred and sixty-five acres. Owing to the fact that the land was purchased from time to time, some of it is about two miles from the institution. The original building was first intended to house abut seventy-five patients, for whose care and support the county is paid by those responsible , and with the revenue derived from the farm the running expenses of the asylum has been self-sustaining for a number of years.
Early in the eighties many Manitowoc county men, notably William Rahr, urged the building of the county asylum for the care of the insane and at a meeting of the county board in May 1884 $25,000 was voted for that purpose. A three story brick structure was built on spacious grounds southwest of Manitowoc and the institution was opened in January 1885 with Gustav Mueller as superintendent. The asylum has since been managed by trustees and has proved most successful, many patients from other counites as well as the local insane are being cared for.
A new building opened in 1950 as the Manitowoc County Mental Hospital. It was remodeled and expanded in 1978. The building was torn down after the new Manitowoc County Health Care Center was opened in June of 2003. Harbor Town Center regional shopping complex is now located on this site.",,"Manitowoc, WI",,

Built next door to the insane asylum was the Marathon County Home and Hospital which served as maternity and general hospital for poor residents. The asylum was once considered a model structure for care of mental patients. The county poor farm facility burned in 1909 and moved into the asylum complex. Fire destroyed the asylum building in 1926 which was rebuilt in 1928.
In 1939, there were 210 chronically insane persons in the asylum. The asylum operated until 1948 when it was renamed Marathon County Hospital. In 1963 it became Sunny Vale Infirmary, and a renovation of a tuberculosis sanatorium on Highway 29 became Sunny Vale Manor.

Koch building",County Farm for Inebriates and Idiots | Milwaukee County Retreat for Weak and Feeble Minded Persons | Milwaukee County Asylum for the Chronic Insane,"IMPORTANT NOTE: This was the second institution built for Milwaukee County at Wauwatosa. This institution was built to supplement the Milwaukee Insane Hospital, which was a semi-state institution and was separately administered.
Milwaukee's first mental hospital, known as the Milwaukee County Asylum for the Chronic Insane, opened in 1880 on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. The state reimbursed the county $1.50 a week for every patient in its care. At the peak of institutionalization in the 1940s and '50s, Milwaukee County housed some 6,000 people with mental illness in several locations. Accommodations were anything but lavish, usually two to a room, sleeping on cots and sharing a sink. There was no psychiatry or meaningful therapy, said Bill Baker, who worked there as an internist. People were basically drugged and warehoused.
There were three wards at what we then called the Milwaukee County Infirmary when I, B. Hanson, worked in the Activity Department in the late 1970's; two wards for men and one for women. There were 60 residents to a ward. Their beds were about 4 feet apart, with a nightstand for personal effects.
The activities department was run by OT professionals. There were dexterity and mental projects provided to the residents, as well as field trips, walks outside, arts and crafts and basic education for them to keep busy.  Teams of all the staff involved, from doctors to the janitor, met monthly to discuss each resident's situation in order to be aware of medical, social or behavioral issues. I remember a discussion with the doctors regarding too much anti-psychotic meds for a resident--I felt his tongue lolling might embarrass him on a bowling excursion in public. The meds were adjusted.
Residents were transferred to the old tuberculosis building, Muirdale, when the Infirmary was demolished. They then had the luxury of rooms with no more than three or fewer roommates, and sociability was enhanced. Muirdale also was more picturesque, with nice grounds for strolls. In the main, the residents were quiet, reserved, and often shy. Some had had electroshock treatments in the past. Many seemed to be there due to family issues far away in their past, and they had adapted to their constrained circumstances, such as they were.
The infirmary was torn down in the late 1970s and replaced with a parking lot. The Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex was built to replace it. Residents were transferred to the MCMHC when it was completed. The facilities were much more hospital-like and the OT Department was fully staffed, doing formal therapies as well as activities.
The former asylum stood on the grounds of what is now Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee and the asylum itself appears to have moved between several buildings on the grounds throughout the years.  Many of the original buildings on the grounds were torn down to make way for the building of a Childrens Hospital in 1980.  More information on the history of the asylum can also be found intertwined with the history of the Milwaukee County Home for Dependent Children that shared building space with the asylum for some time before the two separated. There has also been some confusion as pictures of the Milwaukee County School of Agriculture and Domestic Economy have been incorrectly tagged on the internet as being the old Milwaukee County asylum.  Much of this confusion comes form the fact that some of the land and buildings on which the county ag school was built were once owned and used as part of the county poor farm, which at one time may have housed some of the asylum patients.
This particular picture of the Milwaukee County Asylum is an etching and available on the standard Wikipedia page for the Milwaukee County asylum.  It is noted that the design and building of the facility was actually awarded to someone other than the person who designed this picture. The Wikipedia article states a Koch was picked over the designer of the picture, E. Townsend Mix. Mr. Mix is famous for building a lot of facilities in the Wisconsin area, mostly in Milwaukee and surrounding towns, but the Koch suggested appears to be Henry C. Koch who was a contemporary of Mr. Mix and also a famous architect in the area.  Henry Koch did some larger works in Milwaukee and in different parts of Iowa but is said to be most famous for his work on the Milwaukee city hall. I'll keep looking for a picture.  The picture is of an early Kirkbride style design, but the actual facility that was later built was probably more in keeping with the Cottage design, with several additions created over the years to separate the ""chronically insane"" from the acute patients needing more short term care.
The Marr and Richards listed at the bottom of this etching is probably from the engraving company that made the engraving of this picture; However, there is also a Richard Marr that was an architect that worked on buildings in Michigan, including the historic Architects building at 415 Brainard St., in Detroit. Based on the date of this picture (c. 1886) it has been suggested it is not his work, as he built the Architecture Building in Detroit in 1924, well after this etching was thought to have been made.
Included within the grounds of the institution was a cemetery for the purpose of burying deceased patients who were not claimed by their families or whose families could not afford a burial. State law required that the cemetery be located at least 200 rods from an institution treating the insane. This cemetery is separate from the Milwaukee County Poor Farm cemetery. Persons buried in 47-BMI-174 are not recorded in the Poor Farm burial ledger. A sign now pays respect to those buried in Potter's Field and shares some of the history. From 1852 to 1974 Milwaukee County buried the mentally insane, the poor and the unknown at little cost. They were laid to rest in four plots of land and forgotten. Some estimate there are 10,000 people in unmarked graves.

As was common with other ""County Homes"", OCHC originally consisted of the poor farm and a home for the so called chronically insane. In it's early years, individuals as young as 15 were brought to the facility and spent the balance of their days there. The asylum cemetery, closed in 1943 has 113 grave sites.
Over it's 112 year history, the facility underwent numerous changes. The final blow to the OCHC came in 2000 when construction of Brewster Village was started. This new state-of-the-art 204-bed facility stands near the site of the old building which was torn down in 2001.
There is still a cemetery, near Fox Valley Technical College west of Appleton in Grand Chute, the final resting place for 140 residents of the former Outagamie County Asylum for the Chronic Insane, which stood nearby. In a March 22, 1978 memo to the Outagamie County Historical Society, health center employee John Franklin reported that he had removed the only remaining tombstone a few months earlier. It was broken and leaning against a tree.
By the 1990s, the cemetery had become so unrecognizable as such there was talk of putting a service road through the property. Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer, whose father once farmed the land around the cemetery, heard about it and stopped construction before it began.
In 2014 a group of volunteers comprised of employees of Agape of Appleton began to gather information on a restoration of the cemetery. Soon after, other volunteers throughout the community came together and established a committee known as the Friends of the Outagamie County Cemetery. The project gathered financial and community resources which culminated in a dedication ceremony that took place in September of 2015. A granite memorial stone was erected with an engraving of all the names on record of those buried in the cemetery.

The price paid was $5,000.00 of which amount $1,000.00 was paid down and the balance was to be made in two equal payments, in one and two years. Mr. Robert N. McKay was appointed the first overseer, thus becoming the first administrator of the institution, as we know it today. He was hired at a salary of $500.00 per year.
By 1879, there were 19 inmates in the county poor house. Of these were five insane, five indigents, and nine orphans. The total cost of running the farm and poorhouse was $1879.60 and products were valued at $1557.27. The average cost per person came to about $0.88 per week. The big house at the Poor Farm served both as “Poor House” and “Insane Asylum.”
The asylum below Richland Center was built, however, the Bloom City property was still in use, as least for a Poor Farm. New buildings were erected in 1895 upon a tract of land, which had been purchased by the County about 2 ½ miles south of Richland center on sections 34 and 35 of the town of Richland. The County’s patients occupied the new buildings. In a book entitled “History of Richland Center” (1906), the building was described. “The main building is indeed a handsome structure, of red brick and cut stone, two and one-half stories above the basement, covering a ground area of 38 by 100 feet and is designed to answer the needs of the county for many years to come.” November that year, The county insane asylum was completed and accepted by the State Board of Controls. “The building as a whole is one of architectural beauty, substantial of construction, conveniently arranged and furnished and complete in every way pertaining to comfort and economy.”
Twenty-three inmates were in the alms department of the institution and 123 patients in the asylum in 1905. In 1929 the County Board in special session appropriated $25,000.00 for new building, to be erected south and west of the county asylum, which gave it an approach to it by the road through the asylum grounds. The following year West Home was built and ready for use, following the fire. With its completion the institution then had three separate operations: General Hospital, County Farm, and County Home for the Aged. The Hospital had a capacity for 154 patients and the county Home approximately 38. It was pronounced one of the finest, if not the best, in the state. There are 17 inmates who will be moved to the new home from the County Asylum where they have been housed since the fire.
In 1963 the State Board of Control declared the insane asylum no longer fit for patient occupancy. A decision was reached by the County Board of Supervisors to close the County Asylum, built in 1897. Patients who were from other counties along with many of those who were Richland County residents were transferred to other facilities through out the state. Those remaining were moved to the west building, which was built in 1929. [1]",1963,"Richland Center, WI",,

Through the efforts of the State Board of Charities and Reform, a statute was enacted that finally crystallized the county care system. The operation of the Rock County Asylum became official in 1881. Residents were referred to as inmates. The number of inmates continued to grow. It became evident that additional farmland was needed to keep the inmates profitably busy.
The county moved the Rock County Asylum and Poor Farm to 350 acres on highways 51 and 14 in 1894. Back then, able residents worked the land that provided their food. The Poor Farm and Asylum continued to be managed with the inmates doing the bulk of the work.  Very little was publicly said regarding the management of the Poor Farm and County Asylum by 1911. The facility was known as the County Farm, Poor House, Insane Asylum and County Hospital. Over the next 50 years, long-term care consisted of food, clothing, lodging and social supervision but did not include treatment by professional staff. “Deviants” of the community, were confined to the county farm.  These included epileptics, unwed mothers, drug abusers, and prostitutes.
In 1925 The Alpha Building opened as the “Women’s Residence”. Women living in the Alpha building worked in the kitchen and the laundry. Then in 1939 The Beta Building opened as the “Men’s Residence”. Men living in the Beta Building worked in the laundry and on the farm. The original asylum building was demolished sometime in the 1960s.
After fifteen years of planning and numerous set backs, Rock Haven was built and admitted its first resident in December 1964.  Rock Haven, a skilled nursing home, had a capacity of two hundred and forty-eight beds. All chronic patients in Rock County, however, were excluded from psychiatric services and continued to be “warehoused”. Also that year the Beta Building was converted to the active treatment (or “DATO unit”). In later years, it housed the Public Health Department.

The brick insane asylum structure (40 by 60 feet, two stories and a basement) was constructed in 1886, and the first admissions were five patients at the beginning of 1887. In 1918, the capacity of the asylum was 100, of which most were from Sauk County. Throughout the years, whether it be managing a smallpox epidemic (1904), running an intensive treatment unit for emotionally disturbed and alcoholic patients (1967), or developing an Alzheimer's unit (1996) dedicated employees have consistently given of their combined knowledge, skills, and efforts towards developing and growing a care centered environment for Sauk County citizens.

Prior to that time, the county poor had been housed in a facility in the city of Shawano and operated by the Frederick Eberlein family. The Eberleins had moved to Shawano from the Township of Herman in 1879. Mr. Eberlein engaged in the profession of saloonkeeper, while Mrs. Eberlein managed the county poorhouse, which was located on North Main opposite the Shawano County Courthouse.
August Hoeffs was selected by the Asylum committee in December of 1910, to be the superintendent of the new poor farm. In September 1911, the board met and awarded the contracts to construct the facilities. In February of 1913 August Hoeffs who had been superintendent of the poor farm was appointed superintendent of the Asylum also. Dr. W. H. Cantwell was engaged as the Asylum physician.
The old 200 bed asylum building was replaced with a 102 bed nursing home opened in June 1978. At this same time, the poor farm was placed under separate management. In March of 1997, the Shawano County Board voted to close down the farm operation, and all assets were auctioned off in 1997 and 1998.

Two years later on Feb. 19, 1878, the building burned. Four patients died in the fire. The asylum was rebuilt while inmates were kept at neighboring homes. In 1881, the county purchased 19 acres for the asylum and appropriated $20,000. It opened June 17, 1882. Forty inmates were placed at the institution, including those at Winooski and about 20 from Oshkosh. A 2--acre tract was added in 1886 and another 20 in 1889. By 1911 the asylum had 80 acres and 225 patients.
The Sheboygan County Comprehensive Health Care Center, constructed in 1940 on the north side of County V east of Waldo was a home for the mentally ill, mentally retarded, developmentally disabled and elderly. From a typical county home in the early days to the transformation into a nursing home, the facility saw many changes and implementation of programs.
From 1969 to 1978, the facility became an acute care service for the mentally ill and offered an alcohol and drug rehabilitation home. In 1975, the alcohol and drug unit was moved to Memorial Medical Center in Sheboygan. In 1978, county officials discontinued the mentally ill services and it became a county home for the developmentally disabled and chronically ill.
Then, in 1988, the state of Wisconsin became concerned about specialized individuals being in a nursing home setting. They then put into practice the state code 134. This code created the ICF/MR population program. The Intermediate Care Facility for Mentally Retarded residents became a part of the Comprehensive Health Care Center in 1988, and continued to be part of the services offered as the center was phased out and consolidated to two campuses, Sunny Ridge and Rocky Knoll.

Wisconsin,St. Croix County Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Croix_County_Asylum,,,1896,Demolished,Single Building,,St. Croix County Asylum for the Chronic Insane,"Mental health problems were solved when the “Asylum for the Chronic Insane,” as the St. Croix County Hospital was first called, was built in 1897 on county land north and a little west of New Richmond, WI. The first patients were admitted on April 27, 1897. The first board of trustees met in the office of Ward and Williams in New Richmond on January 18, 1897. Previously there had been some discussion in the county about where the county seat should be, and where the insane asylum should be located. The St. Croix County Insane Asylum was built in 1897 following an agreement between Hudson and New Richmond. It was agreed Hudson would “get “ the courthouse and New Richmond would “get” the asylum. A part of the St. Croix County complex to care for the mentally ill and the indigent, the “Poor House” was added in 1898. The building burned in 1924, and was replaced by a new one called the “County Home,” which eventually became an alcohol and treatment center.
The original hospital could accommodate 140 patients and the total cost of the building was said to be $54,000. A laundry, horse barn and main barn were built late in 1897. The first superintendent was Thomas Wheeller. The emphasis was on custodial care with the additional factor of safely removing some of society's problems from society's consciousness and conscience. In 1898 the problem of what to do about the indigent poor in the county was solved by building a “Poor House.”
By 1958, the Asylum’s timeline was beginning to shorten. The Poor Farm closed its doors, several buildings were torn down, and parcels of land were sold. According to the County Press Release titled, “Demolition of Former Health and Human Services Building” written in February of 2015, by 1971 “new state regulations prevented county hospital residents from working on the county farm.” It was later decided to auction off the prized dairy herd.
This building was eventually designated the “St Croix County Health Center”.

Much of the care was done contractually until the counties decided to take over and pay for the care of those in need through taxes levied by the county. Prior to 1880 Waukesha was one of the first counties in the state of Wisconsin to have an asylum and poor house run by the township.  As the burden of the cost of paying for the care for the poor and insane became excessive, the county taxation system stepped in and took over the running of the facility and all patients were moved from the prior facility to the new Insane asylum and poor farm.
The first paupers in the area recorded as being cared for by a separate individual were cared for by a Matthew Wright sometime prior to 1857.  In 1866 the Township took over the care of individuals with mental health issues and the poor with no means of support and contracted for their care with a Mr. McNaughton of Vernon, WI.  Eventually the care of the patients in his charge became too large a burden to be done in the existing facilities and it was decided that a new asylum and poor farm was needed.  Mr. McNaughton sold his farm and the buildings on it to the township and a brick and mortar asylum was built in 1874.
In 1902 it was decided by the state legislature that the care of the poor and insane should be taken over by the county and paid for through taxes levied by the county.  Plans for a new asylum and poor house designed by Van Ryne and De Gelleke, of Milwaukee, Wis were selected and May 12, 1902, bids were opened for construction of the building. The contract for the building was awarded to Dwinnell and Laughlin, while Michael Gleason  was hired to do the masonry work. Construction on the new facility was completed in 1904.  This new facility appears to have largely been used for those patients deemed insane, with the poor being sent to another facility that was separated from the asylum.  Use of the facility appears to have run until some time around 1951 when the last burial is noted to have occurred.
Built as two separate buildings, the insane asylum provided separate quarters (wings) for male and female patients and was located to the east, while the poor house was located a short distance to the west. Barns and other farm support buildings were also located on the property (a barn remains extant to the east of the facility). The county poor were transferred from the Town of Vernon facility and placed in the insane asylum until their separate poor house quarters were completed later that year. Sanborn maps indicate that the first addition was made to the west side of the poor house after 1929 (likely in the 1930s). By no later than 1949, the name of the facility had changed from the County Insane Asylum and Poor Farm to the Waukesha County Hospital Home & Infirmary.
It was in the circa-1950s that an additional wing was added to the westernmost end of the poor house. Dairy farm operations ceased in 1965 (although hog raising continued and soybean, oats and hay crops were cultivated) and it was at that time the mid-1960s block was constructed, which then connected the former insane asylum building (no longer extant) to the poor house. The facility, which would thereafter be known as Northview Hospital and Northview Home, would ultimately be used as a nursing home, which continued into the late-1980s. The easternmost and oldest wing of the facility was demolished in the early 2000s and the structure currently functions as the Waukesha County Huber Facility.

The final building was placed in Weyauwega, Wisconsin and approved the same year for use by the county building committee.
In the 1950's the Wisconsin county asylums all changed their names to hospitals.  This asylum than became known as the Waupaca County Hospital.

After reviewing several sites, the County Board approved a site in Marshfield. The city's newspaper announced with pride that Marshfield was indeed fortunate to be awarded the site. The site, located along County Highway A, adjacent to the current industrial park, was awarded ""due largely to the fact that it is located on two lines of railroad..."" The Marshfield News, November 25, 1909. It included 640 acres of prime farm land. Work began on the County Asylum on June 10, 1910 and was completed the following year.
Mr. and Mrs. L. E. Gilson were appointed the first Superintendent and Assistant. The building, which had a capacity of 250 mental patients, was staffed with 19 employees. Much of the care in the early days could be viewed as ""protective"" in nature. In addition, ""work therapy"" was utilized to a great extent as psychiatric medicines had yet to be developed. Many patients were expected to work at the facility performing daily farm chores. They were not paid. Over the years, this farm became one of the more respected operations in the county.
As the field of mental health progressed, psychiatrists, psychologists, and nurses became more prominent caregivers. As such, the name of the ""Wood County Asylum"" was changed to ""Wood County Hospital"" in 1938. The number of patients cared for at the facility remained relatively stable for the first fifty to sixty years. Many were transported via the railroads from other counties who did not have a county hospital.
In the late 1960's a significant change in the way county hospitals could operate occurred. Laws were enacted which forbade using patients of mental hospitals to perform free labor. Thus, the economics of the farm operations became less financially viable. ""Farmwork"" was no longer a recognized form of therapy. More energy was put into treating the mentally ill with medicine and talk therapy. This led to patients being discharged back to homes much quicker and the eventual demise of the county operated farm.
By 1972, the hospital's original capacity of 250 patients was only being utilized at about 50%. In addition, the main treatment building was quickly becoming outdated and in need of replacement. A decision was made to build a new facility which would allow more community integration of the patients.
In 1972 the current site at 1600 North Chestnut Avenue was chosen as the site for the new Norwood Health Center, Fears for the danger mental patients posed to community members were eventually allayed. On March 25, 1974, approximately 100 patients, and their belongings were moved into Norwood Health Center.
The year 1974 also brought about changes in licensing requirements for people being treated in facilities such as Norwood Health Center. Previously, Norwood was licensed as a County Mental Hospital. Patients came to Norwood with diagnoses of Mental Illness, Mental Retardation, and Alcohol and Drug Abuse. This was subsequently changed to segregate the disabilities into different licenses. Thus, Norwood Health Center became licensed as a Specialty Psychiatric Hospital and Nursing Home.
In 1988, the licensure of the facility would change again to include a special license for the treatment of adults with developmental disabilities. Currently, services are provided primarily to Wood County residents in need of short term emergency Mental Health care, as well as long term care for the Chronically Mentally Ill, and Developmentally Disabled, In addition, surrounding counties refer patients for the services provided at Norwood.

There were five clients and eight staff members.  The Faith Home was unable to renew its lease and moved to Milwaukee for three years.  In 1909, the facility moved back to Watertown and relocated to new quarters constructed on 40 acres of donated land. It offered jobs and training to the people they supported.  Some early jobs included basket weaving and rug making. When more land was added the facility began farming and raising their own food. In 1907 due to overcrowded conditions and a long waiting list, Bethesda built the first building on the 40 acres of land that was donated in 1903. Back in Watertown, Wis. individuals who received support and services helped with the farming, gardening, and tending of livestock while also helping to take care of those less able.
During the depression of the 1930s, Bethesda sold wool batts and thistle tea to raise money. Of the 368 people living at Bethesda, 245 received no financial support. Money was a problem, so the staff took a pay cut. Then God blessed Bethesda with two bequests and numerous other contributions, making the building of a new chapel possible.
By 1956, A notable milestone in the history of the Bethesda Lutheran Home took place when ground breaking ceremonies were held for two new buildings - a hospital or adult building and a school. The cost of the two units will be $2,000,000. The new facilities would enable the institution to handle 750 patients, the old facility had a capacity of 300. The first shovel of dirt for the new adult or hospital building was turned by Louis Pingel, who until his retirement has been superintendent of the institution for nearly 30 years, whose long range planning has included the present building program.
In 1980 three buildings at Bethesda Lutheran Home have been demolished to make room for a parking lot.  The oldest unit, the Eggers building, was erected in 1909 for a cost of $35,000.  The second section of the Eggers building was constructed in 1913.  In 1922 the Tetzlaff building, part of a $175,000 building project, was put up.  It was connected to the Eggers building by a long corridor which after remodeling to the front and rear became the Prange building.  In recent years it housed administrative offices which have been moved to the remodeled Pingel School building.  None of the demolished units met state fire codes and residents hadn't lived there for three to four years.  Besides tearing down the three buildings, the back wall of the chapel, which was the front wall of the Tetzlaff building, was also destroyed.
2004, Bethesda celebrated its 100 year anniversary. Expansion into community-based homes and services led to a decrease in the number of people living on the campus in Watertown, Wis. For those people continuing to live at the Watertown campus, a $25 million dollar campus remodeling provided private rooms and more individualized living spaces.
As of 2018 almost all buildings that were part of the main campus have been razed, the only remaining building is the Corporate Center. Bethesda also sold over 30 of it's group homes in Wisconsin to a seperate company.",,"Watertown, WI",,

Its first site was a farmhouse on a
15-acre site. Shortly thereafter, a three-story structure was constructed and other buildings added to comprise what is today 36 acres in a natural hilly and wooded setting with a combination of both historic and modern buildings.
Throughout its history, the hospital has operated as a private (non-governmental) institution and has been a pioneer in many innovative services in the field of mental health (hydro-therapy, in-service training programs for attendants, cottage residences).
Its founder, Dr. James McBride, built the hospital upon the firm belief that open air and open country were the best medicine for mental health. At that time, these were among the few options available for mentally ill patients. He put his theories into practice on a 38-acre tract along the Menomonee River. Dr. McBride’s vision was further expanded by Dr. Richard Dewey, who introduced a revolutionary idea. Dewey’s idea, called the Cottage System, was first put into place here. It soon changed the face of mental health care across the U.S. Before long, patients from around the country were arriving to take advantage of a distinctive style of care.
As years went by and needs changed, the campus responded. Once run on a for-profit basis, the facility became a non-profit organization in 1954 and changed its name to Milwaukee Psychiatric Hospital in 1964. The Kradwell School was established in 1963. It began as a full-service educational institution for patients. It then expanded its scope beyond the campus to meet the special programming needs of school systems throughout Southeastern Wisconsin .

Property immediately east of the City of Jefferson was purchased because of the existing convent and school for girls operated by Franciscan nuns at the church. By the early twentieth century, a large campus of residence halls, chapels, an infirmary, administration building, classrooms, and natatorium occupied the southeast corner of Highway 18 and County Road Y in the Town of Jefferson, which was recently annexed into the City of Jefferson.
During the 1930s the institution’s name was changed to St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children. St. Coletta became the largest, oldest, and most influential Catholic school in the United States specializing in the care and training of the mentally disadvantaged while encouraging views of various mental conditions to change at a national level.
Service has expanded over the years and moved from an institutional based housing program to greater community oriented services for people of varying functional levels.  Still currently an active facility, St. Coletta's has expanded from a single facility in Jefferson to serve people of many functional levels across the greater Wisconsin and Northern Illinois areas.  Offices are also held on the grounds of the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater with field placements offered through their Excel Peer Mentor Program.
In 2009 the Alverno building, run by St. Coletta's closed and the last of the patients there were transitioned to community based housing developments. The Alverno building is set to house St. Coletta's administrative offices and patients were moved to the Downer Home Clare County Estates.
Redevelopment of much of the original Jefferson campus is slated for the near future, with various designs centered on the reuse some historic buildings, creating of condos, and single family homes being negotiated by the current property holders.

When planning for the institution, a great amount of attention was given to the selection of the site, and the beauty of the setting and grounds. The medical approach to treating tuberculosis included extensive bed rest, exposure to fresh air and sunshine, and a diet consisting of plenty of meat, fresh fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. The emphasis on fresh air and sunshine meant that the buildings, site design, and surrounding landscape were considered vital factors in the recovery of patients.
Although the Sanatorium closed in 1966, the majority of the buildings and landscape have continued to be owned and used by Dane County. Adaptive use of the landscape as a county park and ecological restoration area has been successful. Continued use of the buildings by the Dane County Department of Health and Human Services has preserved them on site and provided pleasant office space.",1966,"Madison, WI",,

Wisconsin,Maple Crest Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Maple_Crest_Sanatorium,1911,,1913,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The Manitowoc County Board signed a resolution in 1911, marking the start of the Maple Crest Sanatorium, located north of Whitelaw.  County Board Supervisor Joseph Willott Jr. called attention to the high number of tuberculosis deaths at the time.  A total of 50 deaths were reported from TB in 1910. There were 250 recorded cases of TB in 1911. Leading the movement for the creation of a TB Sanatorium were prominent local physicians – Dr. Harvey D. Brown, Dr. J.W. Coon and Dr. J.R. Currens.  County Judge Chloupek also voiced his support of the project.
The County Board approved the construction of the Sanatorium at a cost not to exceed $12,000.  Equipment would cost an additional $1,000. Miscellaneous expenses totaled $2,000.  The Maple Crest Sanatorium was built in 1912 on an 11 acre wooden site.  The facility was a wooden-frame, two story site. The first patient was admitted on February 20, 1913.  By September 30 of that year, 27 patients had been seen.  It was recorded that 7 of these patients had died.
An additional wing was added to the facility in 1913. This allowed for 25 beds and another maid. The trustees reported that 47 patients had been treated in 1914. In 1920, the County Board approved additional rooms and porches to be constructed.  A separate brick building for nurses and janitors was erected in 1925.  A major purchase in 1934 included an x-ray machine, for a cost of $4,000. The Manitowoc Shipyards and Maple Crest partnered together in 1944 for a war-time TB control program.  More than 5,000 workers were x-rayed by a mobile unit at the yards.
In 1945 Maple Crest was honored on National Hospital Day.  A newspaper article from the honor states that Maple Crest was the first county sanatorium in the state of Wisconsin. 
In the 1960s the County Board of Trustees of Maple Crest approved a new plan that would limit the beds for tuberculosis care to 10 and provide 30 other beds for skilled care and nursing home facility. Inpatient tuberculosis treatments ended in 1975 because the facility was no longer certified under Medicare.  There were 4 TB patients that were relocated to a facility in Sheboygan. Continued operation of the site as a nursing facility was impractical with improvements to health and building codes in the 1970s.  The facility closed its doors in 1977.  The phase-out of Maple Crest was completed with the additional to the Manitowoc County Health Care Center.  At the facility’s close in 1977 there were 35 patients and 44 employees.
It was reported that in 1979 a group was interested in the property for a supper club and cocktail lounge.  The group was no longer interested in the investment a few months later.  Other options discussed for the site included a pre-release center with as many as 50 prisoners.",1977,"Whitelaw, WI",,

Muirdale Sanitorium, an isolation and treatment hospital for tuberculosis sufferers opened in 1915 on the County Institutions Grounds in Wauwatosa. The design of Muirdale, with a three story main hospital, was a departure from typical cottage-style sanitoria and soon served as a model for newer tuberculosis facilities. The hospital housed up to 700 patients in the main hospital and in individual cottages for ambulatory patients and children.
Over 10,000 tuberculosis sufferers were admitted to Muirdale between 1915 and 1936, a time when the only weapons against the disease were fresh air, bed rest and a controlled diet. When treatment with antibiotics and chemotherapy was introduced, the incidence of tuberculosis dropped dramatically resulting in the closure of Muirdale in 1970. The Administration Building later housed the Milwaukee County Nursing Home. Many of the smaller buildings on the grounds have been razed.
Muirdale ceased treating tuberculosis patients in 1970 and, although the main structure still remains, many of the outlying buildings and ""cottages"" were razed. It was renamed Rehab West in the 1970s and functioned as a care facility for elderly persons with mental illnesses but was permanently closed in 1978. The facility, which had been slated for destruction in June 1992, was saved due to the efforts of historical preservationists and is now being used as part of the Milwaukee County Research Park, a business incubator. It is now known as the ""Technology Innovation Center"" and is listed on a registry of haunted landmarks.",1978,"Wauwatosa, Wisconsin",,

Six mineral springs, each known for their medical and therapeutic properties, were an important part of Palmyra’s early years.  From 1870 to the early 1920’s, people from across the country visited Palmyra enjoying the healing waters at the Palmyra Spring Sanitarium.  In 1924, the sanitarium became the National Druggist Home, but a few years later interest in the therapeutic mineral water treatments declined and the sanitarium was closed.  In the late 1950’s the building was razed and the land leveled[1].

Wisconsin,Pureair Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pureair_Sanatorium,1918,,1920,Demolished,Single Building,,Tri-County Pureair Sanatorium,"In 1918, work began on the Tri-County Pureair Sanatorium after years of exhaustive lobbying by Ashland physician, Dr. Matthew S. Hosmer. Aware of the importance of the isolation of infected individuals as the key to reducing the spread of tuberculosis,
Hosmer had traveled throughout the Chequamegon Bay region since the late 1890s trying to convince area residents of the need for a TB sanatorium. However, no single county could afford to construct and maintain a sanatorium and since state law forbade
cooperation between counties on such matters, Hosmer faced something of a dilemma. This was finally overcome in 1915 with the passing of special legislation to allow for the establishment and maintenance of district sanatorium hospitals.2 Pureair was the first of only two sanatoriums to be built as a result of this change in state law.
The Pureair Sanatorium opened on July 12, 1920 with every bed filled although the building was only half-finished, such was the demand for a bedrest facility for TB in the area. Ashland, Bayfield, and Iron counties had a high incidence of the disease,
resulting from poor sanitation, health care and nutrition in the region. Consumption,as it was often called, was widespread among the Chippewas on the Bad River reservation in Ashland County and the Red Cliff reservation in Bayfield County. Tuberculosis was also the major killer of iron miners on the Penokee and Gogebic Ranges 'in Iron County, referred to locally as 
the ""black belt."" ""Loggers"" were also victims of the disease though it was not specific to any occupational type.
By 1921, the county boards agreed to expand the sanatorium to meet the treatment needs of World War I veterans who-had contracted the disease overseas. The 32-bed addition was completed in 1923. In the early years of the sanatorium's operation, the only known treatment for tuberculosis was to subject the patient to several years of isolation. Initial care consisted of near 
total bedrest. Fresh air was also considered crucial to the treatment and ""cure"" of the disease.
In 1945, state law was enacted to provide free care and treatment for TB. Prior to this, many families accumulated massive debts from the treatment of ailing family members. With the advent of the antibiotic streptomycin in the 1940s and later of the synthetic
drug isoniazid, the need for prolonged care at a bedrest sanatorium was greatly reduced. It was because of this and new surgical techniques that Pureair was forced to close its doors in 1975.",1975,"Salmo, WI",,

Lindel to design the $39,500 building. The cornerstone was laid in the summer of 1915, and the first patient arrived in a raging snowstorm on March 1, 1916.
The facility had wards and 24 private rooms, and was increased in size from time to time to keep up with the population growth. During the Great Depression, additions to Willowbrook were financed by a federal Public Works Administration grant. By 1937 there were about 10,000 active cases of TB in Wisconsin, but only 2,000 institutional beds.
It was reported that in Willowbrook’s first 24 years, the TB death rate in Kenosha decreased significantly — to the lowest death rate of any county with a population of 50,000 or more in the state — despite the industrial nature of our community. In 1938, the capacity at Willowbrook had grown to 71 beds with a staff of more than 20. Two more buildings had been erected: living quarters for nurses and a power house.
Soon afterward, the west wing was remodeled and a new purpose was introduced specifically for it: a county-run home for the elderly. It would be many years more before the name Brookside was official. By 1970, Willowbrook had a TB outpatient dispensary and later an outpatient clinic. By the end of the decade, Willowbrook was no more.",1970s,"Kenosha, WI",,
Wisconsin,Wisconsin State Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wisconsin_State_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,1905,,"Nov. 7, 1907",Closed,Cottage Plan,,Ethan Allen School for Boys,"In 1902 the Wisconsin Legislature responded to pressure from Progressives and public health reformers and authorized the creating of a commission to study the problem of tuberculosis in Wisconsin. In 1903, Governor Robert M. LaFollette instructed a three-person commission to investigate tuberculosis in the state, its treatment and prevention, and the practicality of a state sanatorium. Based on recommendations from the commission, the State Legislature passed a bill establishing a state Sanatorium in 1905 to treat state residents in the early stages of pulmonary tuberculosis.
The sanatorium, located on 200 acres of land purchased for $35 an acre from Welsh farmers near Wales, Wisconsin opened with 40 patients on November 9, 1907. When it opened, the grounds consisted of an administration building, a kitchen with dining hall (commonly called the “refectory”), two cottages, and a powerhouse.
In 1959 the Sanatorium was converted to the Ethan Allen School for Boys, which served as a correctional facility for boys age 10-25.  The state closed the correctional facility in 2011. Local and state officials in December 2015 discussed the possibility of reopening Ethan Allen, as a youth detention center or to house sex offenders, but those proposals ultimately fizzled. In 2016, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett also called for the school to reopen, but nothing came of that either.
