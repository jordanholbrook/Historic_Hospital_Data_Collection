Wyoming,Wyoming State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wyoming_State_Hospital,,1887,1888,Active,Cottage Plan,William Dubois/Leon C. Goodrich,Wyoming State Hospital for the Insane,"The State of Wyoming has demonstrated a historical interest in the mentally ill, as is demonstrated by a legislative proclamation on December 7, 1869, that stated, “provide for ...idiots, lunatics, and insane persons by transporting them to any eastern asylum"". In March of 1886, the Wyoming Territorial Legislature appropriated $30,000 for the erection of a State Mental Hospital. The ""Insane Asylum"" was completed in 1887. On March 1, 1897, the fourth Wyoming Legislature changed the Hospital name to the Wyoming State Hospital for the Insane. In 1923, the Seventeenth Legislature declared, “the official name of the asylum shall be the Wyoming State Hospital.”
The first building in 1887 housed male patients and their attendants on the first floor, women patients and their attendants on the second floor, and kitchens, pantries, and storerooms in the basement. The present campus encompasses over twenty-five buildings. The hospital suffered a serious setback in 1917 and historic preservation a real loss
when a fire destroyed ""all the buildings for male patients, including our central or administration building."" All that survived the fire was the 1916 addition to the
Building for Men, which was connected to the main building by a short hall and which lost only its roof. Superintendent Solier explains that ""thus building had a reinforced concrete slab for the attic floor, which effectually arrested the progress of the fire.""
By 1918, with a patient census at 231, Solier reported that the construction of a one-story fireproof cottage to house 45 of the ""more disturbed and unmanageable male
patients"" was nearly completed and would be occupied shortly. The Building for Special Male Patients was designed by William Dubois, and built with patient labor, using
material salvaged from the fire as much as possible. 28 Patient labor was also used during 1917 and 1918 to excavate the foundation and tunnel connecting the new cottage
for men with the main tunnel between the Building for Men and the Women's Building.
In 1922, the patient population had reached 322, an increase of nearly 30% in just four years. During that year, the basement of the Women's Building was converted to
additional wards for female patients, and the superintendent recommended the construction of more accommodations for male patients. In 1924, a two-story and basement addition was made to the Building for Men. Constructed as an extension of the east end of the north wing, the addition contained 28 rooms housing about 75 men. ""It is constructed of the same material and along the same architectural lines as the main building,"" Solier reported, ""so that it does not detract in any way from its appearance or interfere with its ward arrangements."" Between 1929 and 1930 an addition to the Building for Special Male Patients was constructed to house 25 male patients ""of a class that require special accommodations
in the way of housing arrangements so that we are enabled to sleep many of our more dangerous and homicidal ones in individual strong rooms.""
In April 1931, Dr. David Williams succeeded Solier as superintendent. Williams' took over the hospital superintendency at a critical period in the history of American mental hospitals. First, the Depression and later World War II drained public
funds away from these institutions, so that new construction came to a virtual halt during the 1930s and early 1940s. 45 At the Wyoming State Hospital, the only patient related structure erected during this period was the Building for the Criminal Insane, completed in 1935 as a Federal Public Works Project. It was also the last patient
building to be constructed during the period of significance. Second, radically different treatment methods began to emerge in the 1930s that promised to transform
mental hospitals from primarily custodial institutions, which the Wyoming State Hospital had clearly become, to places where permanent cures were affected. Among these treatments were insulin-coma induction, electroshock, lobotomy, and after World War II psychotropic drug therapy.
During the post-World War II era, two more trends in the treatment of the mentally ill affected the physical development of the Wyoming State Hospital. The first was the rapid development and use of psychotropic drugs to control the symptoms and regulate the behavior of the mentally ill, thus reducing the need for long-term care in an institution. The second, in the late 1950s, was the emergence of a national policy calling for community-based mental health care which relied on outpatient and day care facilities rather than more expensive mental hospitals to care for the nation's mentally ill. The result has been a steady decline in patient populations in mental hospitals all over the United States, including at the Wyoming State Hospital.
In addition to the five treatment units housed in nine treatment halls, there are facilities for staff as well as a chapel, Canteen Country Store, and a dining room and kitchen complex for residents and staff.

Throughout its existence, the WLRC has continued to change and evolve. The WLRC first opened in June of 1912 with three children enrolled. By the end of the year, enrollment had grown to 23. At its peak, the WLRC served more than 700 clients (1960’s), and today it serves approximately 90 clients.",,"Lander, WY",Colonial Revival,

In 1898 the grounds that are now the Sheridan VAMC were set aside by President William McKinley to be a military fort.  The fort was named after Brigadier General Ranald Slidell Mackenzie.  The first troops to the fort in 1901 were Buffalo Soldiers who used the fort for rest and retraining.
By World War I, the fort was closed and ready for demolition.  However, former President Taft, who after leaving office was appointed to the Supreme Court, was able to get the fort transferred to the Bureau of Health as a hospital for men coming home from WWI with battle fatigue or what is known today as PTSD.  The hospital opened in April 1922 as a 300 bed facility.  By the end of World War II, the facility had 900 beds.
Today the Sheridan VAMC has 208 beds and serves nearly 12,500 Veterans yearly.   The Medical Center boast eight Community Based Outpatient Clinics, located strategically across Wyoming.  Each clinic, along with the Medical Center, is staffed to provide a wide range of health and mental health services.[1]",,"Sheridan, WY",,
Wyoming,Wyoming Tuberculosis Sanitorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wyoming_Tuberculosis_Sanitorium,1923,1926,1927,Demolished,Single Building,,Basin Sanitarium,"In 1923 the State Legislature passed the act providing for the Wyoming Tuberculosis Sanitarium and providing for the location to be chosen by the vote of the people at the next General Election.
Then in 1924 when Big Horn County was selected by a large majority of the vote. Then a battle began. In late 1924 a tuberculosis expert from New York, Dr. Kidner, came to Wyoming at the request of the Wyoming Public Health Association to survey two sites near Basin, two near Greybull and one or two near Lovell and make his recommendation as to the best location. His first choice was the so-called Broadmoor site, south of Basin. Then in March 1925 the matter of selecting the site came up before the Board of Charities and Reform and suddenly Basin woke up to find that the meeting was being held and the only town with representatives there was Lovell. An appeal was sent for a postponement, which was effective and the whole town went to work to present their case.
On April 16, a committee consisting of Mr. Thos, M. Hyde, Mr. P.P. Anderson, and Mr. H.R. Armeling went to Cheyenne to present Basin’s proposal to the board. The recommendation of Dr. Kidner, the cooperation of the town and the input of several town businesses swayed the committee and the decision was made to accept the location at Basin. Construction began in 1926 and the official dedication was held May 17, 1927. Inscribed on the plaque in the lobby was the following, “Dedicated May 17, 1927, to the promotion of public health and happiness.”
Things started changing in the late 50s and early 60s, tuberculosis was on the downswing and more facilities were needed for nursing care of the elderly. By 1969 all references to tuberculosis were removed from any references to the Wyoming Sanitarium.
Then in 1978, due to a growing need for nursing care in the state system the Wyoming State Legislature appropriated the funds to study the needs and make recommendations. The final suggestion was that a new 120-bed facility be built in Basin. In 1981 the Legislature appropriated the funds for the construction of the new facility and the curtain closed on the first part of the story “Old San.”
The second part of the story opened with the state, the county, the Basin Chamber and other entities looking for ways to utilize the building. Suggestions that were made encompassed governmental offices, a crisis shelter, a counseling facility, a substance abuse treatment center and even a minimum-security prison. All of the suggestions came up against the same problem — money. The cost of renovating the building was prohibitive.
By March 1983 the decision was made to “mothball” the facility until a need and funds were found to utilize it. The mothballing was done with the understanding that if no use was found within a period of time the building would be torn down. So closes the second part of the story.
Fast forward 29 years later. For nearly 30 years the building has been left empty and unused, and even though many attempts were made to find a use for the building; no use for the building was found and the cost of renovating or razing it failed because of the cost of asbestos removal so the building continued to keep watch over the town of Basin. Eventually the years took their toll and the building began to deteriorate. The time eventually came that something had to be done.
The building was slated for destruction. After removing the asbestos and preparing the building to be razed in a safe manner the heavy equipment moved in and started tearing it down earlier this month.
So ends the tale of one of Basin’s landmark buildings. A building that was “Dedicated to the promotion of public health and happiness.” All is not lost however, because the arch over the door, and the emblem from above the front door will be preserved in a memorial garden on the former building site. The WRC will also utilize the old nurse’s desk.",1981,"Basin, WY",,
