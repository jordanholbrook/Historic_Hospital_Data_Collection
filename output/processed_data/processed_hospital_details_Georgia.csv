Georgia,Battey State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Battey_State_Hospital,,1943.0,1946,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Battey General Hospital | Northwest Georgia Regional Hospital,"Battey State Hospital was first established in 1943 as a temporary Army General Hospital to deal with the large number of wounded soldiers. It was named after Dr. Robert Battey, a physician who built a successful practice and was key in advancing medical treatment in Rome Georgia. However, in 1946, the state negotiated and took over the hospital from the federal government.
Georgia turned the facility into a 2000 bed tuberculosis sanitorium. During this period, the state was experiencing a surge of TB cases. Locally around the hospital, there had been 2,534 newly reported cases. The site was renamed to Battey State Hospital
By 1967, the state looked at the site for more health services. Then in 1971 construction had been started on a mental health unit. That same year, mentally disabled residents at Gracewood State School and Hospital were transferred to Battey.
In 1973 Bettey was renamed Northwest Georgia Regional Hospital at Rome. However, the state was looking to move more services onto the property. Afterward, in 1975, the first psychiatric and alcohol and drug abuse patients were admitted.
As the TB crisis abated, the tuberculosis grew smaller and in the 1990s the unit closed.  Each year afterward saw less people being admitted causing the remaining patients being moved into more local and private settings. Finally in 2011 the hospital closed.

Georgia,Central State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_State_Hospital,1834.0,1837.0,1843,Active,Rambling Plan,,"Milledgeville State Lunatic, Idiot, and Epileptic Asylum | Milledgeville State Hospital | Georgia State Sanitarium","Chartered in 1837, Central State Hospital was a product of the nineteenth century's social reform movement. Since its founding, the hospital not only has cared for thousands of patients but also has been the focus of political discussions in Georgia regarding the role of government and public health. By the 1960s Central State Hospital had become the largest mental health institution in the United States.
Movements to reform prisons, create public schools, and establish state-run hospitals for the mentally ill swept across the nation during the first decades of the nineteenth century. In 1837 Georgia politicians responded by passing a bill calling for the creation of a ""State Lunatic, Idiot, and Epileptic Asylum."" Located in Milledgeville, the state capital at that time, construction of the facility was completed in October 1842, and the hospital admitted its first patient later that year.
Care of patients was based on the ""institution as family"" model, which asserted that hospitals were best organized when they resembled extended families. This model met with great success at Milledgeville, particularly under the leadership of Dr. Thomas A. Green, who served at the hospital from 1845 to 1879. Green ate with staff and patients daily and abolished such physical restraints as chains and ropes. The hospital also became increasingly custodial as the population evolved from the acutely disturbed to the chronically ill and organically disabled, many of whom were veterans of the Civil War (1861-65) with little chance of achieving a successful return to their families.
In 1872 the hospital possessed a ratio of 112 patients per physician, a number that would not improve for almost a century. Central State underwent a dramatic increase in patient population during the second half of the century, when local communities began sending unwanted or problematic residents to the asylum, regardless of their diagnoses. The institution adjusted to this practice by developing increasingly more accurate methods of diagnosis and implementing differentiated ward placements under Superintendent Dr. Theophilus O. Powell, a noted scholar of psychiatry, who served from 1879 to 1907. In 1897 the hospital changed its name to the Georgia State Sanitarium.
The patient population grew steadily throughout the twentieth century. The increase in numbers meant a concurrent decrease in the quality of care. Part of the extensive hospital grounds had been reserved for the planting of crops, and administrators had patients undertake the strenuous work of farming these acres. The work entailed little treatment on the part of the staff but often proved beneficial to patients who would return to farm life when discharged. The overwhelming number of patients also led to a pattern of conscious neglect, whereby hospital staff met the basic daily needs of their charges but were unable to provide appropriate treatment for their illnesses. Such brute-force interventions as insulin shock and electro-convulsive therapy occurred in massive numbers until the coming of chemical intervention, which in lieu of staff increases helped reduce the patient load of nearly 12,000 during the early 1960s. By this time the institution contended with New York's Pilgrim State Hospital as the nation's largest mental hospital. In 1967 the facility was renamed to its current title of Central State Hospital.
The advent of psychotropic drugs reduced the length of stay and made home return more feasible for acute patients, but the ultimate goal of reducing the patient population clashed with the institution's political self-interest. Memoirs and newspaper accounts from the 1950s and 1960s accused several Georgia politicians, including ex-Speaker of the House Roy V. Harris and state senator Culver Kidd, of coercing hospital administrators into hiring political patrons to fill jobs that would be endangered by a reduction in the patient population. The intense political pressure felt by all superintendents during the twentieth century was reflected in the words of Superintendent Dr. Y. H. Yarbrough, who, upon departing the hospital in 1948, said: ""This is one of the happiest days of my life. In the hundred year history of this building, I am the only superintendent who hasn't been kicked out, or carried out feet first in a casket.""
Since the 1960s the hospital has encountered increasing pressure to shift from the medical to the mixed-therapy model, a move notably supported by Georgia governors Ernest Vandiver Jr. and Jimmy Carter. Today Central State Hospital is no longer the state's only mental health facility. The construction of regional facilities has reduced Central State's population while helping to improve its level of care and expanding the variety of its client services, which today range from adult and adolescent mental health care to the provision of secure facilities for the state's criminal-justice system.[1]

Dorsey to appoint a committee to investigate, report, and make recommendations to relieve the state of the uncared for “feebleminded.” One year later, an Act was established to open training schools for “mental defectives;” an old orphanage with 325 acres in a small community called Gracewood was then purchase by the state.
The superintendent’s report dated January 25, 1922 describes the formation of the Training School for Mental Deficiencies in 1919 with a $100,000 appropriation to erect a suitable institution and the purchase of the necessary land. One year later in 1920, te State of Georgia purchased the Tuttle-Newton Orphanage property for $75,000 with 325 acres of land. There were 8 existing buildings constructed of reinforced concrete and several frame structures. The buildings were described as 3 dormitories, a cottage for employees, an administration building, a school building, a dairy barn, and a cold storage building.
The City of Augusta appropriated $25,000 for the school to operate for the first year. The school was officially opened on July 5, 1921 and by the end of the year had 52 residents. In 1951, Dr. Norman Pursley became the 8th Superintendent of the school, and in 1952 the State of Georgia purchased additional land to begin an institutional farming operation. In the 1950s, the campus included a school building, an infirmary, a hospital, and 8 dormitories. In 1961, the name of the school was changed to Gracewood State School and Hospital. Improvements during the 1960s included an auditorium, gymnasium, Olympic-sized swimming pool, and a chapel. In the 1966 census, Gracewood State School and Hospital had 1,902 clients. The Gracewood State School and Hospital Archives was opened in 1996 in collaboration with the 75th Anniversary of the opening of the facility in 1921.

The discipline to be observed in said institution shall be reformatory, and the commission shall have power to use such means of reformation as is consistent with the improvement of the inmates as it may deem best and expedient; but a method of discipline shall be used as will, as far as possible, reform the characters of the inmates, preserve their health, promote regular improvement in their studies and employment, and secure in them fixed habits in religion, morality and industry; and the commission shall maintain such control over said inmates as will prevent them from committing crime, best secure their self-support, accomplish their reformation, and that will tend to make of them good and law-abiding citizens.
The reformatory opened in December 1906 and started out with a two story brick building containing offices for officials, sleeping quarters for more than a hundred boys, dining room, recitation room and chapel. It was  located on a site containing 200 acres of farm land belonging to the state, a short distance from the state prison farm. Preparations were made for caring for thirty inmates when opened. The first superintendent and matron was Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin T. Bethune, of Milledgeville.
In 1912 Joseph E. Lovvorn of Cedartown became the superintendent and Mrs. Lovvorn, his wife, matron. By 1913 nearly 200 boys were inmates here. There was a separate schools for white and blacks.  School sessions in the mornings, farm and other work in the afternoon. There were 7 grades with one teacher. Agricultural  training such as raising and storing forage and feed stuffs for farm mules and her of milk cows was done by all the boys as well as other farm work . An Industrial trade shop was started by Supernatant Lovvorn. Trades such as shoe repair, sign lettering, painting, barber work, tanning hides, blacksmithing,  and bottoming chairs were taught.
About 1912 an attorney named John Sibley organized a Sunday school here, aided by teachers, prominent business men and faculty members of both colleges in Milledgeville. Also the boys frequently attend church services in Milledgeville
Entertainment was provided by the manager of the moving picture theatre im Milledgeville and the boys saw one selected picture show each month.  Superintendent Lovvorn resigned in June 1917 and was succeeded by J.L. Smith, of Green County. When Smith resigned in 1919 Charles E. Bonner of Milledgeville was appointed to succeed him.
The name of the facility was changed to Georgia Training School for Boys in 1919 and placed under a board of managers ""consisting of the State School Commission of Georgia, the Secretary of the Board of Health of the State of Georgia (both of whom shall be ex-official members of said Board of Managers, and five other persons, citizens of said state, two of whom may be women, to be appointed by the Governor.""

Georgia,Allens Invalid Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Allens_Invalid_Home,,,1890,Demolished,Single Building,,Allen’s Invalid Home for the Treatment of Nervous Diseases,"1916 Description; This institution was opened by Dr. H.D. Allen in 1890, on the site of the old Oglethorpe University, which comprised 40 acres of land and a three-story brick building with 17 room and a large hall on the third floor. In 1891 a large house and 46 acres of land, about 150 yards distant from the original building, were purchased by Dr. Allen. This gave the institution two separate buildings, one for men and one for women, and this complete separation of the sexes has continued to the present time.
There have been built since 1891 an additional cottage for men and two buildings for women. Two hundred and fifty-three acres of land have been added to the original holdings, on which are grown a great variety of vegetables, etc., for the use of the institution.
At first only chronic incurable cases were received; the first two patients received in the early part of 1891, being still in the institution(1915). Afterwards acute cases were accepted, and this practice continues to the present time. Its is the endeavor of the Home to have a nurse with every acute casem and to give such cases every possible diversion that their physical condition warrants. There are no attempt made to employ patients other than what they themselves are inclined to do for their own occupation and amusement.
A training school under a charter was started in 1908, and three years later the first class graduated. Every year since then a similar class has graduated, and, with the exception of one nurse, all those graduated have continued in the service of the institution. The men nurses have never taken an interest in the training school. The men patients are attended by men nurses exclusively, and the women patients by women nurses. There are no women in the men's building. The average population in 50 patients, although as many as 65 have been in residence. Dr. H.D. Allen is superintendent and the assistant physician is Dr. W.A. Ellison.[1]
At its peak in 1920, a census showed 240 patients. Allen’s Sanitarium expanded to encompass 16 buildings, and it gradually acquired extensive tracts of the surrounding land, amassing a total of 120 acres. The property was neatly divided into North and South sections by a main road, effectively separating the Male and Female areas. In November of 1958, a group of physicians from central Georgia acquired Allen’s Invalid Home intending to repurpose it as a nursing home. They named the new establishment “Green Acres Health & Rehabilitation.” Over time, they began to divest portions of the former Sanitarium property, eventually constructing a modern nursing home behind the women’s building in 1962. By 1997, only the Administration building, which had also been Dr. Allen’s residence, remained on the site. Today, this historic property has been transformed and now houses two nursing homes, two trailer parks, a fire station, an apartment complex, and residences from the Midway community.",,"Milledgeville, GA",,,1890,,,,240,0

Brawner, Sr. purchased approximately 80 acres, including an existing 1897 farmhouse, from Mary Taylor.  Dr. Brawner immediately began construction of a 35-bed private hospital (later expanded by 10 beds) for the treatment of alcohol and drug addiction and mental disorders.  The sanitarium was listed in the National Register at the state level of significance for the contributions of Drs. James (Sr.) and Albert Brawner.  The hospital, which was at the time of its construction the only alternative to state facilities in Georgia, offered the newest in treatments for addiction and mental disorders.  The progressive hospital focused on treatment and cure, offered a high staff-to-patient ratio, and drew patients from all over the southeastern United States.  Dr. James N. Brawner, Sr. (1876-1959) served as medical director until 1955.  Dr. Albert F. Brawner (1893-1960), brother of the founder, was a prominent psychiatrist associated with the Brawner Sanitarium for 40 years.  Dr. James N. Brawner, Jr. (1904-1996), son of the founder, was medical director from 1955 until 1969.
The facility remained open as the Brawner Psychiatric Institute until the late 1990s. In 2001, the City of Smyrna acquired the campus. The property, having been reduced to 11 acres, had an uncertain future. In 2005 the Taylor Brawner House Foundation, a group of approximately 500 members lead by CEO and Historian Mike Terry, spent 4 and a half years raising half a million dollars to restore both the house and hospital. The building's restoration was completed in April 2009 and dedicated on April 18th, 2009 and is now used by the city of Smyrna for offices and special events while the surrounding property is a public park. Mike Terry later published a book in 2012 detailing the history of the property titled ""A Simpler Time: The Story of the Taylor-Brawner House and the Brawner Hospital."" The hospital was renamed to ""Brawner Hall"" and the farmhouse to the ""Taylor-Brawner House"" and has been used for a variety of events both private and public including the ongoing ""Food Truck Tuesdays"" and as a popular wedding venue.",1997,"Smyrna, GA",Greek Revival,,1909,1990,45,,,0

Georgia,Fulton County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fulton_County_Almshouse,,,1869/1911,Preserved,Single Building,Morgan and Dillon,Fulton County Poor House | Haven Home | Galloway School (Current),"The first almshouse in Atlanta (the county seat of Fulton County) was destroyed in the Civil War. The next location in the second half of the 19th century was in what was then a rural location at Peachtree and Piedmont roads. After that area started to develop into a residential district, the government of Fulton County purchased 1,000 acres even farther from downtown for two new almshouses to be built in 1911; the main building was for white residents, and another building nearby was for African-Americans. This occurred during the era of Jim Crow segregation when separate public facilities were commonplace in the South. The former almshouse for African Americans is now on a different parcel, owned by a different entity, and outside the boundary for this nomination. (It is currently used by the Chastain Arts Center.) In addition to using it as an almshouse, the county once housed black female prisoners in the rear section of the caretaker's house at the black almshouse. Some of these African-American women worked in the kitchen and did other domestic chores, such as cooking, cleaning, and caretaking, at the almshouse for white residents. These prisoners functioned as the staff for the white almshouse, under the
direction of the superintendent and nurses.
After 1932, the property also was known as Haven Home. Ms. Jessie Clark Boynton became superintendent in 1932 and remained in this position until the end of the almshouse era in 1963. She was instrumental in supervising female prisoners who lived in a wing at the almshouse for African Americans and did domestic work at the almshouse for Whites; she helped them find jobs upon their release. Ms. Boynton also instituted recreational programs for elderly residents.
The days of the building as an almshouse ended in 1963; the remaining residents were moved elsewhere. The property served as an annex for a local elementary school for a time. It was leased from the county in 1969 and became a private school, the Galloway School, founded by Elliot Galloway. Few alterations were needed to convert the almshouse to a school; some interior walls were removed to convert bedrooms to classrooms; the original windows remain. Dropped ceilings and new lighting fixtures have been added to the school as well as new electrical wiring. Some dormers have been added on the courtyard-facing side of the attic of the west wing to create more classrooms.",1963,"Atlanta, GA",Neoclassical Revival,,1911,1963,,,,0
