Texas,Austin State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Austin_State_Hospital,1856.0,1857.0,,Active,Kirkbride Plan,,Texas State Lunatic Asylum,"Austin State Hospital was the first state facility of its kind built west of the Mississippi. In 1856, the governor of Texas signed a bill providing for the establishment of the Texas State Lunatic Asylum. Construction started in 1857, and the first patients were admitted in 1861. The facility was renamed the Austin State Hospital (ASH) in 1925.
Today, this original building serves as the administration building for a modern, innovative facility providing psychiatric care to a 38-county region in Central Texas. ASH admitted over 4400 patients in the fiscal year 2006, with about the same number of discharges, and has an average daily patient census of 292. The focus of treatment is stabilization of acute psychiatric illness and return to the community.
The old Texas State Lunatic Asylum, which now houses the administrative staff of the Austin State Hospital, is the third oldest standing public building our state. With its completion in 1861 in the lush countryside north of Austin, the hospital stood as a beacon of hope and tolerance for the treatment of the mentally ill.
The asylum movement in the United States and Europe reflected the belief that people recently diagnosed with mental ailments could regain their sanity in an idealized environment free from the stress of everyday life. Asylums strived to provide a healthy diet, exercise, fresh air, adequate rest, a strict daily routine, social contact, and a kind but firm approach. This humanitarian philosophy marked a vast leap forward from earlier theories that mental illness stemmed from demonic possession and proscribed treatments such as flogging and cold water to drive out the demons. Texas modeled its asylum after an innovative program developed in Philadelphia by Dr. Thomas Kirkbride. The Philadelphia maverick had pioneered new, progressive treatments for the mentally insane, including behavior modification, drug therapy and an unrestrictive environment.
The lunatic asylum, later renamed the Austin State Hospital in 1925, strived to offer patients the most modern treatments, including art, music, and recreational therapy. It also provided state-of-the-art medical care, such as psychiatric drugs, hydrotherapy, electroconvulsive shock treatment, and on rare occasions, surgical lobotomy. From 1904-1928, the asylum also housed the Pasteur Institute, which provided rabies shots to afflicted Texans. Visitors to the administration building can view intriguing medical artifacts.
The original building, which was dressed up with a classical portico in 1904, offered three stories and a basement for administrative offices and staff and patient quarters. Its thick, hard plaster walls could endure frequent scrubbing and the thick limestone walls and high ceilings offered relief from the Texas heat. Noisy patients were separated from quiet ones, and all patients lived above ground in rooms with at least one window. As the patient population grew from the initial 12 patients to nearly 700 by the late 1890's, additional wings and buildings sprang up. The asylum functioned as a self-supporting village with artesian wells, gardens, a dairy, ice factory, and a sewing/tailor shop. These other historic structures were eventually destroyed by fire or demolished to make way for newer buildings.
Early residents of Hyde Park were drawn to the expansive landscaped asylum grounds, taking carriage rides on the 700 yards of graveled drives and enjoying picnics under the live oak trees and along the banks of lily ponds. Children of the era explored the Japanese-style gardens and paddled small boats to the tiny islands dotting the large lake on the southeastern corner of the property.
While a sense of timelessness pervaded the beautiful fenced grounds, the hospital nonetheless felt the impact of the passing years. So many attendants fell ill or fled with fear during the devastating 1918 influenza epidemic that patients had to run the wards. World War II brought personnel and food shortages. Racial integration began in 1958, ending the practice of separating black patients into inferior quarters. The new emphasis on personal freedom championed by the civil rights movement helped fuel the community care movement, eventually emptying the beds of the Austin State Hospital and other institutions.
The Austin State Hospital, which once housed more than 3,000 patients during the 1960's, currently serves as an acute care facility for its 300 patients. Patients typically stay several days to a few weeks until their condition stabilizes and they can return to their communities. The focus of treatment is stabilization of acute psychiatric illnesses and return to the community where outpatient support services can be provided by the community centers that work with ASH.[1]

The current cemetery opened in 1882, making it 25 years “newer” than the state hospital, which dates to 1857. During those 25 years, deceased patients were buried in a small on-campus graveyard. Their remains have since been moved to the new cemetery. The current cemetery has about 3,000 patients buried within, most unmarked. The cemetery still is used today, serving both the Austin State Hospital and Austin State School.",,,,"3,665 in 1960",1861,,,3000,3000,0
Texas,Big Spring State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Big_Spring_State_Hospital,1937.0,1938.0,1939.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,West Texas State Hospital for the Insane,"The 45th Texas Legislature authorized the construction of Big Spring State Hospital in 1937 to serve the people of the West Texas area. The city donated the 577 acres, which at the time was valued at $51,400 and philanthropist Dora Roberts guaranteed a permanent water supply. Governor James V Allred placed the facility in Big Spring because of the need for a psychiatric hospital in West Texas. Ground was broken in January 1938, and the hospital opened 18 months later in June 1939. Within six months, the hospital treated 402 patients, most of whom were transferred from other state facilities.
The original eight buildings designated as the general hospital were the administration building, including professional and administrative staff living quarters; the employees building, which included housing for direct care and clerical staff; the men's receiving hospital; the women's receiving hospital; the psychiatric hospital; the laundry; the power house; and the supply building. A railroad spur was located west of the supply building in order for the transportation and delivery of hospital supplies.
Five additional buildings were constructed on campus within the next 10 years at a cost of $778,000. Improvements to the grounds and the addition of equipment brought the total hospital investment to $1,060,571. Today, the hospital physical plant includes 25 buildings.
Big Spring State Hospital's staff also has grown since 1939. More than 100 employees originally tended to the needs of more than 400 patients. Two physicians, a social worker, psychologist, superintendent, clinical director, a storekeeper/accountant, four registered nurses, a dairyman, swinesman, yardman and about 500 attendants. Most of the employees lived on hospital property working 12-hour shifts. The pay was low, but was supplemented by free housing, meals and medical care. More than 640 employees currently work for Big Spring State Hospital, serving people in 58 counties through seven community mental health centers.
At the height of the hospital's population, more than 1,100 patients were cared for at the psychiatric hospital. During World War II, the hospital census fell to 211 patients, and buildings were closed for a short period of time. The development of active treatment programs, drug treatment, the addition of treatment modalities and the use of community-based outreach clinics, shortened hospitalization stays.
Patients attended dances, which were attended by employees, patients and Big Spring-area residents. These social events were held on the tennis courts during the summer. Movies were also shown for the patients' enjoyment, and the community provided a Christmas party each year. This tradition continues today, and is coordinated by the Community Relations Department.
The original methods of treatment for the patients were very innovative for their time and included hydrotherapy, ""fever"" therapy, insulin therapy, and custodial care. In 1947, electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT) came into popular use and it was added to the treatment procedures used. In the middle 50s, the census of the hospital was increasing and the hospital began to participate in the clinical investigations of the use of tranquilizing medications. When tranquilizing medication was finally accepted into general practice, many patients before seen as chronic and incurable, were released to their home communities and families and other methods of treatment such as hydrotherapy, insulin therapy, etc., were declared antiquated and taken out of use.
Big Spring State Hospital was the first Texas mental hospital to have its doors unlocked during the daylight hours. In cooperation with the local school district, it was first in the state to pilot an on-campus educational program; in 1990 it had a fully accredited school program on campus. It was the first to have a public-awareness program, specialty units for the treatment of adolescents and alcoholics, and both male and female patients in the same unit. The hospital was a pioneer in developing aftercare programs for the mentally ill. It was one of the first in the state to have an organized volunteer program. Big Spring State Hospital is financed through the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and accredited by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Health care Organizations and Medicare.[1]

Texas,El Paso Psychiatric Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=El_Paso_Psychiatric_Center,1991.0,1994.0,1996.0,Active,Single Building,,,"In November 1991, a State Constitutional Amendment authorized the sale of $8.7 million in general obligation bonds to construct the El Paso Psychiatric Center (EPPC.) The Center was to be owned by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and developed in conjunction with Thomason Hospital, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Life Management Center for Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services, El Paso State Center and the El Paso County Drug and Alcohol Abuse Services, known collectively as the El Paso Psychiatric Center Coordinating Council (EPPCCC).
In October 1992, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation approved submission of bonds for sale for the cost of planning and design. Remaining bond funding was used for the construction of the Center. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 2, 1994 and construction was completed in May 1996, with an opening in August. This legislative session secured $ 22.2 million for operating funds for the biennium. Additional funding was appropriated for furniture and equipment.
The Center is located on property leased from the El Paso County Hospital District adjacent to the west end of Thomason Hospital, the county's district hospital. Center construction was coordinated with long range planning on the medical campus, which includes the Center and Texas Tech University Regional Academic Health Center and Texas Tech Medical Center educational facilities.
The El Paso Psychiatric Center was a coordinated effort to deliver accessible, comprehensive acute care through the collaboration of the institutions and agencies composing EPPCCC and other community agencies. The Center's purpose is to deliver high quality, coordinated individualized psychiatric patient care, to teach and train health care professionals and engage in research. The Center is a new approach to collaborative community efforts in the state and a model for other developmental projects for mental health care delivery.
From January 2001 through August 31, 2002, El Paso Psychiatric Center was under the oversight of the Texas Department of Mental Health Mental Retardation (TDMHMR). On September 1, 2002, EPPC became the tenth state mental hospital comprising TDMHMR. Since September 1, 2004, the center is under the oversight of the Department of State Health Services (DSHS.)

Although located on the UTMB campus, it was administered independently of the school. Because of heavy damage from a 1943 hurricane, the state vacated the building. It sat unoccupied and unrepaired until 1945, when the state legislature gave it to UTMB. Reopened as a university psychiatric facility, the structure was extensively remodeled in 1959 and updated again in 1979. The building was renamed in memory of Dr. Marvin L. Graves, who served as UTMB professor of medicine from 1905 to 1926 and who introduced psychiatry into the university’s curriculum.

Texas,Kerrville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kerrville_State_Hospital,,1915.0,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Mountain Park Sanitarium | Thompson Sanitarium | Kerrville State Sanatorium for Negroes,"Kerrville State Hospital is on a hill overlooking the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, Texas. Around 1900 a dude ranch named My Ranch occupied this site. In 1915, 1,000 acres were sold to a group of San Antonio investors, who converted the ranch into the Mountain Park Sanatorium for patients with tuberculosis. In 1917 Dr. Sam E. Thompson purchased the property and operated his famed Thompson Sanatorium there until 1936, when it was acquired by the state of Texas for $80,000. The previous year the Forty-fourth Texas Legislature had appropriated $200,000 for the establishment of a tuberculosis hospital for black patients.
On June 1, 1937, the facility opened as the Kerrville State Sanatorium for Negroes; it was under the direction of Dr. H. V. Swayze. In 1949 the sanatorium was closed and all of its patients transferred to the East Texas State Tuberculosis Hospital in Tyler. The facility was reopened by the state in May 1951 as a branch of the San Antonio State Hospital, serving 119 geriatric women with mental illness. On September 1, 1952, it became a separate entity, known as Kerrville State Home.
By 1959 the hospital had grown to serve 1,200 resident patients; it had buildings located on 41 acres with an adjacent 258 acres that included a small lake. That same year the Texas legislature changed the name to Kerrville State Hospital. As the census at the hospital grew to more than 1,550 patients, the Fifty-eighth legislature appropriated funds to establish a Legion Annex as a branch of the Kerrville State Hospital. The annex, formerly operated as the Legion State Tuberculosis Hospital in buildings leased from the United States Veterans Administration Hospital at Legion, was remodeled to serve mentally ill patients.
It opened in 1964. In 1965 the Kerrville State Hospital census was 1,556, with 374 of these patients housed at the annex. By the early 1970s the hospital had begun changing its emphasis from providing custodial-type institutional care to instead providing individualized psychosocial treatment with an emphasis on the return of patients to the community. Kerrville State Hospital continues to provide facilities that meet standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and Medicare certification. In 1994 the patients moved from the thirteen individual residential buildings located across the campus to the new three-story, 200-bed Luther W. Ross Building; the new structure was named in honor of the Kerrville State Hospital superintendent from 1953 through 1992.
A major renovation and an addition were made to the psychiatric medical unit in 1991; this unit has a thirty-three-bed capacity. Patients could also reside in a psychosocial-rehabilitation living unit on campus. In 1994 the Kerrville State Hospital campus consisted of fifty-three buildings, thirty-nine of which were directly related to patient care. They included a central kitchen, a rehabilitation building (with a woodshop, an arts and crafts clinic, and an auditorium), a physical therapy building, and a psychosocial-classroom building. In 1994 Kerrville State Hospital was one of eight hospitals in the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation system. It served a sixteen-county area and had an approximate capacity of 350 beds to treat individuals aged eighteen and over. The Community Services Division of Kerrville State Hospital had eight clinics spread throughout its service area. These clinics provided early treatment intervention to prevent the need for hospitalization, as well as comprehensive follow-up for clients returning to the community after hospital treatment.",,,,"1,556 in 1965",1937,,350,,1556,0

Initially, there were six staff members who provided follow-up care to individuals released from San Antonio State Hospital.
In 1963, the center moved into the abandoned Harlingen airbase hospital building, and in 1965 the name was changed to Harlingen State Mental Health clinic.   By that time, the center had expanded to include day services for people up to 80 years old with a wide range of mental health and chemical addiction problems.
In-patient services with 20 mental health beds were included in 1968.  The center also began to offer alcoholism and drug abuse treatment services.  The following year, the center established outreach centers and clinics in key cities in the service area and the name was changed to Rio Grande State Center.
In 1972, the center added 130 beds for mental retardation residential services with the opening of two dorms on the campus of the South Texas Hospital.  Patients came from all over the state.  The residents participated in Adult Education and Independent Living Skills training on campus and Special Education in public schools.  Residents participated in the Special Olympics, Jaycees, Girls Scouts, and Boy Scouts of America.   Volunteer Services Council organized in 1964 donated a one-bedroom apartment building named after state representative Menton Murray, Sr., to RGSC so families from out-of-town could come visit and have a place to stay overnight.  The Menton Murray, Sr. Clubhouse is presently used by residents 55 years and over as the Retirement Program.  The Volunteer Services Council went on to later build a swimming pool, a nature park and a pavilion for all the residents.  Intellectual Disabilities Services presently offers 110 residential beds certified by Intermediate Care Facilities for Mental Retardation and Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  Many of the residents after intensive independent living skills training graduated into group homes in the community.
In Sept. 1989, a 15-bed Transitional Living Unit was opened.  The unit provided extended service for adults prior to their transferred to group home or back into the community.  This unit primarily served adults with chemical dependency and was closed in 1994.
RGSC was responsible for Community Based Services in the five northern counties of our service area.  Satellite outpatient clinics were located in Kingsville, Alice, San Diego and Falfurrias.  These clinics were separated from RGSC in 1996; however, RGSC continues to provide services to those counties.
July 1991 found the facility opening a new building to provide in-patient mental health services, adjacent to South Texas Hospital. This building named ""Wayne Potter Memorial Building"" in 2004 now accommodates two in-patient treatment units for persons with mental health illness for adults, psychologists, social services, nursing services, and admission offices.  Art work from discharged patients decorates the conference room.
In 1998, RGSC converted 20 adult mental health services beds in Edinburg to a 15-bed adolescent unit for individuals age 12-17.  This unit was closed in 2001 due to lack of funding.
RGSC is one of nine state mental health facilities within the then TDMHMR system.  RGSC serves an 8 county area for inpatient mental health services, and provides long term residential care and active treatment to persons with intellectual disabilities in a 12-county area.  Admissions to the RGSC comply with the provisions of the Texas Mental Health Code and/or Mental Retardation Act, and as such, may be on a voluntary or involuntary basis.   RGSC is in the heart of one of the most economically depressed and medically under-served areas in the United States.  The 8-county area served by RGSC has a population that is 83% Hispanic, 16% Anglo, and 1% other ethnic groups.  The catchment area is approximately 10,000 square miles.   RGSC currently employs approximately 366 employees.
Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation came to an end August 31, 2004 as a result of HB 2292.  As a result, the facility consolidated services with South Texas Hospital, which was then the Texas Department of Health, and the name changed to Rio Grande State Center/South Texas Health Care System.",,"Harlingen, TX",,,1962,,130,,,0
Texas,Rusk State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rusk_State_Hospital,,1878.0,1919.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Rusk Penitentiary | Rusk Hospital,"Rusk State Hospital for the mentally ill was opened in 1919 by the conversion of the Rusk Penitentiary building into a hospital for the care of the ""Negro insane."" During the first year of operation, some of the old penitentiary buildings were renovated, reconstructed, and converted into wards and hospital buildings, and 600 patients were admitted. Early in its history the institution included a general hospital for the care of the acutely sick, an infirmary for aged and decrepit cases, a tubercular hospital for the care of white men and women, and a tubercular hospital for black men and women. A chapel and recreational hall were later added. The institution operated its own garden, farms, hog ranch, and poultry farm, which supplied much of its needs.
Rusk Hospital had an enrollment of 2,426 patients in 1946. The average daily census of patients at Rusk State Hospital in 1964 was 1,942; by 1967, 1,886 patients were housed there, and a maximum-security unit for the criminally insane was a part of the facility. In 1970 Rusk State Hospital received accreditation by the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation and approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid benefits from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. More and better-trained professional workers were added, and a student practicum program was instituted with Stephen F. Austin State University and North Texas State University.
In 1970 the hospital served thirty counties in the East Texas Gulf Coast area through eight units. The average daily census for 1970 was 1,796. Since 1972-73, when the hospital had a population of 1,950 patients, different methods of treating the mentally ill, which emphasize outpatient programs and de-institutionalization, have resulted in reduced populations. In 1982-83 the hospital had 952 patients; in 1992, only 442.
A new three-story, 227,368 square-foot patient complex includes a 100-bed non-maximum-security unit and an expanded 100-bed maximum security unit was opened in 2023. The 200-bed unit will increase the number of maximum-security unit beds from 40 to 100. The hospital's overall capacity will stay the same.

Texas,San Antonio State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=San_Antonio_State_Hospital,1889.0,1890.0,1892.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Southwest State Hospital | Southwestern Insane Asylum,"In 1889 the Texas legislature passed a bill establishing a state mental institution to serve Southwest Texas. The new facility was to occupy at least 640 acres and be capable of housing 500 patients. It was to be known as the Southwestern Insane Asylum (not the Southwestern Lunatic Asylum, as it has sometimes been called). A site was selected five miles south of San Antonio and $200,000 was appropriated for the new hospital. The facility began operation on April 6, 1892 with a capacity of 200 patients.
In the first eight months of operation the patient population grew to 142. By August 23, 1894, there were 225 patients. Provisions for 300 more patients were authorized when $70,000 was appropriated in 1898, and in 1910, $100,000 was voted for expansion to accommodate an additional 300. This addition consisted of one wing each on the male and female departments and two buildings for tubercular. The improvements were completed in 1910 and the hospital could then accommodate 1,000 patients. In 1911 another appropriation of $45,000 was given to construct a building for 100 men, providing care to acute cases and all those who require extra attention. By 1912 the facilities could accommodate 1,140, and improvements were valued at $500,000. By 1915 the hospital's capacity was 1,800. In 1917 a training school for nurses in psychiatry was begun. This school, the only one of its kind in the state system, continued with a three-year course until 1942.
As of 1916 the hospitals buildings were all of the ordinary congregate type, except for the two psychopathic buildings, which each accommodate 100 patients. They were separate from them main building and included their own kitchen, dining room, etc. There were also two separate Tubercular pavilions which could accommodate 25 patients each and also had their own kitchens.
By 1925 the word ""hospital"" was substituted for ""asylum"" in state asylums, and such adjectives as ""insane"" and ""lunatic"" were dropped from their names; the Southwestern Insane Asylum then became the San Antonio State Hospital. In 1926 the average number of inmates stood at 2,103; the superintendent reported the hospital full and emphasized the need for additional facilities. A social service department was added in 1926, and occupational therapy was expanded. By 1932 the population had increased to 2,308, and crowded conditions were again reported in 1934. Five new buildings were completed by 1939; together with a nurses' home they enabled the hospital to provide complete modern treatment for patients.
By 1940 the population was 2,854, and the hospital was crowded to capacity. Patients had to be refused admission for lack of bed space, and a waiting list of over 700 occupied the jails of the state. The onset of World War II blocked a construction program, but the Board of Control was able to get all patients hospitalized by June 1943. The average daily population of the hospital in 1945 was 2,732; employees numbered 450. Only white patients were admitted.
Through the years the hospital grew at a steady pace, so that by 1960 the patient population was several thousand. By then the hospital was not only badly overcrowded but faced with the problems of low budgets, antiquated buildings, and an unacceptable staff-to-patient ratio. Some of the elderly patients were maintained in private nursing homes on a furlough basis. Daily census of hospital patients in 1967 averaged 2,700. Finally, as the result of a class-action suit originally filed against Terrell State Hospital, SASH came under federal court orders to reduce the patient population and increase the staff-to-patient ratio.
Racial desegregation at the hospital began in 1964 with the admission of the first black patient. The first black professional staff person was Helen Cloud Austin, who was unable to get a job at SASH in 1962 because of race but persisted in her efforts and became a case worker in 1964, opening the way for other black professionals.
In 1970 San Antonio State Hospital was accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. The hospital also qualified for Medicare and Medicaid benefits from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare by adding to the nursing staff. The average daily census was 1,836, and outreach clinics operated in Eagle Pass, Sinton, Beeville, and Bay City. SASH established a separate unit to treat drug addicts and expanded the alcohol treatment program. In the 1970s SASH was greatly improved by an extensive building program. The antiquated old main building and its adjoining wards were replaced by a modern administration building and a number of new ward buildings. Other improvements, which included new dining facilities and a media center, were funded partly by the state and partly by private individuals. Perhaps the most notable was the Transitional Living Unit, which was largely funded by the family of Mrs. Patric Sexton Dennis. Another was the All Faiths Chapel, which was financed by private funds and was strongly supported by Mrs. Enrico Liberto.
By 1990 the average number of patients had been reduced to 531 and the staff increased to 1,350. In 1992, 489 patients were served by 1,600 staff members. Centennial celebration events were held throughout April 1992. One of the highlights was the meeting of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology on April 6 to give board examinations to ninety-six psychiatrists, a significant honor for the institution. Dr. Steven B. Schnee, the superintendent in 1994, arrived in 1987. During his tenure the Texas legislature made a $2 million appropriation for SASH to establish a clinical research unit to seek new methods of diagnosis and treatment for chronically mentally ill persons. The program was a joint effort with the psychiatry and pharmacology departments of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and the School of Pharmacy of the University of Texas at Austin. In the 1990s San Antonio State Hospital also operated acute care, extended care, multiple disability, psychiatric intensive care, adolescent, bi-cultural, geriatric care, and chemical dependency units.[1]

Texas,Terrell State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Terrell_State_Hospital,,1883.0,1885.0,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Mostly Demolished),,North Texas Lunatic Asylum | North Texas Hospital for the Insane,"In 1883, when word was circulated that the State of Texas was seeking a location for a second major mental facility and that it would be located in Northeast Texas, the competition among cities must have been quite similar to the quest for industry and other major developments that exist today.
Terrell was fortunate at that time to include among the citizens of a still young town a large group of people with the foresight to understand what such a facility could mean to a growing city. But even the farsightedness of legendary rancher and banker Col. Jim Harris, who gave the necessary acreage to the state for a meager return, could not have visualized the proportions to which Terrell State Hospital has grown today nor the immense impact it has had on the local economy for over 100 years.
A total of $200,000 was appropriated for the purchase of the property and construction of the original facilities. It all began, officially, on February 16, 1883, when the 18th Texas Legislature enacted a statute introduced by Judge John Austin. The word ""asylum""--by the original definition--was a place of refuge and safety and that, at best, was the primary service offered by mental facilities in the United States at that time.
Governor John Ireland commissioned the purchase of 672.65 acres of land located east of Terrell and offered by Jim Harris. This would be site for the branch asylum and the new institution was to be known as North Texas Lunatic Asylum. Its stated purpose was to provide treatment and care for the ""chronic incurable insane"" of the state's northern counties.
John McDonald was contracted as the builder of the new facility and J. N. Preston & Sons of Austin were the architects. Construction was completed and the new hospital was opened on July 14, 1885, with the admission of the first patient. Resident officers were Dr. D. R. Wallace, Superintendent, Dr. F. W. White, Assistant Physician; H. W. Flowers, Steward and Bookkeeper; Clark Griffith, Apothecary; and S. L. Wallace, Matron.
Dr. White, who admitted the first patient, later served as Superintendent of both the San Antonio and Wichita Falls State Hospitals. Originally a Board of Directors governed the hospital. The first board included J. S. Grinnan, J. H. Muckleroy, S. A. Shortridge, John S. Griffith and R. M. McClung. During the first year 330 patients were admitted from 46 counties. The next year the number increased to 387 and continued to increase correspondingly through the years.
By 1920, the institution had undergone a virtual rebuilding and had grown to a population of 2,300 making it the largest hospital of its kind west of the Mississippi River. None of the original buildings still stand, but the fountain in the circular park--recently repaired and restored to use--remains from the original construction. The plan of the grounds, though much expanded, is similar to the original layout; and the park-like beauty of the grounds has been preserved and enhanced. Constructed in 1927, the present administration building is similar in its multi-storied design to the building it replaced, an indication that hospital architecture changed little during that span of years.
Since 1885, the institution has had three names that reflect changes both in attitudes toward mental illness and approaches in treatment. The name North Texas Hospital for the Insane was adopted in 1888 and used until 1925 when Dr. George Powell, Superintendent, requested that the name be changed to Terrell State Hospital.
The hospital continued to be governed by a local board of managers until 1920 when the State Board of Control assumed the duties for governing State Eleemosynary Institutions. Starting in 1949, the operation of Terrell State Hospital came under the control and management of the Board of Texas State Hospitals and Special Schools. The 59th Legislature in 1965, under House Bill No. 3, created the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act for control and management of Terrell State Hospital and other state hospitals. The Board of Texas State Hospital and Special Schools was abolished at that time.
There have been major improvements planned and completed at Terrell State Hospital in recent years at a cost of many millions of dollars. The changes, over a period of years, have transformed this pioneer hospital into a modern psychiatric facility that serves 21 counties in the north and northeastern part of the state.

Texas,Texas Confederate Home for Men,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Texas_Confederate_Home_for_Men,1884.0,,1886.0,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"The Texas Confederate Home began as a project of the John B. Hood Camp of United Confederate Veterans, which obtained a charter from the state on November 28, 1884. The camp's main purpose was to establish a home for disabled and indigent Confederate veterans. The Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy cooperated in raising funds for the home. In 1886 the camp purchased sixteen acres of land at 1600 West Sixth Street in Austin from John B. and Mary Armstrong, and the home opened on November 1, 1886. In December of that year the UDC held a ""Grand Gift Concert and Lottery,"" with prizes donated by the public, and raised over $10,800 to support the home.
Operating funds continued to come from public contributions until 1891, when the state assumed control and support, and the name officially became Texas Confederate Home. The John B. Hood Camp deeded the property to the state on March 6, 1891. Management was the responsibility of a board of managers made up of five Confederate veterans appointed by the governor and a superintendent, also a Confederate veteran, who was selected by the board. The complex on twenty-six acres of land on West Sixth Street had several buildings, including the large administration building and living quarters, a brick hospital, and private cottages. On January 1, 1920, the legislature established the Board of Control, abolished the board of managers for the Confederate Home, and transferred the responsibility of appointing a superintendent to the new agency. In 1949 the Fifty-first Legislature transferred control and management of the Confederate Home to the Board for Texas State Hospitals and Special Schools.
However, the Board of Control continued to handle purchases for the institution. The Board for Texas State Hospitals and Special Schools administered the home until it was closed. During its first two years of operation under the Hood Camp, 113 veterans were admitted to the home, and from 1887 to 1953 more than 2,000 former Confederates were housed in the facility. In 1929 there were 312 residents, but by 1936 the number had dropped to eighty. As more of the veterans died, the number of residents continued to decrease; there were thirty-eight in 1938. By that time the average age of the men was ninety-three. In 1943 only six Confederates were still in residence. Thomas Riddle, the last veteran, died in 1954 at the age of 108.
By act of the Forty-eighth Legislature, ""senile"" mental patients from other state institutions were transferred to the Confederate Home. After 1939 disabled veterans of the Spanish American War and World War I, as well as their spouses, were admitted. For a number of years, the facility served the mentally ill while retaining the Texas Confederate Home for Men name. By 1947, 527 men resided at the home, almost one hundred men more than the highest number of veterans who ever inhabited the home at one time. The legislature specified that the men who were moved to the facility must be non-violent with no criminal records. Various inspections by state agencies found the hospital to be in “immaculate” condition with the residents well cared for and apparently content. Despite the facility‟s use to house senile patients, the public called for its closure in 1949 since it no longer housed any Confederate veterans. In fact, only a handful of veterans remained on the pension roll throughout the state. Legislation required that the home maintain twenty beds to house Confederate veterans, though none had been occupied since 1945. Those who sought the facility's closure argued that it had outlived its usefulness. [1]
In 1963 the remaining patients were sent to Kerrville State Hospital, and the Austin facility was transferred to the Austin State Hospital as an annex. In 1970 the property was purchased by the University of Texas in Austin. Construction crews razed the remaining buildings on the property that December, eliminating all physical
signs that the home had ever existed. The university built housing for married students on the site at 1600 West Sixth Street. A local construction supply company obtained the bricks from the property and sold them to a number of clients.
Throughout its existence, more than 2,000 indigent or disabled veterans stayed in the home. Many of those veterans are buried here at the Texas State Cemetery. They have more than 2,200 Confederates and their spouses buried in the southeast corner of the Cemetery. Confederate Field, with its nearly uniform appearance of small rectangular headstones, is probably the most iconic image of the State Cemetery.",1963,"Austin, TX",,,1886,1963,20,2000,527,0
Texas,Vernon State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Vernon_State_Hospital,,,1951.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Vernon State Center | North Texas State Hospital,"The first state psychiatric facility in Vernon, TX, was a geriatric extension of Wichita Falls State Hospital called the Annex. It was first opened in 1951 at Victory Field, the former World War II Army Air Corp pilot training facility south of the city. It served about 400 ""senile-type"" patients. In 1967, construction of a new psychiatric rehabilitative facility began on 69 acres at the northwest edge of Vernon. In 1969, Vernon State Center began operation as a state hospital serving general psychiatric patients from 30 counties of northern Texas, independent of Wichita Falls State Hospital. It offered inpatient psychiatric services to a predominantly rural population and also operated seven rural-based outreach centers. Dr. Frankie Williams was the first Superintendent and served in that capacity until March 1986. (She was the first female superintendent in the Texas MHMR system and won a number of awards recognizing her as a pioneer in the mental health care field.)
In 1971, the Texas Legislature created a statewide treatment facility for drug dependent youth. Because of Vernon's remote location from the metropolitan drug scene, it was selected to be the site for this new service. The old Victory Field facility was again called into service. After extensive renovations and new building projects, Vernon State Center's South Campus received its first patients in March 1974. Over the years, the adolescent population evolved: From the first years as a drug treatment facility, the need became one to serve teens with a dual diagnosis of drug dependency and a mental illness. The program - serving an average census of 75 patients — was eventually renamed the Adolescent Forensic Program (AFP) because approximately 90% of the patients had, in addition to a dual diagnosis, an involvement with the law enforcement/judicial system.
In 1983, Vernon State Center's name was changed to Vernon State Hospital (VSH) to maintain continuity throughout the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (TDMHMR) system.
In 1987, the 70th Texas Legislature moved the state's forensic psychiatric program from Rusk State Hospital to Vernon State Hospital. The VSH general psychiatric patients were transferred to Wichita Falls State Hospital, and the VSH North Campus was subsequently converted to a maximum security facility. The forensic patients were transferred from Rusk to VSH between April and July of 1988. The Vernon State Hospital Maximum Security Unit - with an average census of 280 patients - was mandated to provide services to the following six populations:
-Persons with felony charges who have been found incompetent to stand trial;
-Persons admitted for pre-trial evaluations for competency and issues of insanity;
-Persons found not guilty by reason of insanity
-Persons from other state hospitals who have been found to be manifestly dangerous
-Mentally retarded persons who have been found incompetent to stand trial on misdemeanor or felony charges
-Persons from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) and other jails who need inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. The hospital has never been asked to fulfill this mandate as TDCJ developed its own psychiatric services.
In February 1995, Vernon State Hospital celebrated becoming the first hospital in the TDMHMR system to meet requirements to be released from terms of the 20-year-old RAJ class action lawsuit. This lawsuit (styled RAJ after the initials of the patient on whose behalf it was filed in 1974) addressed a patient's right to appropriate and individualized treatment.
The year 1995 also marked the birth of an initiative between TDMHMR, the Texas Youth Commission (TYC), Vernon State Hospital, the City of Vernon, and the Vernon Business Development Corporation to open a TYC youth boot camp facility at VSH's South Campus. As a result of the cooperative efforts of all parties, the VSH South Campus (Victory Field facility) was leased to the Texas Youth Commission the following year. The VSH Adolescent Forensic Program transferred to the VSH North Campus in September 1996, moving into four renovated buildings on the south side of the Maximum Security Program. The move necessitated an $8.5 million construction project, resulting in the building of the Mooney Building, which houses the adult Behavior Management and Treatment Program, and the Heatly Building, a new adolescent activity building. It also necessitated additions to the administrative complex, new fencing, and other renovations. By the late fall of 1997, the adult maximum security and adolescent forensic programs were fully operational at one campus location.
In January 1996, TDMHMR combined the administrations of Vernon State Hospital and Wichita Falls State Hospital under the leadership of James E. Smith, Superintendent. This initiative was in answer to the ever-pressing need to provide the citizens of Texas with more effective and more cost-efficient mental health care. Consolidation of the two hospitals became official on September 1, 1998, under the temporary name Vernon-Wichita? Falls State Hospital. Nine months later, the 76th Legislature formally renamed the organization North Texas State Hospital, retaining the location names - Vernon campus and Wichita Falls campus - to designate the individual sites.
The Vernon campus of North Texas State Hospital has a history of offering exceptional mental health care to the various groups of patients entrusted to its care and plans to continue to offer the best care available to the specialized populations of patients who are now in its charge. Throughout the years, it has maintained Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations accreditation as well as a reputation for ""country care."" It has become nationally recognized as a benchmark in the forensic mental health care field.
After two and a half years of intensive planning and incremental consolidation, Vernon and Wichita Falls State Hospitals officially became a single mental health care organization on September 1, 1998. In April 1999, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations conducted an extension survey of the campuses and granted accreditation to Vernon-Wichita Falls State Hospital as a consolidated facility. The following month, the state legislature formally renamed the ""new"" organization North Texas State Hospital (NTSH).
Today North Texas State Hospital operates two sites 55 miles apart in north Texas. The Vernon campus provides forensic services for the entire state of Texas and offers both a 284-bed Maximum Security Program for adults and a 78-bed Adolescent Forensic Program for dually diagnosed youth ages 13-17. The Wichita Falls campus provides general psychiatric inpatient services for child, adolescent, adult, and geriatric patients with a bed capacity of 330.

Texas,Wichita Falls State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wichita_Falls_State_Hospital,1917.0,,1922.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Northwest Texas Insane Asylum | North Texas State Hospital,"In 1917, the State of Texas created the Northwest Texas Insane Asylum. It was located on 940 acres seven miles south of Wichita Falls. The first patient was admitted to this new facility in 1922. In 1925, the name was changed to Wichita Falls State Hospital (WFSH). It had a modern surgical operating room, radiology, laboratory, electrotherapy apparatus, and hydrotherapy equipment. By 1930, the census was over 1500 patients with a staff of 235, including seven doctors and 93 attendants. During the height of the Depression, the hospital was virtually a self-sustaining community. It had an agricultural enterprise that included farming, hogs, chickens, and cattle. Most of the staff lived on the campus.
By World War II, the hospital consisted of 35 brick buildings and 60 frame structures. Due to wartime shortage of available employees, 234 staff members served approximately 2400 patients. Staff worked six days per week, 12 hours per day. Six nurses rotated coverage at night; three staff members offered occupational therapy. The end of the war saw the total number of employees rise to 503 by the early 1950's. In 1951, Vernon State Home was activated as a branch of WFSH at the old Victory Field Army Air Corps training field. Vernon served about 400 patients ""who do not require an active medical or psychiatric program,"" while WFSH continued with a census of 2400. Volunteer programs and charitable donations made life more pleasant for the patients during this period.
In 1955, psychiatric treatment was revolutionized with the introduction of psychotropic medications. Major changes in mental health care continued to occur in the 1960's. The Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation was created. New community MHMR centers and outreach programs were established through the state hospital system to better serve the citizens of Texas. The first volunteer services coordinator was hired in 1960, and the first social worker was hired in 1966. Vernon State Hospital (VSH) was established as a state hospital separate from WFSH in 1969. Child and adolescent services were added in the early 1970's. With more effective medications, increased community services, and placement in nursing homes, the hospital census dropped below 900 by the middle of the decade. This period was the first time WFSH sought accreditation from outside agencies such as Medicare and the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals. These accreditations required major renovations to meet Life Safety Codes and minimum quality of care standards. They also required richer staffing ratios. Tremendous amounts of money allocated into the TDMHMR system as a result of the RAJ lawsuit in 1974 allowed the hospital to increase the number of professional staff, the types of service provided, and the overall quality of care given to patients.
The 1980's saw the genesis of psychosocial programming and programs such as the client worker program, Fairweather Lodge, and Career Village. These programs profoundly affected the ability of patients to return to their communities. Vernon State Hospital was redefined as the state's forensic psychiatric facility in 1987; as a result, WFSH's catchment area grew from 23 counties to 53. By late in the decade, the average census at WFSH had fallen below 500, while the number of admissions and discharges increased. The hospital was more effectively and efficiently treating more people. The end of the decade also saw the introduction of the first atypical antipsychotic drug, Clozaril. Although extremely expensive and wrought with many side effects, it could effect profound improvement in some persons with mental illness.
Another change in Wichita Falls State Hospital's operation came in 1993 when the responsibility for the substance abuse recovery program was removed from the state hospitals and given to the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse. A major innovation in clinical quality improvement came with the inception of the Quality System Oversight Program (QSO) in the early 1990's. This system, designed by TDMHMR and approved by the courts, allowed state hospitals to monitor themselves and benchmark the level of service they delivered to their patients. Concern for healthcare costs and methods lead TDMHMR to explore new and more efficient ways of doing business. As a result of that initiative, TDMHMR initiated the merger of the administrations of Wichita Falls State Hospital and Vernon State Hospital in January 1996. Through the efforts of the caring and competent staff of both hospitals, WFSH exited the RAJ lawsuit in October 1997. This marked the first time in 23 years that TDMHMR was free to guide its own performance and set its own improvement goals.
After two and a half years of intensive planning and incremental consolidation, Vernon and Wichita Falls State Hospitals officially became a single mental health care organization on September 1, 1998. In April 1999, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations conducted an extension survey of the campuses and granted accreditation to Vernon-Wichita?

Texas,Abilene State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Abilene_State_School,1899.0,1900.0,1904.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,State Epileptic Colony | Abilene State Hospital  | Abilene State Supported Living Center (Current),"1897...Governor Joseph D. Sayer appointed a commission to select a location for an epileptic colony. The plan was to build something large enough to house 500 people, which made it the largest colony in the world.
Abilene residents were hoping that such a colony would boost the economy, but some thought that because of poor water supply, Abilene wouldn't be considered.
1899...The Texas State Legislature approved the decision. Abilene was chosen as the site for the “State Epileptic Colony”. The last institution for the mentally ill established in Texas before the turn of the century represented a conceptual advance in that it separated individuals with seizures from patients with mental illness.
Citizens donated $3200 to purchase 640 acres, three miles southeast of Abilene and the land was given to the state for the colony. The site was chosen due to close access to the railroad, which made it easy to receive building materials and patients. The acreage was used to raise animals and crops for food and for homes and administrative offices. The colony cost $200,000 to build. The original institution was an administration building, power plant, women's hospital, men's hospital, four resident cottages and the superintendent's residence. Two weeks before the school opened, the water tower fell and left the colony without water. A temporary tower was erected, but supplied only enough water for 1/3 of the patients. It was not replaced with a standpipe until six years later.
1904...Opened as the State Epileptic Colony in March 26th, 1904
The only institution of its kind in the United States, the State Epileptic Colony opened its doors March 26th, 1904. It immediately filled to capacity with transfers from the three state asylums. Dr. John Preston, the colony's first superintendent, admitted 104 patients that day. Treatment was a combination of proper diet, hygiene, regular habits, and exercise. The state provided free treatment for indigent patients. Others paid five dollars a week for board, medication and treatment. By August, the institution was filled to capacity with 201 patients.
1925...The state of Texas saw the need to include care for those who suffered from mental illness. To reflect the nature of its care the name of the colony was changed to the Abilene State Hospital. The hospital continued to serve as an asylum for epileptics. It was the only such institution in the south and southwest.
1943...The campus grew from six buildings in 1904 to sixty-three in 1943 including; officer's quarters, physician's cottages, two hospitals, twenty eight wards (homes) and barns. The number of patients grew from 300 in 1909 to 1,324 in 1943. As the population grew, providing patient care became difficult. Trained personnel were almost impossible to find. There were not enough attendants to care for the patients because of a lack of funds to pay decent wages. Pleas were repeatedly sent to the legislature for appropriations for salary raises, equipment and new buildings.
1957...Abilene State Hospital became Abilene State School and was converted to a residential home for people with developmental disabilities. (Photo circa mid-50s)
1963...The school discontinued livestock operations.
1964...Fifteen single-story units replaced the original structures.
Today...The school is inside the city limits, utilizing only 223 acres, surrounded by residential areas, a lake and a city park.
Approximately 242 persons live in 20 residential units. Each unit houses from 6 to 21 residents. There are usually two to four people in each bedroom. Eight of the homes are designed with individual bedrooms. Some homes have family-style dining with some meals prepared in the resident kitchens. This provides learning opportunities in food preparation, nutrition, cleaning and other life skills.
Employing approximately 1,200 people, funded with state and federal dollars, the facility is ranked as the city's fourth largest employer.[1]

In 1915, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 73 to create Austin State School, the first facility specifically for citizens with mental retardation. Two years later, Texas opened the State Colony for the Feeble-minded, which was renamed the Austin State School in 1925. The initial capacity of the school was 65 residents, primarily female, but over the years it became home to more than 2,000 residents with everything from a working dairy to a hospital on its 95 acres.
In 1965, the passage of the Texas Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act authorized the creation of at least one community-based mental retardation center per county. These centers allowed persons with more moderate retardation, especially children, to live with their families. Increasingly, the state schools housed people with severe retardation and people with multiple disabilities, most of whom were adults. The 1970s saw improvements in the staff ratios and the development of community living options and life skills training.
By 1974, the Austin State School reduced its population to 1,400 residents. Today, the Austin State School serves 436 residents who live on campus. Staff provides expanded training, educational, medical, recreational, psychological and social services.

Texas,Denton State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Denton_State_School,1957.0,1959.0,1960.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"In 1957, after a vigorous lobbying effort by the Denton Chamber of Commerce, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation chose Denton as the site for the state school because of the city's proximity to Dallas and Fort Worth and because of its universities-Texas Woman's University, which at that time had the largest nursing program in the state, and North Texas State Teachers College (now the University of North Texas), which had the largest teacher-training facility in Texas. Another influence on the department's decision was the city's pledge to donate land for the school. In thirty-four days during November and December of 1957, 2,000 Denton residents contributed $102,000 to a Mental School Cash Campaign conducted by the city's chamber of commerce.
Construction of the school began on March 7, 1959, and was completed in July 1960. Originally, the school accepted only citizens of Texas between the ages of six and twenty-one who had IQs of seventy or below. By 1980, however, the age restriction had been removed. E. W. (Ed) Killian, a North Texas State graduate, was the school's first superintendent. During Killian's twenty-year tenure, the number of residents of the school increased, as did the number of facilities and programs designed for their care. In 1994 the school had more than sixty buildings-including residential facilities leased off-campus-and 2,000 employees serving 670 residents and a large number of off-campus clients. School programs included vocational services and early childhood intervention. The school also directed an outreach community service with facilities in twelve counties. In addition, Denton's foster grandparent program provides a means for senior citizens to give one-to-one attention to residents at the school. The Texas Department of Human Resources (now the Texas Department Of Human Services) and the Texas Education Agency provided funds to the school. Although well over 90 percent of the school's income came from the state, the school also received financial support from the United States departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Education.

The barracks were remodeled to serve as dormitories. The site is in the East Texas piney woods. The Texas State Hospitals and Special Schools Board formally accepted title to the property in 1962. In 1970 the maximum capacity of the school was increased to 1,000, five new buildings and two dormitories were added, and the physical-therapy program was expanded.
The school also began a joint program with Angelina College to provide a two-year degree program for technicians in mental retardation. At the end of 1993 500 clients lived at Lufkin State School. The school offers residential care, occupational and physical therapy, schooling, and recreation. Housing units group students by age and degree of retardation and ambulatory ability. The school has an infirmary, a dental complex, day rooms, two full-time pharmacists, and its own independent school district, housed in an educational building. All teachers at the school are trained in special education. Class sizes are three to seven students, with one teacher and one aide for each class. Basketball and softball teams have been organized. Clients can participate in a work program and receive a prorated amount of a normal wage. Lufkin State School is known for its splinting program, carried out to prevent deformities. The school serves twenty-seven East Texas counties.[1]",,"Lufkin, TX",,,1962,,1000,500,1000,0
Texas,Mexia State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mexia_State_School,,,1946.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Mexia State School and Home,"Mexia State School, originally a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, was opened in 1946 as a home for senile women, who were transferred there from overcrowded state hospitals. By 1951 it had 601 aged women, 121 aged men and 387 mentally retarded boys and girls and was called Mexia State School and Home. In November 1951 all the men were transferred to the Texas Confederate Home, and by 1958 all except the students had been transferred to other institutions. Known now as the Mexia State School, it became one of the first schools to be selected by the Texas Education Agency to establish a vocational rehabilitation program for persons with learning disabilities. This program was one result of 1965 state legislation that established the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and that led to reforms in treatment. Rehabilitation programs were designed to enable clients to function in mainstream society and to enter the job market; such programs emphasized the use of outpatient treatment, outreach and counseling services, recreational programs, vocational workshops, and special education courses. Long-term institutionalization of clients was used only as a last resort.
By 1970 the school had implemented a work-opportunity program that provided assembly-work jobs for some 250 people. Off-campus employment opportunities in furniture repair were available at the Cen-Tex Sheltered Workshop; there were also programs in horticulture, mechanics, and construction. Recreational classes were held in a new campus gymnasium. The number of students at Mexia State School decreased, as it did at other such schools, with the greater emphasis on deinstitutionalization and keeping clients in mainstream society. In 1970 there were 2,600 students at Mexia, but by 1992 there were 349.
In 1966 the three top officials of the school resigned after an investigation by the state auditor and the Texas Rangers. On March 30, 1988, the Texas Association for Retarded Citizens claimed that the welfare of residents had been seriously jeopardized and called for the release of an investigation report by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. There was a formal reprimand of the school superintendent, who resigned but remained an employee in another capacity. The matter of the release of information was referred to the state attorney general. Later that year, the Texas Observer printed various reports of physical abuse, medical malpractice, and faulty recordkeeping. The Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation acknowledged the truth of the reports, including sexual assaults and unexplained deaths. In 1992 the school was almost closed for budgetary reasons but was saved by Governor Ann Richards.",,,,2600 in 1970,1946,,,,2600,0

The school, located on a 242-acre site on a bend of the Brazos River north of Richmond, was constructed in phases, with the first phase to provide accommodations for 500 students. The first 450 were admitted in April 1968. The school serves children and youths, but primarily adults in a fifteen-county area along the Gulf Coast from Orange County to Matagorda County. Residents are assigned to seven units in eleven buildings, depending on the severity of their mental disability. Plans were to house 1,500 when the school was completed, but this enrollment has never been reached because of the department's increasing emphasis on deinstitutionalization. Richmond State School had 1,023 students in 1980, 755 in 1990, and 700 in 1994. The school offers an intensive physical-therapy program daily. On March 26, 1992, the Russell Shearn Moody Riding Arena, the Reva Williams Petting Zoo, and the Jesse H. Jones Wing of the Rehabilitation and Therapeutic Center opened. The result is one of the most comprehensive hippotherapy (physical, speech, and occupational therapy using horses) programs in the Southwest. Richmond State School in 1994 was the fourth largest employer in Fort Bend County. Expanded medical, dental, behavioral, and recreation programs have also improved the basic care of the residents.[1]",,"Richmond, TX",,,1968,,,,1023,0

Initially, there were six staff members who provided follow-up care to individuals released from San Antonio State Hospital.
In 1963, the center moved into the abandoned Harlingen airbase hospital building, and in 1965 the name was changed to Harlingen State Mental Health clinic.   By that time, the center had expanded to include day services for people up to 80 years old with a wide range of mental health and chemical addiction problems.
In-patient services with 20 mental health beds were included in 1968.  The center also began to offer alcoholism and drug abuse treatment services.  The following year, the center established outreach centers and clinics in key cities in the service area and the name was changed to Rio Grande State Center.
In 1972, the center added 130 beds for mental retardation residential services with the opening of two dorms on the campus of the South Texas Hospital.  Patients came from all over the state.  The residents participated in Adult Education and Independent Living Skills training on campus and Special Education in public schools.  Residents participated in the Special Olympics, Jaycees, Girls Scouts, and Boy Scouts of America.   Volunteer Services Council organized in 1964 donated a one-bedroom apartment building named after state representative Menton Murray, Sr., to RGSC so families from out-of-town could come visit and have a place to stay overnight.  The Menton Murray, Sr. Clubhouse is presently used by residents 55 years and over as the Retirement Program.  The Volunteer Services Council went on to later build a swimming pool, a nature park and a pavilion for all the residents.  Intellectual Disabilities Services presently offers 110 residential beds certified by Intermediate Care Facilities for Mental Retardation and Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  Many of the residents after intensive independent living skills training graduated into group homes in the community.
In Sept. 1989, a 15-bed Transitional Living Unit was opened.  The unit provided extended service for adults prior to their transferred to group home or back into the community.  This unit primarily served adults with chemical dependency and was closed in 1994.
RGSC was responsible for Community Based Services in the five northern counties of our service area.  Satellite outpatient clinics were located in Kingsville, Alice, San Diego and Falfurrias.  These clinics were separated from RGSC in 1996; however, RGSC continues to provide services to those counties.
July 1991 found the facility opening a new building to provide in-patient mental health services, adjacent to South Texas Hospital. This building named ""Wayne Potter Memorial Building"" in 2004 now accommodates two in-patient treatment units for persons with mental health illness for adults, psychologists, social services, nursing services, and admission offices.  Art work from discharged patients decorates the conference room.
In 1998, RGSC converted 20 adult mental health services beds in Edinburg to a 15-bed adolescent unit for individuals age 12-17.  This unit was closed in 2001 due to lack of funding.
RGSC is one of nine state mental health facilities within the then TDMHMR system.  RGSC serves an 8 county area for inpatient mental health services, and provides long term residential care and active treatment to persons with intellectual disabilities in a 12-county area.  Admissions to the RGSC comply with the provisions of the Texas Mental Health Code and/or Mental Retardation Act, and as such, may be on a voluntary or involuntary basis.   RGSC is in the heart of one of the most economically depressed and medically under-served areas in the United States.  The 8-county area served by RGSC has a population that is 83% Hispanic, 16% Anglo, and 1% other ethnic groups.  The catchment area is approximately 10,000 square miles.   RGSC currently employs approximately 366 employees.
Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation came to an end August 31, 2004 as a result of HB 2292.  As a result, the facility consolidated services with South Texas Hospital, which was then the Texas Department of Health, and the name changed to Rio Grande State Center/South Texas Health Care System.",,"Harlingen, TX",,,1962,,130,,,0
Texas,San Angelo State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=San_Angelo_State_School,1910.0,,1912.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,State Tuberculosis Sanatorium,"San Angelo State School, located on U.S. Highway 87 seventeen miles north of San Angelo, had its origins in a tuberculosis sanatorium that opened in 1912. With the declining need for tuberculosis treatment in later decades, the facility became part of the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation in September 1969 and was known as the San Angelo Center. Originally, adults from other TXMHMR facilities throughout the state were transferred to San Angelo Center. The population peaked at 791 in 1979. Individuals served at that time were ambulatory and primarily diagnosed with mild to moderate retardation. Today's population is 400 with the majority diagnosed profoundly or severely retarded. In 1983 the name was once again changed; the San Angelo Center became the San Angelo State School. Since 1977 550 clients from San Angelo State School have been placed in community-based care.
As of September 1992 the school employed 810 people.For fiscal year 1992–93 the total budget was $15,136,288. SASS is virtually self-sustaining, providing medical, dental, therapeutic, and psychological services, as well as administrative, social, and community services to the 400 men and women who reside at the school. Volunteer Services provides an additional supportive arm for many of the school's programs. The philosophy of San Angelo State School holds that its basic requirement as a residential school is to provide an environment conducive to growth in independent living skills, opportunities for various therapies, and training for each individual according to his needs for growth and development for the total person-physical, social, psychological, and educational. San Angelo State School's goal is to equip each individual for discharge, if possible, for living in a supervised community setting, or, if that is not possible, for functioning at maximum levels in the campus community.

Texas,San Antonio State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=San_Antonio_State_School,1973.0,,1978.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,San Antonio State Supported Living Center,"he San Antonio State School, a long-term residential facility for the mentally retarded, is operated by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. The establishment of the school was due to the efforts of Bexar County Representative Frank Lombardino and a group of San Antonio citizens, who worked hard to convince the Texas Legislature that a state school for the mentally ill was badly needed in their city. The Sixty-fourth Legislature authorized the school in 1973. The bill was written by Sen. Glenn Kothmann of San Antonio, sponsored in the House by Rep. G. J. Sutton of San Antonio, and signed by Governor Dolph Briscoe. In 1977 the legislature appropriated $27.1 million to renovate ten unused buildings of the San Antonio State Chest Hospital and to operate the San Antonio State School for three years. On March 27, 1978, State Representative Bob Vale, a member of the appropriations committee, welcomed 120 children to their new home in San Antonio. The school was initially headed by Dr. Robert Inglis, who also served as superintendent of the San Antonio State Chest Hospital. Dr. Tom Deliganis, formerly dean of occupational and continuing education at Laredo Junior College, was appointed assistant superintendent for the school. Professional staff were hired to provide the services needed: medical, dental, psychological, speech, audiological, direct care, and physical, occupational, and recreational therapy. The $4.8 million renovation of all ten buildings was completed in 1979, providing space for 440 residents, many of whom were coming home to Bexar County and others who had been on a waiting list of 640 persons from the South Texas area.
In July 1982 the TXMHMR board voted to separate the school from the state hospital; the necessary appropriations bill was passed in July 1983. Deliganis was named superintendent of the school, and in September 1983 the facility began operating with its own budget. The school is certified as an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded, which means it meets standards established by the federal government and generates federal funds which are deposited into the general revenue fund of the state of Texas. In November 1990 the school also achieved accreditation by the Accreditation Council on Services for People with Developmental Disabilities, a nationally recognized accrediting agency. Deliganis retired in 1993 and was succeeded by Wilbur Wood, who had served as business manager at Brenham State School and as assistant superintendent for administration at San Antonio State School. By 1994 the school had 324 residents and seven residential living units. Other buildings on campus included a developmental center with a swimming pool and gymnasium, a wheelchair fabrication shop, and administrative and staff development facilities. A supported employment workshop, El Negocio, was located in the business district near the campus.
The school's community services department sponsors six group homes in the local community, gives numerous workshops, and has an early childhood intervention program. Specialized services include rehabilitation optometry, orientation and mobility training, speech therapy, music and movement therapy, fabrication or modification of prescriptive equipment, and a seniors' program for people of retirement age. A community awareness program insures that residents are involved in the community and that other San Antonians participate actively in school activities. The mission of the San Antonio State School is to support the people it serves by enabling them to live productive lives.

Texas,Travis State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Travis_State_School,1933.0,,1934.0,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Austin State School Farm Colony,"In 1933 the Texas legislature established the Austin State School Farm Colony as a branch of the Austin State School. The 241-acre site was on the Colorado River about eight miles east of downtown Austin. It was intended to provide a home for mentally retarded boys who could not further benefit from training at the Austin State School and who were able to do such work as farming, dairying, gardening, and related tasks. The first students were transferred from the Austin State School in October 1934, at which time the colony had only one building. By the mid-1940s the colony had six ward buildings, a cannery, and an administration building, which included storerooms and a sewing room as well as offices; the facility was home to 477 boys. The colony became a separate institution from the Austin State School in 1949. It acquired an additional 195 acres in the late 1950s and built several dormitories to accommodate its increased enrollment.
Farming operations at the facility ceased in the early 1960s, and the institution changed its name to Travis State School in 1962. Ten new ward buildings and service buildings were completed in 1963. In July 1968 the school had 1,800 students, all of whom had been transferred from other institutions. A special-education program was conducted for those students able to benefit from classroom instruction. In 1970 the school received a grant from the Hospital Improvement Project, which made possible the use of a unit system of treatment. A new Vocational Evaluation and Training Center, with a capacity of more than 300 residents, was opened and staffed through a grant from the Texas Rehabilitation Commission. That same year a swimming pool, an administration building, and five full-time physicians were added. School enrollment at the end of 1970 was 1,754. Female students were first admitted in 1973.
The student population declined steadily in the 1970s and 1980s, as the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation implemented plans to integrate some students into community-based programs. The school used a system known as ""behavioral characteristic progression"" to evaluate the training needs of students and to coordinate that training so as to help achieve each student's maximum potential. The Travis State School functioned as an independent school district from 1981 to 1988; after 1988 it relied on the Manor Independent School District to provide academic instruction through its ""mainstreaming"" program. In 1992 the Travis State School had 604 residents and 1,270 employees; the facility had a total of sixty-eight buildings at its 436-acre site. Travis State School was slated for closure in 1995 as part of a settlement for an eighteen-year-old federal suit against the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.

A tract of ninety-five acres was purchased for the site of the institution, and a board of trustees, made up of three citizens, was appointed by Governor William P. Hobby. About 1930 the Board of Control was placed in charge of the home. The name was changed to Waco State Home by the Forty-fifth Legislature. In 1945 there were 276 boys and girls enrolled at the home and capacity was 364. Children between four and sixteen years of age, adjudged by district courts to be dependent or neglected, were admitted to the home for care, education, and training, with ""preference to those children of tender age,"" according to law.
No mentally or physically handicapped child was accepted, and no child who was known to have violated the law habitually was admitted. Care of indigents was free, while transportation, clothing, and a charge of not more than $5.00 per week were required of children having sufficient estates or persons legally liable for their support who were financially able to pay. All admissions and discharges were handled through a sociologist. Adoptions from the home were permitted. Educational, religious, and physical training was given to the students. The home lay within an independent school district, and its school was conducted on the grounds with the support of the state school apportionment.
Upon completion of the eight grades taught at the home, children entered Waco High School. The older boys assisted with farm, garden, and dairy work, and the older girls with laundry, housekeeping, and dining room. Children were permitted to earn small sums of money and were allowed personal ownership. A complete medical history of each child was kept. In addition to the original tract purchased, the home leased a 235-acre farm. Equipment and buildings, including a separate hospital, were modern. E. B. McMordie, the first superintendent, was followed by Miss Jennie Burleson, Judge R. R. Patterson, and Arthur C. Wiebusch. Ben S. Peek became superintendent in 1943. Waco State Home was placed under the administration of the Texas Youth Commission by the Fifty-fifth Texas Legislature.
On August 31, 1965, the multiservice program of the home was caring for 288 children. Of this number 239 were in residence at the home, 10 were in paid foster homes, and 38 were either with relatives on temporary home trial placements, in preadoptive placements, in free foster homes, in job placements, or in college. In 1970 there were 300 children in the home, and those of scholastic age attended Waco public schools on an annual contract basis, rather than attending school on the grounds. The superintendent at that time was J. Ludwick. In 1979 the Texas Youth Commission transferred control of the Waco State Home to the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. MHMR reorganized the facility into a treatment center for emotionally disturbed children named the Waco Center for Youth.[1]

Not until 1945, however, did the legislature appropriate funds for such a facility. In August 1946 the Board of Control entered into a lease agreement with the federal government for use of the former prisoner of war camp near Brady, McCulloch County. Brady State School for Negro Girls opened to students in February 1947. By the end of August 1947 forty-eight girls had been admitted. Before the establishment of the Brady school, there was no facility in the state that would admit delinquent black girls.
When the school came under the direction of the State Youth Development Council in 1949, some improvements to the Brady site had been made, but the expense of operating a small school in a facility designed for several thousand prisoners prompted the council to seek a more suitable location. In 1950, in an effort to cut expenses and to be near a larger black population, the school was moved to a 125-acre farm near Crockett in Houston County. Crockett State School for Girls, which was called the Colored Girls Training School at Crockett until the institution was integrated in 1966, was placed under the administration of the Texas Youth Council in 1957. In addition to academic courses, the educational program included sewing, housekeeping, child care, and cooking, as well as vocational courses in cosmetology and janitorial work. The school had an enrollment of 209 in 1972 but closed in 1973. Its name was changed to Crockett State Home on December 13, 1973, and the facility was used as a home and educational center for dependent and neglected children until 1975.
In 1975 Crockett State School reopened as a correctional institution for boys and had a capacity of about a hundred students. Its accredited education program included academic courses and work in horticulture, auto mechanics, and shop. In the late 1980s the legislature appropriated funds to expand the facility in order to provide relief for overcrowded conditions at other schools. Crockett State School had an enrollment of 148 in June 1991.

Girls between the ages of eight and seventeen are sent to the institution by court order. The school, originally called the Texas State Training School for Girls, was authorized by the Thirty-third Legislature, which appropriated $25,000 for construction. Under the direction of its first superintendent, Dr. Carrie Weaver Smith (1916–25), the school sought to rehabilitate delinquent girls and stressed ""character building, formation of habits of self-control and stability, better understanding of spiritual values and . . . an ability to cope with present social conditions,"" as well as providing an education emphasizing vocational skills.
The school, located on a 160-acre tract just east of Gainesville, began with four dormitories and a superintendent's residence. By 1948, when enrollment reached 198, it took on its present name. At that time the campus included seven brick cottages, five frame houses for the families of staff members, and a number of other buildings including a gymnasium, a hospital, a school building with a cafeteria and an auditorium, a beauty parlor, and a laundry. From the beginning the school has been relatively self-sufficient; food for the girls and staff is grown on 100 to 160 acres.
The Fifty-fifth Legislature transferred control of the school from the State Board of Control to the Texas Youth Council (now the Texas Youth Commission). By the mid-1960s 364 students attended the Gainesville institution, and in the early 1970s 390 girls were enrolled. Extensive renovation of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, including a security-treatment cottage, made the school ""one of the finest training institutions for delinquent females in America."" In 1991 the Gainesville State School for Girls housed 257 students, and Jerry Day was the superintendent. In 1974 the school became a coeducational juvenile correctional facility. In 1979 the Gatesville State School for Boys closed, and Gainesville took some students previously at Gatesville. In 1988 the facility began to only house boys. In 1997 Gainesville was a TYC facility for nonviolent offenders.Today Gainesville is a maximum security facility and is fenced. As of 2012 it is the largest juvenile correctional facility in Texas. As of 2012 it houses 270 teenagers. Many of them are 17 and 18 years old.

It was established by the Texas legislature in 1887 and opened in January 1889 as the House of Correction and Reformatory, a division of the Texas penal system. Ben E. McCulloch served as the first superintendent of the facility, which housed sixty-eight boys who had formerly been incarcerated with adult felons. The legislature changed the school's name to State Institution for the Training of Juveniles in 1909 and established a five-member board of trustees to administer the institution. A 1913 law changed the school's name to State Juvenile Training School, and in 1919 a newly established state Board of Control assumed management of the school. The legislature renamed the facility Gatesville State School for Boys in 1939. By 1940 the school housed 767 males who were under the age of seventeen at the time a court committed them to the institution. The residents attended academic and vocational classes and engaged in a variety of farming activities on a 900-acre tract of state land and 2,700 acres of leased land. A parole system that rewarded good behavior permitted the release of certain inmates to private sponsors.
The State Youth Development Council began administration of Gatesville State School for Boys in 1949, and the facility enrolled 406 boys in 1950. In 1957 the new Texas Youth Council (later the Texas Youth Commissionqv) replaced the Youth Development Council. By 1970, 1,830 young male offenders housed on five separate units that included the Hilltop, Riverside, Valley, Hackberry, and Terrace schools resided at the institution. The Texas Youth Council operated a separate facility, the Mountain View School for Boys, also near Gatesville, as a maximum security unit for juvenile offenders.
A class-action lawsuit, filed against the Texas Youth Council on behalf of juvenile offenders in 1971, marked the beginning of sweeping changes in the Texas juvenile justice system. The school enrolled approximately 1,500 boys and employed over 250 staff members in 1974, when federal judge William Wayne Justice issued a ruling in Morales v. Turman. The judge ruled that a number of practices at Texas Youth Council facilities constituted cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Staff members routinely dispensed arbitrary and unnecessary punishments that included beating, solitary confinement, the use of chemical crowd-control devices, and the utilization of drugs instead of psychotherapy as a means for controlling behavior. Justice also concluded that the school's staff failed to protect the inmates from violence and personal injury and that most employees lacked proper qualifications and training for supervising troubled youths.
Judge Justice ordered the state to close the Gatesville and Mountain View schools and to develop community alternatives to large juvenile penal institutions. During 1979 the Gatesville State School for Boys closed, and the Texas Youth Council placed juvenile offenders in smaller schools at Brownwood, Crockett, Gainesville, Giddings, and Pyote, as well as at a number of foster and group homes, halfway houses, and residential treatment centers. The Riverside, Valley, and Terrace schools became the Gatesville Unit for female inmates of the Texas Department of Corrections in 1980. The Hilltop and Hackberry schools composed the Hilltop Unit for male felons of the Texas Department of Corrections beginning in 1981. [1]

When that radar base closed in 1963, the Texas Youth Council began work on a children's home to be founded on the location. The buildings, constructed as housing for the air force and radar bases, were still in good shape. In 1965 the Texas legislature appropriated $200,000 for renovation and purchase of equipment to found the institution. West Texas Children's Home of Pyote opened for dependent and neglected children in 1966. In the early 1980s the home changed from an orphanage to a state school for male status offenders.

Texas,Waco VA Medical Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Waco_VA_Medical_Center,,,1932.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"The Veterans Administration Medical Center at Waco opened on May 8, 1932, at a 508-acre site five miles south of the city in what became the Beverly Hills community. Its initial capacity was 308 patients. The facility was expanded in 1939 to include bed space for 1,151 patients and again during World War II; its capacity was 2,040 by 1945. It was one of the first Veterans Administration facilities to have an approved residency program and in the 1940s was the only one in the state devoted entirely to the treatment of mental illnesses.
In 1932 the Waco VA included a 508-acre reservation with a full time working farm. The farm had 262 acres under cultivation including a vegetable garden, fruit orchard, hay and grain crops. Farm animals including a herd of 126 pigs and a flock of 63 sheep were feed and slaughtered on the reservation producing up to 1,000 pound of pork or lamb per week for subsistence purposes. Pigeons, rabbits, turkeys, geese, pheasant and quail were also raised on the farm. A portion of the original farm was awarded to the Waco Independent School District and was designated as Veterans Field for athletic events. This original farm land was also developed into a municipal golf course.
To process the food, the hospital had a modern “ice plant” furnishing cold storage for kitchens and bulk supplies. The “ice plant” had a capacity of manufacturing 2,400 pounds of ice daily. In addition, the hospital operated a laundry and fire department. Clinical services on the reservation included an “industrial therapy program” to help rehabilitate selected patients to their highest level of functioning. The therapy included work assignments to the grounds, farm, slaughter house, laundry, sewing and upholstery shops giving patients an opportunity to adjust to the hospital community and prepare them for life supporting skills.
It served as a teaching center for professional education in neuropsychiatry, clinical psychology, and psychiatric nursing. The opening of other VA hospitals in the state took some pressure off of the Waco facility. By 1972 the center was able to reduce its available bed space to 1,184.
During the 1970s and 1980s the laundry, which served three medical centers, was expanded and renovated; a new warehouse and a dietetics building were added; and the two buildings were renovated. In 1990 the medical center had 684 hospital beds and 160 nursing home beds; 340 additional beds were out of service because of construction projects. The hospital's medical programs included a day treatment center, a mental hygiene clinic, rehabilitation for alcoholics and the blind, and a community residential-care program. The center also had the state's only inpatient post-traumatic stress unit.
In the 1990s the hospital expected to complete the renovation of two more medical buildings, an admissions and canteen area, and a new plant to air-condition the entire facility. The buildings are red brick structures featuring clay tile, dressed stonework, and ornate light fixtures of the Mediterranean Revival style. The center was proposed as a national historic site in 1991.",,"Waco, TX",Mediterranean Revival,,1932,,684,,2040,0

It was located between Old East Dallas and North Dallas on the north side of what is now Exall Park (est. 1914), not far from present-day Baylor University Medical Center. The hospital had 110 beds at opening, and was served by the nurses of the Roman Catholic Order – the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. Several expansions were made to the site over its 70 year history – including a School of Nursing building erected in 1922, a School of Medical Technology, student dorm rooms, and clinics.
The hospital reflected the latest in features for its time, such as elevators, electric and gas lights, radiators, fireplaces, dumbwaiters, and bathrooms with hot and cold running water. Stately Victorian-style verandas allowed patients to benefit from fresh air and sunshine, believed to have important healing properties. A listing in the Dallas Social Directory said costs for care ranged from $1 to $5 per day and that the aim of the sisters was to “relieve suffering humanity, regardless of faith.”
The original buildings at St. Paul were demolished in 1968 following the completion and move to the Southwestern Medical Center Campus on Harry Hines Boulevard in 1964.",1964,,,,1896,1968,110,,,0

“Timberlawn is for the maladjusted wealthy bourgeoisie,” as stated in a Texas Monthly article in 1976. The hospital was acquired by UHS in 1997. Many comments indicate the place was problematic long before and not the place for the ‘maladjusted wealthy’ people anymore.
In 2016 a patient killed psychiatrist Dr. Ruth MarDock due to lack of security. There were also claims that patients were given psychoactive medication without showing signs of aggression or agitation in order to silence them. Violent fights among patients, dirty conditions and medical records issues were not helping the situation either.

Texas,Bexar County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bexar_County_Poor_Farm,1849.0,,1857.0,Demolished,Single Building,,Bexar County Poor Farm and Hospital | Bexar County Home for the Aged | Robert Green Memorial Hospital (TB),"On November 21, 1849, the County Commissioners Court passed an order making it the duty of the court to support and bury indigents of the county. The county and city were to maintain and bury their paupers.  Methods were mapped out on how to take care of the poor in San Antonio in February 1854. This led to the establishment of Bexar County Poorhouse. Bexar County Poor Farm was established on Farm Road off of Southton Road in San Antonio, Texas in 1857. Bexar County Poor Farm was first known as Bexar County Poorhouse before becoming Bexar County Poor Farm. County officials established Bexar County Poor Farm for the purpose of housing the poor and indigent paupers from the area and providing housing for indigent people. The Bexar County Poor Farm facility was a 3 story wooden structure with a basement built in 1856 and opened in 1857. Small one room structures were used for tuberculosis patients. The rooms were small and isolated from the other charges along with everyone else. Residents who were healthy and able were expected to work on the property.
In March of 1875, the county published the rules of the poor-house in the minutes which provide excellent details about what they required supervisors to do along with some basic regulations concerning the poor. The rules required the superintendent of the poor farm to keep full records of all inmates of the poor farm. This included name, age, nativity, trade, sex, marital status, citizenship, date of admission, and cause of pauperism. They also had to keep full accounts of all funds spent on food, clothing and other supplies. The county physician had to examine each pauper before admittance to the poor farm. If found contagious of any disease dangerous to life or health, the county would not admit them. Upon admittance paupers were bathed and provided with new clothes.
Bexar County Poor Farm had a number of problems. Complaints of poor care of the residents and lack of food were a common problem. Staff were eating well and the charges were not. Mistreatment of charges often went unreported. Gruesome deaths occurred in such an unsettling manner at the Poor Farm. For instance, pauper named Henry Pusch won a bet. Part of the deal for that bet was that he had to hang himself. There were early attempts of selling the Bexar County Poor Farm beginning in the early 20th century. In 1909, efforts were made later to remove the poor house burials to the City Cemetery in hopes of securing a buyer. A county judge attempted to sell the property in an effort to relocate charges to an existing County Poor House on 100 acres outside of the city limits on Southton Road. However the property was not sold at that time.
In the middle of 1913, San Antonio Light reported the property was approximately 18 acres including the cemetery which was to be sold or leveled. Bexar County had already begun removing bodies from the cemetery on the old Poor Farm cemetery. Judge Phil Shook sought to sell the old poor farm, having in mind the construction of a building on the new farm. Judge Shook believed that the 18 acres of the old place ought to bring at least $1,000 per acre, but the best offer he could secure was $12,000. In 1914, 110 acres worth of land were purchased from H. C. Feldman and Cheryl Neese for the sum of $12,932.40 dollars. An additional 10 acres were purchased for staff housing on the end of Farm Road for more than $1,000 dollars.
Bexar County Poorhouse was moved from Jones Avenue to an existing poor farm on Southton Road in 1916. Bexar County Poor Farm relocated to HFTA replaced the dilapidated wooden structure with a Colonial style building. The wooden structure served as a hospital facility during the pre-Civil War era during the same year. The new facility was a Colonial style building on beautiful grounds in spite of politics and the dark history surrounding the property. Over the course of several years, several hospitals, detention facilities, and schools were located on the same property. Southton Sanatorium, Home For The Aged, Bexar County Boys Home, Bexar County Girls Home, Bexar County Poor House, Southton Convalescent Home, Southton Boys Home, Southton Tuberculosis Hospital, and Bexar County Convalescent Sanatorium. The reason for this is because the county believed it would be easier to keep all the 'undesirables' in one location. African-Americans diagnosed as mentally insane were housed in the Bexar County Poor House since the crowded state asylum at Austin and San Antonio refused to accept black patients.
When Bexar County Poor Farm closed in 1968, the people who had lived there had no other place to go. Many were dispersed to nursing homes, halfway houses, and to the medical center at Robert B. Green Hospital (then Bexar County Hospital). Tuberculosis patients were transferred to the medical center at Robert B. Green Hospital (then Bexar County Hospital). Elderly patients were transported to the new floor of Robert B. Green Hospital later during the summer of 1968. In August of 1969, Bexar County offered land south of the city that was once the county farm and Southton Boys Home (Bexar County Boys Home) for sale. University of Texas - San Antonio had announced plans on reusing the old Bexar County Poor Farm property as a college campus. The old Home For The Aged building would serve as an administration building for the college campus.
The property had sat abandoned for decades before being repurposed. The property was soon taken over by nature and greenery. The property was reported as still abandoned in 1996. Reasons as to why have never been made public. In 2011, the former property of Bexar County Poor Farm was repurposed as the Bexar County Police Training Facility. It is now home to a shooting range owned by Bexar County (Bexar County Police). The land is managed by Bexar County Public Works.",1968,"San Antonio, TX",,,1857,1968,,,,0

Texas,"Dallas County Poor Farm, TX","https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dallas_County_Poor_Farm,_TX",1876.0,,1878.0,Demolished,Single Building,,Dallas City-County Convalescent Center,"By 1876 the Dallas County Commissioners decided the county needed a poor farm. The site that was selected was 339 acres owned by W. J. Keller south of the Dallas City limits, near the town of Hutchins. The need for some facility to care for the destitute members of the county was recognized for many years. The presiding judge in September 1876 was Nat M. Burford (county). In January 1877 the arrangement was made to purchase the land for the poor farm. By December 1877 a financial report was furnished by N. O. McAdams, who had been the Sheriff of Dallas County from 1862 to 1866 and was now one of the County Commissioners (1875-1894).
The farm was designed to provide for the paupers in the county by furnishing some sort of housing, and those that were able worked in the fields raising crops. The vegetable were used on the farm and also sold for cash. Supplies were bought from local merchants such as Sanger Brothers, and a barrel of navy beans from the firm of Wallace and Waggener. B. D. Atwell had a store in Hutchins and sold a bill of goods for $7.96. The court (commissioners) authorized payment in that amount. Some of the indigent were also law breakers and a jail was built on the property in 1883. The contract was awarded to A. Browlee on March 28. J. A. Kinnon was the superintendent in 1883 and had to hire laborers to pick the cotton. In 1884 the crop was sold for $1,868.45. The convicts were paid $1 per day and discharged after working their sentence out.
Although it was presumed the poor farm was only available to old people, in 1900 children were removed from the premises and sent to St. Matthews home for children in south Dallas on Gould Street. Many paupers died there and were buried at nearby Hutchens. From the very first, the records refer to the doctors who were associated with the farm. In 1879 Dr. George S. Coleman was hired and instructed to visit as early as possible each day. Another early doctor was Wayne Sims in 1880. Dr. A. W. Carnes was hired at a salary of $20 per month.
In the late 1940’s the poor farm was changed to the Dallas City-County Convalescent Center. The sturdy red brick buildings were demolished when the Loop 635 (LBJ Freeway) was built. The property that remains is now used for Road and Bridge District 3 shops under Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price. The Dallas County Juvenile Center is on part of the land.",1948,"Hutchins, TX",,,1877,,,,,0

Texas,El Paso County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=El_Paso_County_Poor_Farm,,,1915.0,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Rio Vista Farm,"Established in 1915 as El Paso’s second poor farm, Rio Vista Farm flourished through the Great Depression in 1929 and began hosting an array of public welfare programs shortly afterward. It served as a temporary base for a Civilian Conservation Corps unit in 1936 and as the reception and processing center for the Bracero Program from 1951 to 1964, when it closed. Unlike most Texas poor farms of the time, Rio Vista’s familial model welcomed and accepted neglected children in addition to the indigent adult population, sheltering hundreds of them throughout its operating years.
From the early 1980s until the mid-1990s, part of the site was used by El Paso County Sheriff's Office as a training academy. Today, a few of the historic buildings are occupied by the City of Socorro’s Administration Offices and Rio Vista Community Center. Of the remaining 18 buildings, only 5 have been maintained and are in use.

It was located about two miles east of the town on Cedar Creek. Mr. John Rankin was awarded the contract for taking care of the paupers who wished to go to the house. Any person who applied for assistance from the county was ordered there. Mr. Rankin was paid $11.50 per month for the care and feeding of up to ten persons. If there were more than ten people in residence he was paid an extra $8.00. Rankin was also allowed $9.00 for each one that he buried. The house was a one-story building containing eight rooms for the residents. The house was arranged so that the blacks were separated from the whites and the men were separated from the women. The first group of residents to arrive at the poor house was two white women, three black women and two black men. Many of the residents were in the closing years of their lives, enfeebled with age and unable to sustain themselves. Most of the residents had suffered lives of toil and struggle and were now dependent upon the kindness of strangers for their welfare.
Mr. Rankin hired Mrs. Drennon and her daughter to attend to the house and make sure that it was kept clean. The ladies also did all the cooking and tended to the residents when they were ill. After the editor of the La Grange Journal toured the new facility he stated in the paper "" we were very much gratified to find that the house was as clean as a new pin and the beds looked clean and comfortable. Mrs. Drennon and Mr. Rankin are evidently doing their duty by the unfortunate persons who have been placed in their charge."" Two and a half acres of ground enclosed the area around the house. In this space the residents grew many vegetables including tomatoes, onions, beans, peas, corn and Irish potatoes. The county furnished the residents with all the bacon they could eat plus some molasses and biscuits at least once a week.
In 1920, the farm was known as the Fayette County Poor House Hospital and Asylum. Arnold Prause was the manager. He lived there with his wife, Annie, and three children. At the time of the census in January, there were 22 inmates. By 1940, there were only five inmates, and Albert T. Bardin (Alvy) was still the manager for the County Hospital and Poor Farm. In actuality, it was more like a nursing home/assisted living facility than a hospital for the elderly and feeble, and a boarding house for those who were able-bodied and homeless. There were no skilled medical workers taking care of the sick. More than likely, if they needed medical care, the county medical officer (physician) was asked to tend to them. The original poor farm inmate buildings burned in a fire in 1940.  A new building was constructed with large yellow bricks and is located off S. Reynolds St. This property now belongs to the La Grange Economic Development Corporation.",1950s,"La Grange, TX",,,1881,,,,22,0

Texas,Harris County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Harris_County_Poor_Farm,,,1882.0,Demolished,Single Building,,Harris County Home | Harris County Home for the Aged,"In 1882 Harris County Commissioners Court ordered an assessment of the feasibility of a Poor Farm and by November 1882 the first Harris County Poor Farm and County Hospital was opened on land located near White Oak Bayou. As the County grew, the Poor Farm was relocated to property that is now part of West University. It was at this location that Harris County opened the first cemetery designated for paupers. In 1917 Commissioners Court decided to change the name of the Harris County Poor Farm to the Harris County Home.20 However, the name change did not catch on and this location continued to be referred to as the Poor Farm.
It was during 1919 that Harris County Commissioners began to consider moving the Harris County Home and Cemetery to a new location. The County purchased 100 acres on Beaumont
Highway and Oates Road in July 1921 (the Beaumont Highway was then known as Crosby Road) from E. R. and Alice Jones. When the new location opened the name of The Harris County Home was changed to The Harris County Home for the Aged. Throughout Commissioner Court Minutes and other documents from the early 1920’s the Home for the Aged would still be referred to by such names as the County Home, the County Old Folks Home and other variations. In June of 1929 Commissioners Court determined that the Harris County Home for the Aged would be
administered by the Juvenile Probation Department.
According to newspapers in 1937, there was a great deal of discussion pertaining to the future of the Home for the Aged in light of the Social Security Act of 1935. It was thought that all inmates of the Home could qualify for a pension and then obtain placement in local residential establishments. However, one stipulation of the Social Security Act was that anyone who was already residing in a governmental institution would not qualify for a pension. Therefore the Home for the Aged stayed open for approximately 20 more years. From 1937 until 1958 Mr. Charles B. Green supervised the Harris County Home for the Aged and the adjacent cemetery. He lived on the property with his family, including a toddler
grandson named Jim Green. The Harris County Home consisted of a main house where white inmates and some staff resided. The main house also included a hospital ward with
approximately twenty beds and a convalescent ward with several more beds. While the hospital convalescent wards were located in the main house, they were separated from the regular living quarters. There was a separate building for African American inmates. There was also a separate building for staff that lived on the premises.
In 1958, administration of the Harris County Home for the Aged along with the Harris County Cemetery was turned over to the newly designated Harris County Welfare Department. The Home was closed and other housing arrangements were found for all inmates. Once the Home was closed, a total of 18 acres were set aside for the Cemetery. On February 9, 1959,
administration for the Cemetery was left with the Harris County Welfare Department. The remaining land where the Home for the Aged, farm and adjacent buildings were located was all eventually sold.",1958,"Houston, TX",,,1882,1958,20,,,0

Texas,Travis County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Travis_County_Poor_Farm,,,1879.0,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The Travis County Poor Farm was established by the Travis County Commissioners Court in 1879. Based on the tradition of the almshouse, the poor farm was a means for destitute inhabitants to live and work in an agrarian-based institutionalized setting.  A superintendent ran the operations of the farm; paid a base salary, he was in charge of hiring help, organizing the planting of crops, and keeping written records of all poor farm activity.
Those who came or were sent to poor farms, unless physically disabled, were expected to work the land.  The primary purpose of the farming was to provide the inhabitants with food.  Provisions supported only a bare existence, and in general, it was the most desperate who populated such facilities. Inhabitants included the elderly and infirm, inmates who were allowed to work off their fines or sentences, and in some cases even families, particularly mothers with small children.
The Travis County Poor Farm was first located seven miles north of Austin, near the intersection of today’s Spicewood Springs and Mopac. Due to growth in the city, around 1908 the poor farm was relocated to near present-day Tarrytown, near the intersection of 24th and Windsor. While no known photographs exist of the poor farm, records indicate that the main building held a kitchen; a storeroom for supplies, groceries, and clothing; a dining room; and quarters for the staff.  Outbuildings included cottages for the elderly and infirm, a separate guarded building for inmates, and a large barn.
The onset of the Great Depression and a myriad of federal welfare and relief laws in the 1930s contributed to the decline of the poor farm throughout Texas. Populations at such institutions gradually dropped off as better-funded types of relief were made available. Travis County, rapidly growing and evolving from a rural county to an urban one, discontinued its poor farm in 1936, and portions of the land were auctioned off in 1939.

The site where the Health Center stands today was activated in 1943 as Camp Fannin, a World War II infantry training base, where more than 100,000 men a year were prepared for combat. During the height of the war, troop capacity was more than 18,000 soldiers with 1,074 hospital beds. It also served as a camp for prisoners of war. In 1946 Camp Fannin was closed. A year later the Fiftieth Texas Legislature authorized the purchase of the site from the federal government and chartered the East Texas Tuberculosis Sanatorium. The transaction involved surface rights to 614 acres and the existing wood barracks, which were used to house the 1,000-bed hospital.
The sanatorium's primary mission was to treat tuberculosis patients in East Texas. Renovation of the sanatorium was begun in 1948, and a year later 122 patients arrived by train from a state tuberculosis facility in Kerrville. The first patients slept on cots until 1952, when the first hospital beds were issued. The sanatorium was renamed the East Texas Tuberculosis Hospital in 1951. In 1957 the hospital underwent major construction. Most of the army barracks were demolished and replaced with a new six-story, 320-bed hospital building.
The Sixty-second Texas Legislature renamed the institution the East Texas Chest Hospital in 1971 and designated it a primary referral facility in Texas for treatment of pulmonary and heart disease. A $17.2 million building and expansion project for a new patient-care annex was begun in 1976 and completed in 1980. In 1980 a new six-story building was erected, and the old building was renovated for use as an administration center.
In 1977 the institution joined the University of Texas System, becoming the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler.

It operated under the Board for Texas State Hospitals and Special Schools and opened in 1955 with a capacity of 518 patients. A follow-up clinic was also operated for indigent patients. The hospital began operating under the State Department of Public Health in 1965.
By 1967 the patient capacity was 234. In 1971 numerous changes affecting the hospital occurred. The Sixty-second Texas Legislature changed its name to Harlingen State Chest Hospital to designate a change in policy. Though it previously treated only tuberculosis patients, the hospital was now authorized to provide treatment for patients with all kinds of chest and respiratory diseases, particularly chronic obstructive lung disease. Efforts were also made to integrate hospital programs with regional programs providing case-finding and follow-up services.
In August 1971 an interagency agreement was made with the Rio Grande State Center for Mental Health and Mental Retardation for the use of buildings and other services. In 1971 the outpatient clinic of Harlingen State Chest Hospital served 7,523 outpatients, and the hospital had a inpatient bed capacity of 262. On September 1, 1983, the hospital was renamed South Texas Hospital, to reflect another expansion in services. In 1993 the hospital provided medical and surgical services for those experiencing such nonacute chronic disease as hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory disorders. The institution has two inpatient units, one for tuberculosis patients and one for medical or surgical patients.

Texas,Homan Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Homan_Sanatorium,,,1907.0,Active,Single Building,,Albert Baldwin Sanatorium and Health Resort | Southwestern General Hospital,"The Albert Baldwin Sanatorium was founded by David Gilmore Baldwin and named after his father. David Baldwin had contracted TB and came from New Orleans to El Paso for appropriate care. Seeing an opportunity to serve a growing influx of TB patients, he purchased a suitable site, and construction of his new facility began in 1905. Baldwin contracted physician Charles M. Hendricks to serve as medical director, and new patients were first admitted on May 1, 1907. In 1909 Hendricks resigned his Baldwin Sanatorium position, and David Baldwin agreed in 1910 to lease and later sell the facility to Homan and a partner, Morton McKinney, and change the name to the Homan Sanatorium.
During the first decades of the twentieth century, numerous other sanatoriums opened in El Paso, but by 1924 Homan Sanitarium was at full capacity, and a new, larger facility was needed. Construction began that year on a suitable plot of land at the intersection of Cotton Avenue and Erie Street. The new Homan Sanatorium opened in June 1925. The $200,000, four-story facility boasted the latest amenities, including 104 private rooms, a “call bell” system for nurses, two elevators, a fourth floor “assembly room” for recreation, and a roof garden. The management team consisted of Homan as medical director, Crimen as superintendent, and physicians W. W. Britton and Ralph Homan as associate medical directors. The original Homan Sanatorium on Grand View Drive was sold to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia, Kansas, in 1927, and the name was changed to St. Joseph’s Sanatorium.
From 1925 to 1932 Homan Sanatorium continued to operate successfully under the handshake partnership forged by Homan and Crimen in 1910. With the onset of the Great Depression, however, with sanatorium facilities experiencing declining numbers of patients, the two partners formalized their professional relationship in May 1932 by incorporating as Homan & Crimen, Inc. In 1936 they sold shares of the corporation to raise funds for the purpose of converting the Homan Sanatorium into a general hospital. Shares were sold to Ralph Homan, a cardiologist and the brother of Robert Homan, and to George Turner, a radiologist and clinical pathologist who would serve on the board as well as operate the hospital’s radiology department and diagnostic laboratory. The new facility, with renovations of approximately $50,000 and a capacity of 125 beds, was named Southwestern General Hospital and officially opened to patients on January 31, 1937.",,"El Paso, TX",,,1925,,125,,,0

Texas,McKnight State Tuberculosis Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=McKnight_State_Tuberculosis_Hospital,,,1912.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,State Tuberculosis Sanatorium | San Angelo State School (Current),"During the first decade of the twentieth century more than 4,000 deaths a year in Texas were attributed to pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1909 the Texas Senate passed a bill creating a TB colony, but it was defeated in the House. In 1911 both houses passed a bill creating two colonies-one for advanced and one for early cases-dedicated to the treatment and education of people infected with TB. Although plans for the former were abandoned, 330 acres was purchased near Carlsbad for the location of the Anti-Tuberculosis Colony No. 1. The first institution of its kind in Texas, the colony provided the isolation to calm the fears of the public, as well as rest and clean air, the only known cure for TB sufferers. Admission was restricted to patients between the ages of six and sixty for a period not to exceed six months. The fifty-seven-bed facility opened with a barbecue and celebration on July 4, 1912. Bascom Lynn, who commuted from San Angelo, was the first superintendent. In 1913 the facility was renamed the State Tuberculosis Sanatorium, and on January 1, 1914, Governor Oscar B. Colquitt appointed Joseph B. McKnight resident superintendent. Under McKnight's leadership the sanatorium expanded for the next thirty-five years. Attracting employees was difficult because of the fear of TB, low wages, and geographic isolation, therefore, the Sanatorium School for Nurses in Texas was organized in 1915 to train the needed staff. The two-year training focused on TB treatment, and nearly all the students were recovering TB patients. The first class of four graduated in 1917 with a R.T.N. degree (registered tuberculosis nurse). In 1920 administration of the sanatorium passed from the Anti-Tuberculosis Commission to the Board of Control.
By the 1930s the facility had treated more than 13,000 patients. From the original four buildings constructed at a cost of $10,000, the facility had grown to thirty-five buildings valued at $1.5 million. In 1930 there were thirteen buildings with 662 patient beds, including 162 beds in the children's Preventorium. The grounds had been expanded to nearly 1,000 acres and included a post office, library, barber shop, dairy, hog farm, butcher shop, bakery, power plant, laundry, printing press with its own newspaper (the Chaser), four water wells, and a school for the children. There were also church services and organized meetings for the Masons, Order of the Eastern Star, bridge club, sewing club, and stamp collectors' club. The complex had grown into a virtually independent community known as Sanatorium. By 1949 Sanatorium had grown to 970 beds with 300 patients on the waiting list. McKnight continued to propose expansions, including a new seventy-five bed dormitory, more employee living quarters, and a twenty-five bed surgery unit to supplement the existing surgical building constructed in 1947–48. Raymond F. Corpe, who was on loan from the United States Public Health Service, had begun to perform thoraco-plastic operations.
The 1950s brought dramatic change to the institution. McKnight, who had become synonymous with the battle against TB, retired in 1950. On June 2, 1951, the Texas legislature renamed the institution the McKnight State Sanatorium. The ancillary operations such as the dairy, hog farm, and the Preventorium were systematically closed during the decade. The new superintendent, Dr. Allison, successfully removed the age-limit restrictions and the ban on readmission. But the biggest change was a result of the changing TB treatment. The old treatments, including bed rest and phrenic nerve paralysis, were increasingly replaced by the thoracic surgery program and such drugs as streptomycin and capreomycin. As a result the institution was renamed the McKnight State Tuberculosis Hospital in 1955.
The length of stay was reduced from 372 days in 1960 to 311 days in 1961, 254 days in 1962, and 204 days in 1963. In the 1963–64 fiscal year the operating expenses of the hospital totaled $1,417,000. The 290 employees cared for a average of 388 patients at an average patient-per-day cost of $9.98. Changes continued in the 1960s. The nursing school, renamed the State Tuberculosis School of Nursing in 1938, closed in 1961 after graduating 501 nurses. The number of TB beds was reduced to 550 and the length of treatment continued to decline due to new drugs and surgery techniques. Staff now numbered around 100, including a chief thoracic surgeon, five resident physicians, and administrative personnel. After treating approximately 50,000 adult and 5,000 juvenile patients, the McKnight State Tuberculosis Hospital was converted to the San Angelo State School in September 1969. Medical techniques and drugs were now successful in more than 90 percent of TB cases, making Sanatorium and other TB institutions superfluous. The mission of the new institution was to serve the needs of mentally retarded men and women.",,"San Angelo, TX",,,1912,1969,970,55000,970,0
