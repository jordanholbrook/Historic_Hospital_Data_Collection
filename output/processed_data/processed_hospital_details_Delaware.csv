Delaware,Delaware State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Delaware_State_Hospital,1889.0,,1891.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Insane Department and Hospital | Delaware Insane Asylum  | Delaware Psychiatric Center,"In the late 1800’s, the New Castle County Trustees of the Poor had erected a facility to house the insane persons of the county, but in 1889 the Legislature felt it would be better to operate the New Castle facility for the benefit of the citizens of the whole state. Thus, for the sum of $75,000, the property was transferred from the custody of the Trustees of the Poor to the custody of a newly created State Board of Trustees of the Insane. In 1891, the Insane Department and Hospital became the Delaware State Hospital at Farnhurst.
Around the turn of the century, pleas to the Legislature for additional buildings went unheeded, so, in 1904, the Trustees took funds from the general hospital fund and erected a new Tuberculosis Building. The Legislature was less than pleased at having their authority usurped and severely chastised the Trustees with new legislation in 1905. The Trustees were flatly prohibited from erecting any new buildings whatsoever, and moreover, any funds received by the Trustees from other than State sources were to be placed in a special emergency fund which was to be used only when appropriated funds were exhausted.
During the early part of this century, there also had been increasing concern over the cohabitation of the criminally insane with patients having less severe psychological problems. This dangerous situation arose due to the desire of the New Castle County Workhouse administration to place their criminally insane prisoners in an institution better suited to handle their special problems. However, the admission of these prisoners to the State Hospital created a difficult situation there as well, by jeopardizing the safety of the other patients. Thus, in 1947, the Trustees were permitted to create a Department of the Criminally Insane to segregate these inmates and address more specifically their individual needs.
In 1964, again to promote more efficient operations, the State Board of Trustees of the Delaware State Hospital was administratively reorganized to become the Board of Trustees for a newly created Department of Mental Health. With the new reorganization, the Trustees now became responsible for the operations of the Governor Bacon Health Center; the Hospital for the Mentally Retarded at Stockley; the Day Care Center at Dover; and the Mental Hygiene Clinic at Fernhook, in addition to the State Hospital.

The cemetery lies at the back of the campus. Individual graves are marked with small numbered stones - there is only one grave marked with a private stone showing a name. There are 778 numbered stones arranged in concentric circles originally, then opening out into a spiral.  The cemetery includes many people who were patients at the hospital and died there, but also includes three hospital employees as well as the stillborn child of a patient.  The cemetery includes two known Civil War veterans: John Cheffins (employee) #104 and Arnold Morris #199, as well as one veteran of the Spanish-American War, William Adkins #427.  Burials date from 1891 to 1983, when the cemetery was closed. In 2015 and 2016, a committee of concerned ""Friends of the spiral Cemetery"" cleaned up and beautified the cemetery, added a memorial with names and grave numbers, a historical marker, and some landscaping, with a dedication ceremony held on May 9, 2016.  (As of 2014, the cemetery records have been public and available online at www.findagrave.com thanks to the tireless efforts of Tedd Cocker.)   The committee that worked to restore the Spiral Cemetery has now turned it's attention to the New Castle County Hospital/Almhouse Cemetery on the Herman Holloway campus.",,"Wilmington, DE",,,1891.0,,,,,0

Ennis Delaware Colony for Feeble Minded Stockley | Delaware State Training School | Stockley Center (Current),"The Delaware Commission for the Feeble Minded was created in March 1917 to establish a home for the care and training of the feeble-minded of Delaware, and to provide for the legal commitment of feeble-minded persons. Whenever a person arrested in this state was thought to be feeble-minded, any relative of the person, or any reputable citizen of the state, at any time before the final disposition of the case, could present to the court a petition saying that the person was feeble-minded and should not be charged. The petition would be verified, filed, and then a rule issued against the parent or guardian of the person. Upon the return of the rule the judge would hear the witnesses in support of the rule, one of whom would be a psychologist or an expert on feeble-mindedness, and would also hear any witnesses in opposition to the rule. If the judge agreed that the person arrested was indeed feeble-minded, he could direct that they be arrested in the custody of the Delaware Commission for the Feeble-Minded.
A 1955 act established the Delaware Colony for the Feeble-Minded at Stockley as the primary state facility for the treatment and maintenance of the feeble-minded. This facility had formerly been the Sussex County Insane Department, also under the control of the Farnhurst administration. The 1955 act served to channel the feeble-minded (mentally retarded) to the Stockley facility and the insane (mentally ill) to the Farnhurst facility, keeping a centralized administration for both.

Delaware,Ferris School for Boys,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ferris_School_for_Boys,1885.0,,1887.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Ferris Industrial School | Ferris School (Current),"Established initially as a private rehabilitative facility, the Ferris School was the brainchild of John Ferris, Jr., a well-respected Wilmington humanitarian. Ferris, in his last will and testament of 1882, designated his cousin, Dr. Caleb Harlan, as the administrator of his estate and bade him employ it “for the benefit of any of the necessary portion of the human family that may come to his knowledge.” He even suggested a “house of refuge” or a place for bettering wayward juveniles as worthwhile projects.
Dr. Harlan took his cousin’s suggestion to heart and drew together some of Wilmington’s most influential citizens to form a loose organization to found such an institution. They purchased a 197-acre plot of land called “Woodside,” which lay just outside Wilmington, and drew up an organizational proposal to be submitted to the Legislature. On March 10, 1885, the act of incorporation was approved, with a governing body of twenty-one managers, including the mayor of Wilmington, the Chief Judge of the New Castle County Superior Court and the President of the New Castle County Levy Court.
Their goals were straightforward; they were to provide care, retraining and rehabilitation of white and negro boys committed by the Delaware courts as delinquent. The rehabilitative program included psychiatric and psychological study; required religious programs; physical examinations and treatment; varied types of recreation; academic training; arts and crafts; and vocational training, including farming, cooking and general kitchen work, laundry operations, painting, carpentry, plumbing, auto repair, and boiler room operation. The age of the child had to be between 9-16 years.
The school, while still privately funded, was plagued by financial difficulties even before the turn of the century. The Board of Trustees asked the Legislature to force the New Castle County Levy Court to help provide support for the inmates, largely because most of the boys had been committed to the institution by the county courts, as a means of accommodating errant boys instead of packing them off to jail. The Levy Court resisted, and in 1898 the case went to the Superior Court which decided in favor of the school.
The appropriation by Levy Court still did not stem the flow of red ink, and in 1919, the Legislature was again petitioned. This time the request was to place control of the facility within state government, the rationale being that state intervention at an earlier age would pre-empt any need for future incarceration. As a result of this request, the state finally accepted responsibility for the facility with its activities being monitored by, ironically, the New Castle County Levy Court.
In 1943, the school’s name officially became the Ferris School for Boys. To better administer the facility, the Youth Services Commission of Delaware was formed in 1957. The Commission was to coordinate the combined activities of the Ferris School, the Kruse School for Girls, and the Detention Home for Juvenile Delinquents. This arrangement lasted until 1969, when the Division of Corrections, within the Department of Health and Social Services, assumed the Commission’s duties. (Note: The members were carried over to a new Council on Youth Services, an advisory group to the Director of the Division of Corrections.)
The Division of Corrections, in 1975, was taken from Department of Health and Social Services to become a wholly independent Department of Corrections. The Ferris School remained there until 1983, when the Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families (RG 1501), a cabinet level agency, was formed. The Ferris School was then placed in this new department, within the Division of Youth Rehabilitation Services.",,"Wilmington, DE",,,1885.0,,,,,1
