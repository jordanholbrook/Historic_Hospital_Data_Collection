Indiana,Central Indiana State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_Indiana_State_Hospital,,1846,1848,Demolished (Mostly),"Kirkbride Plan
Cottage Plan",,Indiana Hospital for the Insane | Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane | Central State Hospital,"Central State Hospital was brought into existence by an Act of the 1844-1845 Indiana General Assembly which provided for ""the procuring of a suitable site for the erection of a State Lunatic Asylum."" The property, consisting of 160 acres of farmland belonging to N. Bolton, was selected due to its proximity to the State Capitol. Purchased at the rate of $33.125 per acre, the property passed to the State of Indiana on August 29, 1845.
An Act approved on January 19, 1846 provided ""That the Commissioners of the Indiana Lunatic Asylum are hereby authorized to cause to be erected upon the grounds heretofore purchased for that purpose, suitable buildings for the use and accommodation of said institution, which shall hereafter be called and known by the name of the Indiana Hospital for the Insane, and also to make such improvements upon and about said grounds as they may think expedient and proper."" To fund the construction, an appropriate of $15,000 was approved ""for the purpose of defraying the expenses incurred under the provisions of this act.""
On May 5, 1846 a contract to begin the construction of ""Old Main"" (Men's Department Building, razed in 1941) was authorized and on November 21, 1848 the first five patients were admitted. Thus Central State Hospital was born. The hospital served the entire state until 1905, by which time additional hospitals had been constructed in Evansville, Logansport, Madison, and Richmond leaving Central State with patients from 38 counties in central Indiana.
The hospital grew to include the massive Seven Steeples building (Women's Department), a farm colony, a Pathology Building for the study and teaching of mental illnesses, and well manicured gardens and fountains. At its peak, the hospital accommodated over 2,500 patients.
With the construction of other mental health facilities the official hospital name changed around 1889 to Central Indiana State Hospital for the Insane to reflect its geographic location in relation to the others. This period is marked by positive change brought about by Superintendent George Edenharter. One of the first pathology laboratories in the nation opened under his leadership in 1896. This state of the art teaching and research facility included a lecture amphitheater, autopsy room, photography room, library, anatomical museum, and research laboratories.
Criminology also made significant strides at the hospital under the direction of Dr. Max Bahr. Bahr’s research focused on the link between crime and mental illness. He developed some of the first forensic psychiatry courses for American lawyers. During his tenure the name of the hospital changed to Central State Hospital (CSH) in 1926.
The pathology department would gain international renown in 1931 when Dr. Walter Bruetsch made significant discoveries in the treatment of syphilis. He discovered that malaria triggered the production of white blood cells that consumed both syphilis and malaria. Prior to his discovery, syphilis had been the largest cause of mental illness. This major breakthrough made significant headway in treating syphilis until the advent of penicillin.
Allegations of abuse & poor living condition concluded that “Over time the abuse cited included unclean rooms, physical and verbal abuse of patients, patient suicides, inadequate nursing staff, too few psychiatrists, beatings, poor administration, patients dying in accidents, rapes, infestation of rats, and patients lying naked amongst their excrement.” In a 1949 Indianapolis Times article entitled “Legislators Walk Among the Living Dead at Central State,” state representatives toured the hospital, describing patients as “skeletonic. Some lie in shapeless lumps under thin, dirty blankets.” The newspaper reported gruesomely that “Some on the tour suggested the infirmaries smelled worse than the Dachau concentration camp near Munich, but having smelled Dachau, too, I can point out one principal difference. The inmates of Dachau were liberated.”
In 1968, the Indianapolis News published a series of articles detailing the hospital’s unsanitary conditions, inspiring multiple former patients and their relatives to report neglect. They claimed they were unable to see a doctor for as long as six months due to personnel shortage. Incidents of neglect occurred into the 1990s, when the drowning of a patient contributed to the hospital’s eventual closing.
By the early 1970s, mоst оf the hospital's ostentatious, Victorian-era buildings were declared unsound аnd razed. The Men's Department Building (a Kirkbride) hаd been demolished іn 1941. Іn theіr place, the state constructed brick buildings оf а nondescript, institutional genre. These modern buildings аnd the medical staff therein continued tо serve the state's mentally ill, until allegations оf patient abuse аnd funding troubles sparked аn effort tо forge new alternatives tо institutionalization which, іn turn, led tо the hospital's closure.
On June 30, 1994 Central State Hospital officially closed its doors after 148 years of service. The State used the land for a variety of purposes for the next decade, including a location for the American Red Cross and the State motor vehicle pool. The old Pathology building was restored and is used as the Indiana Medical History Museum, while a new fire station was constructed along Washington Street. In 2003, the City of Indianapolis purchased the site from the State. The Kirkbrides were demolished many years ago.
As of October, 2015 all of the patient buildings that remained have been demolished and only a handful of older buildings on the westside of the property remain. The administration building is being refurbished for housing and the medical museum remains as well.
As of September 2020 The Unmarked graves on the northwest corner of the property are currently being mapped,through a joint effort between the Indiana Medical History Museum and archaeology students from Ball state university. This effort is a challenge due to a lack of any known burial records.

Indiana,Central State Hospital Farm Colony,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_State_Hospital_Farm_Colony,,,1938 (State Operated),Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Marion County Poor Farm,"In the early 1930’s efforts were made to transfer the Marion County poor farm to the state as part of a deal which involved the Julietta County Insane Hospital. The legislation to make this plan a reality was initially proposed in 1931, although political maneuvering and other delays prevented the transfer until a law was finally passed in 1937, and the 21st and Tibbs Marion County Poor Farm was transferred to the state in 1938. The now former Marion County Poor Farm location continued to be operated by Central State under the designation of the Central State Farm Colony.
An investigation by the Indianapolis News revealed the terrible conditions at the farm colony, in addition to the main Central State campus in early 1968. Reporter Skip Hess visited both locations and reported that rats and cockroaches were infesting both Central State locations, with these creatures roaming the kitchen and wards, both during the day and night. 1968 proved to be a significant year for the former poor farm, now farm colony, as the state moved to close the facility, and deeded the land back to Marion County on October 7, 1968.",1968,"Indianapolis, IN",,,[1938],[1968],[None],[None],[None],0
Indiana,Evansville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Evansville_State_Hospital,,1888,1890,Demolished (Original)Active,Pavilion Plan (Radial),,Woodmere Asylum | Southern Indiana Hospital for the Insane,"In 1883, Indiana's Legislature authorized funding for the construction of a new facility in Evansville to treat mentally ill patients. A secluded, densely wooded farm on Newburgh Road (now Lincoln Avenue), then three miles outside of the city, was selected as the site, and on Oct. 30, 1890, the new hospital admitted its first two patients. Known in its early years as Woodmere (""tranquility in the forest"") The hospital was built on 160 acres of land on Newburgh Road, now known as Lincoln Avenue, between Evansville and Newburgh. The campus quickly expanded, eventually holding nearly 900 acres of what is now the East Side of Evansville, including the land eventually repurposed for Robert Stadium, St. Mary’s Medical Center and Wesselman’s Woods Nature Preserve. Using patient labor, the hospital staffed a working farm, including dairy cows, poultry and an orchard.
A general treatment facility with a long, rich history. Also referred to as ""Woodmere"", Evansville provided solitude and peace for mentally-ill patients. While Central State Hospital was a progressive force in scientific medicine in the early 20th century, Evansville remained largely a custodial institution. On February 9, 1943, a fire set by an attendant destroyed much of the original building, leaving at least two staff members dead and six patients missing. It was replaced later that year by a ""U"" shaped building, referred to as the Continuing Treatment Unit. By the late 1990s a new facility was being built & all the old structures were demolished by 2008. The hospital continues to serve southwestern Indiana in it's new facility.

Indiana,Hospital for Insane Criminals,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hospital_for_Insane_Criminals,1909.0,1910,1912,Demolished,Single Building,,Indiana Hospital for Insane Criminals,"The Indiana Hospital for Insane Criminals was built in the year 1910, entirely by prison labor. It is located in a plot of ground comprising four acres adjacent to the Indiana State Prison. It is surrounded by a brick wall twenty-four feet in height. The building is three stories high, built in the form of a Y. There are thirty-two private rooms on each floor. This particular model of architecture was carried out so that the supervisor on each floor could at all times have
a view of two day rooms, halls, dormitories and dining rooms, from any front location. It is at once apparent to the visitor that the institution partakes of the character of a hospital and a prison. It is equipped with offices, a hydrotherapy, a surgery, a drug room, and a psychological laboratory. All the windows have. bars of the outside basket variety. It was constructed with a view in mind to prevent escapes of the patients. The interior of the building is furnished entirely in terrazzo and this finish makes it very easy for the institution to be kept scrupulously clean.
The institution is under the same Board of Control and Management as the prison, but it is an entirely separate institution. Its medical administration is governed by a medical director who conducts its internal affairs. The attendants of this hospital are men who have had experience as prison guards and as attendants in hospitals for the insane. The wages they receive are about twice the amount of remuneration ordinarily paid this class of help in hospitals for the insane. This enables the administration to secure a better class of attendants than usual.
Discipline is entirely different from that of the prison and conforms to the ordinary ideals of hospital government. Owing to the fact that the majority of the patients have served sentences in prison, their conduct in many respects is more orderly and regular than in civilian hospitals; kindness, gentleness and firmness is the triad of qualifications that make for discipline. An endeavor is made to have the patients understand that they are in a hospital and not a prison. In the day rooms they are allowed books from the library; they have games and musical instruments for their entertainment. They are afforded recreation"" outside the building in the form of ordinary field sports, as baseball, basketball and intensive gardening.

The prison in Michigan City was established in 1860, but in 1909 the state decided it need separate housing for those ""criminally insane"" at Logansport & Central State Hospitals. In 1910 a new building was opened to house those inmates, it could house up to 180 inmates/patients. The inmates were transferred in 1954 to the newly opened Maximum Security Division of the Dr. Norman M. Beatty Memorial Hospital at Westville. The buildings have since been demolished but remains a prison today.

Indiana,Larue D. Carter Memorial Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Larue_D._Carter_Memorial_Hospital,,1948,1952,Demolished,Single Building,,,"After World War 2, the state of Indiana decided it needed a separate facility for with children with psychological illnesses. The hospital was built at the Indiana University School of Medicine near downtown Indianapolis at 1350 West 10th Street for $4,700,000. Construction began in January 1948, with the first patients admitted in July 1952. In later years also housed adults to ease overcrowding at Central State Hospital several miles away. Through the late 1970's the hospital came under scrutiny for patient abuse complaints, it remained open however.  During its tenure, the hospital saw the advent of many new drugs that completely changed the way the mentally ill were medically treated. Soon after the facility opened, thorazine and reserpine came into use. Other aspects of mental health emerged and staff at Larue Carter participated in pioneering research projects that studied autism.
The hospital moved from its previous location in 1996 to the now former Veterans Administration building on Cold Spring Rd. Indiana University demolished the building to make way for the new Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital. As of December 2020 the Cold Spring location is now closed, having its patients transferred to the new ""Neuro-Diagnostic Institute"" on the East side of Indianapolis in spring of 2019.",2020,"Indianapolis, IN",,,1952,2020,,,,0
Indiana,Logansport State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Logansport_State_Hospital,,1884,1888,Active,Cottage Plan,,Longcliffe Asylum | Northern Indiana State Hospital for the Insane,"In 1883 discussions were made concerning opening a state hospital since the state's only mental facility in Indianapolis had become overcrowded. A 160 acre farm was purchased in October 1883 and an additional 121 adjoining acres were donated by the citizens of Cass County. Plans & specifications were submitted May 26, 1884. In the next year the Administration building, a 3-story structure of Victorian architecture was built at the center of the ridge (cliff) in the maple grove. For the next 70 years east & west from the Administration building were to be erected 5 pavilions (wards) arranged in a straight line with fifty feet separation. In the rear of the center buildings was a building to be known as Rear Center. It was designed for offices, assembly room & employees' quarters. Still father to the south was the boiler house, pump house & laundry. A spur of the Terre Haute & Logansport Railroad entered the grounds for rail deliveries.
Only four ward buildings were built on either side of the Administration building. To the east 1-2, 5, 6 & 8-9 for women; A-B, E, F-G, & H-I to the west for men.
Joseph G. Rogers, M.D., was employed by the Board of Commissioners as Medical Superintendent. Dr. Rogers designed the ward buildings and their location. The Rogers family lived on the 2nd floor of the Administration building. The asylum opened its doors to the first patients on July 1, 1888. By the end of the year 309 patients were admitted, 17 of whom were released or died, patient census was 292.
In the 1890s, new admissions averaged 190 persons per year, with 109 discharges & 44 deaths. New ward & service buildings, maintenance repairs, remodeling & ground work were needed. An assembly hall (later chapel) was completed in 1893 at a cost of $10,000. Activities & church services were held there until the 1950s. Within the original Rear Center buildings, the assembly & sewing rooms were combined into the central dining rooms. As the census rose, the need for more beds became more critical. An annex was built to the 2 terminal buildings known as 8-9 & H-I. Ward buildings 3-4 & C-D were finished in 1900.
Medical superintendents Rogers, Terflinger, Dodds & Williams were the administrative officers covering 45 years. Their leadership guided the hospital through some difficult times. Some problems were: inadequate funding, high admission rate & low discharge rate, need for new wards, deteriorated conditions of existing buildings & equipment, new therapies, World War 1, & in the 1930s the depression.
Census in 1910 was 1,001 present; 1,105 enrolled; up 360 from the decade before. Wards 3-4, C-D, the ""tent colony"", ward 10-11 & K were completed.
Throughout the years, farming, livestock & gardening were most important. Cattle, pigs, chickens, turkeys, rabbits & ducks were sources of meat. In early years the ice house was filled each winter with ice cut from the pond on the hospital grounds. A cannery, using patient labor, preserved fruits & vegetables. A root house held potatoes.
The 1910s began with the hospital being overcrowded (2 beds in 1 bed rooms) & caused suspended admission applications. The hospital needed the following: pathology building, open air colony, more land, surgical addition, spiral fire escapes, better phone system & cover for water reservoirs.
Admissions averaging 250 patients per year balanced out discharges & deaths. 89 patients were transferred to Richmond State Hospital in 1911. The assembly Hall was unsafe, the Pathology building was completed & wings were added to the Rear Center building.
Records indicate there were 270 employees in the 1910s. The records also show: the great flood of 1913 caused limited damage to the hospital, Wasserman test developed & used at the hospital, hospital still overcrowded, water being pumped from the Wabash River instead of contaminated wells, fire damaged Ward 4, 25th anniversary of the hospital, eugenics study began.
World War 1 years were difficult for employees and employees. Treatment programs, medical care & everyday services were reduced as male attendants & officers went into military service.
The 1925 statistical reports indicate 1,196 patients present, 217 admissions, 87 discharges & 100 deaths. Additions included a new root cellar, southwest road & stone bridge. Additions to the 6th & 7th wards, radiators placed in attendants' rooms, new operating room in addtion to the 3rd ward.
Building construction in the late 1920s included: Men's infirmary & Officer's cottages in 1926 & the women's infirmary in 1928. Total acreage was 807 after the purchase of 2 farms. The first canteen was opened in 1928. Occupational Therapy for females, radios were installed throughout the hospital created L ward in the basement of the men's infirmary & created hydro & electro-therapy departments in 1929.
By an act of the State Legislature of Indiana in 1927, the name of the hospital was changed from Northern Indiana Hospital for the Insane to Logansport State Hospital. The decade ended with 1,389 patients and 166 employees.
The 1930s began with: overcrowding, ward building construction urgent repairs needed, dependence on farm & dairy for supplies & depressed economy. Dr. C.L. Williams began his superintendency in 1933 & completed it in 1945. Emphasis in the '30s was on rehabilitation of water lines; medical research; improving patient services; updating heating, plumbing, electrical & telephone systems; and starting a social work department. In the mid-1930s the Works Progress Administration (WPA) allocated federal funds for re-roofing, opening a quarry, reconstruction of the stone driveways & concrete work.
A women's treatment ward building, known as 14-15, later as inactive TB, then Gray 5 & 8 (Isaac Ray after 1979) was completed in 1932 for $189,000. A series of buildings was financed 55% state, 45% federal. These buildings in the late 1930's were: Men's treatment ward known as M-O & camp, later female treatment on M, Violet & Orange (adolescents and mentally retarded) opened at a cost of $250,000. The Camp ward barracks, housing working male patients since 1907, was razed soon after and the men moved into the lower floor of M-O. this building was located on the far west end of the original line of buildings on the ridge. M-s (medical-surgical) valued at $450,000, was located northeast of the Administration building and opened in 1939. M-S has housed new admissions, TB & geriatric patients, hospital wards, psychology, social service, doctor's offices, X-ray, EEG & EKG, dental, central supply, medical records, hydrotherapy & the morgue.
The same funding formula was used to construct 3 buildings, 2 as wards & 1 for personnel. Wards 16-17 (known as old person's ward, inactive TB then Gray 6-7) opened in 1940 as did wards R-S (later known as Admissions-Treatment). Those buildings were nearly identical in design & total cost for each was $225,000. Several services were reconstructed. Laboratory progressed from being a rodent-proof morgue in 1891 to a more well-equipped lab in 1939 in the new M-S building. Hydrotherapy was conducted in its own department rather then on the wards and photographing of patients began in 1934. The 50th Anniversary on July 1, 1938 observed 5 decades of services to the needs of mentally ill.
Dr. C.L. Williams was responsible for guiding the hospital through the depression and war years. His administration was marked by a total approach since he recognized that no one service was more important than another. A Department of Nursing was organized in 1940 with Miss Roth as director. The first consideration was the mental & physical care and comfort of the patient. Music & work therapy positions were new specialties to the psychiatric setting. Special programs for the alcoholic and sexual deviant were initiated. Several specialists in psycho-surgery were added to staff. Use of the farms was increased and put into full production.
In the early 1940s, personnel problems were created by the National Defense Program. In the all out war effort before & into the World War 2 years, the increase of wages and the creation of new positions in industry resulted in large numbers of employees leaving state employment. The hospital was not fully staffed for several years. War economy resulted in less maintenance & repair parts were not available.
In 1941 the Hilltop Herald, the hospital newspaper, began publication. A new canning plant was built in 1942. The nursing Service had 57 women attendants & 61 male attendants. The Assembly Hall built in 1893 was now 50 years old and despite having been condemned in 1918, was still in constant use. On February 10, 1943 400 patients from Evansville State Hospital arrived by train after a 5 day trip. They were held at Logansport due to a large fire at Evansville.
In the mid-1940's annual reports always included superintendents' recommendation for a new northern Indiana state hospital to lessen the overcrowding at Logansport. Beatty Memorial Hospital (Westville State Hospital) opened in 1952. One report states 2 physicians were on duty when the census was 2,229 patients. Occasionally for 2 to 7 wards, there were no night attendants. Selected female patients would watch over those wards when needed.
The 1940s ended with these recommendations: tuberculosis cases need to be segregated; improved fire protection; new building & refrigeration units were needed; 1919 boilers; Assembly Hall & all 1887 ward buildings should be replaced; and new employee cottages were needed.
John A. Larson, M.D. was superintendent as the 1950s began. The challenge was to turn the hospital from a custodial institution into a psychiatric center using an active treatment program. In revolutionizing policy, he reorganized wards into treatment centers. Screening, identifying type & stage of disease, surgical services, consulting services, hydrotherapy, trained volunteers assigned to wards to relieve staff for patient therapy, dental surveys and a nurses training center were innovative for his day.
Life magazine in 1951 alleged ""Longcliff's use of cuffs, muff, camisoles and straight jackets without authorization; confinement meant, for most patients, a life sentence until malnutrition, TB, abuse and neglect finished the inmate off."" Backed by the governor and an emergency grant of funds, the turnaround was indicated by 10 full-time physicians, consulting specialists, student nurse program, an 8-hour shift & 50% more attendants. In 1951 the hospital was awarded second place by the American Psychiatric Association for the progress made.
During the 1950s changes included Insulin therapy, enlarged alcoholic treatment program, increased use of ECT, new Red Cross volunteer program & a new ward for TB patients. The hospital also received funds for a 40-hour work week. The First annual carnival in 1952 was an employee-sponsored event for patients. Horse shows were enjoyed in the mid-1950s as were the annual flower shows & occupational therapy exhibits.
Construction projects in this decade were refrigeration & storage building in 1952, Rogers Hall and the 180' power plant chimney both in 1956. Contracts were approved for 4 additional cottages. The hospital reached its peak patient population in 1954 with 2,448 patients present, 100 were transferred that year to Beatty Memorial. WLCF, the hospital TV station, began limited televising in 1959.
Priorities into the 1960s included: chapel with recreational & occupational therapy; receiving building for acute, intensive treatment, medical services. One 1960 editorial read ""Logansport State Hospital for years has been recognized as Indiana's leading mental hospital, not because it has had the largest number of patients, but because it has had progressive leadership and a capable, dedicated staff."" The 1960s began with a census of 2,200 patients and ended the decade at less then 1,400.
The 1913 outdoor swimming pool was located in 1960 after 45 years under weeds and debris. The pool was reconstructed and continued to be used until the late 1980s. The Activity Therapy building opened in June 1963 and Ward Building 1-2 reconstruction was completed in 1965. Institutional workers had a salary range from $175 to $215 per month in 1963. Psychiatric attendants were paid $205 a month.
Admissions in 1962 were at 1,400 but dropped to 800 8 years later. The number of children however increased from 30 in 1962 to 86 in 1966 showing a need for a children's unit. Nearing the end of the 1960s two developments occurred. First, Superintendent Fogel was notified that the hospital's 920 acre farming operation was to be terminated by March 1968. The second development was the hospital's reorganization into the Unit System. By April 1968 all patients from the same county were assigned to the same unit or grouping of wards. The movement was away from the assignment by diagnosis or custody.
The 1970s began with administration stressing ""management by objectives."" Individual employees and supervisors planned, agreed upon and wrote the results to be accomplished by a given date. Patient census was to be reduced to 1,360 by 1973. Ten year (1973-1983) objectives guided the hospital, employees and patient care programs. The role of the hospital was changing with the coming of several comprehensive mental health centers. Logansport was no longer the center of the catchment area. Redistricting occurred later in the 1970s. A new laundry facility was completed in 1977 & Gray 5-8 was converted into a forensic unit in 1979. Beatty Memorial Hospital (Westville State Hospital) changed over to a prison in 1979, this resulted in the new forensic unit and an increase in admissions from northwest Indiana.
A new food service facility began to take shape in 1980 on site of the former men's infirmary & L ward. Centralized food preparation, 2 cafeterias & service to 9 satellite kitchens provided better conditions. On June 14, 1980, a fire destroyed the kitchen area that had been used for many years and was about to be closed. Throughout the 1980s several wards buildings were renamed & upgraded.
In 1994 Central State Hospital in Indianapolis was closed, this led to an increase of patients and funds being allocated for more upgrades. Demolition of older unused ward buildings started around 200 and continued after the new Isaac Ray Treatment Center opened. Today only a few of the older buildings, including the original Administration Building still stand.

Indiana,Madison State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Madison_State_Hospital,,1907,1910,Active,Cottage Plan,,Southeastern Indiana Hospital for the Insane | Southeast Regional Treatment Center,"On Feb. 21, 1905, the Indiana legislature passed a bill to construct a mental institution in southeastern Indiana. A commission named for the purpose chose Madison as the site of the institution. It was built mostly on land purchased from Henry and Ford Hitz at $100 per acre, atop the hills overlooking the Ohio River. The first patients were accepted at the new Southeastern Indiana Hospital for the Insane on Aug. 23, 1910. The approximately 600 patients were transported here from Central State Hospital in Indianapolis by train. Guards who stood watch over them carried shotguns loaded with rock salt.
There were 30 two-story buildings with 20 to 70 beds each to house the patients, with the buildings being placed in a symmetrical pattern with administration and service buildings in between. Men’s buildings were on one side of the grounds, women’s buildings on the other. Heretofore, mental patients had been “warehoused” in huge buildings. But the new, enlightened view of “moral treatment” current in the early 20th century was that disturbed minds could be restored to sanity in a beautiful, peaceful and accepting environment such as the new state hospital offered, with its breathtaking view of the Ohio River Valley. The breaking up of the patients’ housing into smaller buildings, known as the cottage plan, also was aimed at more humane treatment of the mentally ill and at trying to restore them to sanity.
The name of the new institution was changed to Madison State Hospital in 1927. But from its earliest days, the institution came to be known locally as “Cragmont,” a nickname that died out only in recent years. Brains of long-deceased patients, which were studied after the patients’ deaths as part of the research into the disease, are preserved at the museum. Other studies were done of criminal sexual psychopaths, and of the results of the abuse of drugs and alcohol. Involved in the various studies were such physicians as Dr. George Zirkle, Dr. Peter King and Dr. Ott B. McAtee, who was the superintendent for many years. Among the buildings that pre-date the establishment of the state hospital, the gatehouse is one of the very few that have survived. The stone portion in front dates to the 1840s; the rear part, to 1926.
Shortages of money became a problem in the 1930s during the Great Depression. The staff-to-patient ratio suffered a tremendous imbalance, with 110 attendants caring for 1,585 patients. As a result, some treatments, such as shock and hydro therapy, could not be given because of high costs. Many patients were staying at the hospital longer than necessary as a way of keeping it operating to meet state funding requirements. Administrative changes also had an impact on the facility. During the 1940s, the hospital saw five different superintendents. By the late 1950s, the patient population began to decline rapidly, partly due to new medications & treatments. Today, there are  approximately 100 patients, divided into 8 different units.

The maximum security division opened in 1954, replacing the old Hospital for Insane Criminals at the Indiana State Prison.  This division served the criminally insane from the entire state. At one point, the mental sanitarium housed as many as 1,750 patients spanning from age 6 to 80 and included both minimum and maximum security units. The property boasted a school, as well as prior amenities such as a bowling alley, beauty shop and solarium.
Beatty Hospital was converted in 1979 into the Westville Correctional Center.  Patients from the civil division were transferred to other mental health hospitals.

Indiana,Richmond State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Richmond_State_Hospital,,1884,1890,Active,Cottage Plan,,East Haven Asylum | Eastern Indiana State Hospital for the Insane,"The site for the Eastern Indiana Hospital for the Insane, now known as Richmond State Hospital, of approximately 307 acres, was purchased in 1878. Construction started in 1884 and was completed in 1890. While the Indiana legislature had authorized the establishment of a ""hospital for the insane"" as early as 1827, the doors of the Indiana Hospital for the Insane (later re-named Central State Hospital) did not open until 1848.
At Richmond, between 1887 and 1890, three of the completed buildings were occupied by ""The School for Feeble Minded Youth."" In 1890, these patients were transferred to what is now known as the Fort Wayne Developmental Center. The buildings were refurbished and the hospital formally opened on July 29, 1890, with the first patient admitted on August 4, 1890.
The hospital buildings were constructed on the cottage plan in order to prevent any ""disastrous conflagration,"" and provide for immediate evacuation of a small number of persons in case of fire. There are many interesting architectural details in the older buildings, including exterior cupolas, interior detailing such as intricate railings and stained glass.
Although the general layout followed the cottage plan, the main administration building with adjacent buildings extending like wings is very similar to the Kirkbride plan which was the model for many asylums constructed during this era. The Hospital has had a number of names through the years, including East Indiana Asylum for the Insane, East Indiana Hospital for the Insane and finally Richmond State Hospital. Although it was never an official name, it was long referred to as ""East Haven.""
In 1911, the Colony Act was passed and additional acreage was purchased to allow patients to work the farmlands. Richmond was selected to be the parent institution for this type of treatment. The five farms acquired were christened ""Wayne Farms."" The local arboretum furnished the names: Cedar, Maple, Pine, etc. Male patients with a agricultural background were placed in the colonies. Their productive efforts were realized in many ways, but specifically through ribbons and prizes received from the exhibits of cattle and farm products at the Wayne County Fair as well as the Indiana State Fair. On May 16, 1927, the hospital's name was changed from Eastern Indiana Hospital for the Insane to Richmond State Hospital.
Located on the grounds is the Klepfer All Faiths Chapel. Financed entirely by donations from the community, the chapel was named in honor of Dr. Jefferson Klepfer, M.D., who served as superintendent from 1953 to 1976.
To better serve the patients who require continued treatment the hospital has programs geared to the needs of individuals with persistent and severe mental disorders and the older person with mental illness. Richmond State Hospital provides services to patients from the Community Mental Health Centers in East Central and Northeast Indiana. Many patients come from larger urban settings, but many of the patients continue to be from small rural communities.
Two of the newer buildings that comprise Richmond State Hospital are the 192-bed Residential Treatment Center and the food Preparation Center. Both were completed in 1991. all of the hospital building are on a 120-acre campus that has been developed into a park-like setting with beautiful trees, shrubs, copious flower beds and a pond. After more than 100 years of providing mental health services, Richmond State Hospital continues the commitment to meet the needs of our changing population. The primary goal of the hospital continues to be to plan for and, in cooperation with other care providers, develop and deliver a comprehensive and integrated system of mental health services of superior quality.

The ""Indiana School for Feeble Minded Youth"" opened its doors on East State Boulevard three years later and admitted 300 children. The young people enrolled at the new school took classes in art, music and gym. As they grew older, girls were taught laundry and domestic skills while boys were taught farming, carpentry, brick-making, and cobblery.
By 1918, the facility's population swelled to well over 1,000 and included adults as well as children. Overcrowding and old facilities led to the 1954 decision to transplant the school to Parker Place Farm, one of four farms it owned and the site of the present campus. The state constructed 18 buildings on the 142-acre site to meet the needs of the residents. The move began in 1960 and, in fewer than 10 years, the school's population exploded to more than 2,500. Some residents continued to live at the old school for about 20 years. After a number of years in which the State Street campus was inhabited by vagrants and rats, the Administration Building was demolished in 1982 to make way for North Side Park, which became Bob Arnold Northside Park. The Park Department saved a stone archway to leave as memorial to the former residents.
The facility was renamed the Fort Wayne State Developmental Center eight years later, and, in 1986, it made history once more when it became the first facility for the developmentally disabled (public or private, large or small) in Indiana to be accredited by the Accreditation Council on Services for People with Developmental Disabilities (ACCD). Amid controversy over it's closing, the announcement was made official in June 2007. Ivy Tech Community College has taken over the property and will begin demolition this summer to make room for it's new North Campus buildings.

It was originally a work farm and residential facility, which housed developmentally disabled men over the age of sixteen. In 1925, the Colony's administrative authority was transferred to the School for Feeble minded Youth at Fort Wayne. For this reason the mortality lists for the Colony were included in the Annual Reports of the Fort Wayne State School to the Governor. The Colony became the Muscatatuck State School in 1941 and began to accept women as residents. A decision was made to close the Muscatatuck State Developmental Center by the beginning of 2005 and have its grounds used for Homeland Security training.The current Homeland security Facility is called the Muscatatuck urban training center and is used to train first responders in a variatey of Natural and Man made disasters.

State laws regarding eugenics was carried out at the facility almost immediately. New Castle was chosen mainly because of the price of the land at $100 an acre. By the end of the institution’s first year, a total of 84 men were admitted, with 61 percent from other institutions, mostly county poor asylums or jails, and 38 percent with no previous institutional experience. Two additional structures were completed in April 1908 and construction on the custodial building was finished in December 1908. These buildings increased the capacity of the Village to 116 men. Three additional cottages were completed in 1911, allowing for a total of 186 patients. Patients worked on the farm and grew much of the food for the Village, making it nearly self-sustaining at the beginning. The population grew from 82 male patients in 1908 to 337 males in 1917. In 1922 the colony started construction on buildings for women. Over the course of three years, twelve buildings were constructed to hold 220 female patients, bringing the total population to 701. It was about this time patient abuse became public.
With the 1930s the colony built a school so children patients were able to get an education. A new infirmary building was constructed in 1938 as part of the WPA project, it opened in 1940 and was able to house around one hundred patients. Also allegations of patient abuse were at the lowest in many years.
By 1950 it was the only colony left and changed it's name in 1955. Dr. Van Nuys retired in 1952, he had been running the facility since it's opening in 1907. In the early 1960s it changed it's housing to accept developmentally disabled. Focus shifted from long-term patient care to short-term rehabilitation and integration back into society. The facility no longer treated only epileptics; mentally handicapped patients became the focus. Farming operations ceased in 1969 and patient numbers dropped dramatically in the 1970s. Two sets of colony buildings closed in the 1980s. The buildings were demolished and the land turned over to the Department of Natural Resources. In 1985, the name changed again to the New Castle State Developmental Center. The population continued to shrink and quality of patient care was questioned by the state. The institution closed on August 15, 1998, with the remaining patients moved to other facilities. The land currently houses a correctional facility.
The State Archives has the master card index, two admission registers, a sample of the early medical records, and complete records for patients discharged from 1988-1998.

The funds for the hospital were secured by popular subscription from the citizens of New Albany and by city-wide fund raising efforts. Fund raising events included everything from neighborhood skits, as the one given at the Hackett residence at 1732 DePauw Avenue by the neighborhood children charging a 3-cent admission, to a more elaborate pageant produced at Glenwood Park in 1923. This pageant, The Greatest Gift: A Pageant of Health, was written for the benefit of the FCTA, had a cast of 1000 members, and was seen by thousands of people from New Albany, Jeffersonville and Louisville. Pathé News shot a movie of the pageant and it played at the Grand Theater the following Sunday. By 1936, fund raising efforts allowed a 20-bed sanatorium to open on the site. In July 1938, twelve years from the date of purchase of the land, the Indiana General Assembly held a special session to enact a bill locating a site for the Southern Indiana Tuberculosis Hospital.
The hospital was a Public Works Administration project and Indianapolis architect August Bohlen was chosen to draw up the plans. Construction began immediately, and by August 1940, the $1 million, 150-bed hospital received its first patients. A unique feature of the hospital was that it provided individual rooms for the patients instead of the more widely used ward facilities. Silvercrest included an outpatient clinic with numerous laboratories, surgery rooms, kitchen and laundry facilities, and a dental office on site. The original complex included the main building, a residence built for the superintendent, and several guest houses. The hospital served a 32-county area and when the facility opened, it was too busy
ministering to its 150 patients to take time out for a formal dedication. On May 10, 1941, state and local dignitaries, including Indiana Gov. Henry F. Schricker, gathered at the site for the long awaited dedication.
By December 1952, five motel-type structures, along with two large residences, were added and dedicated to the medical campus totaling $275,000.00. Hawkins and Walker, well known New Albany architects, drew up the plans, and Sheperd and Rogers, also of New Albany, were the contractors.
The State began to phase out operations at Silvercrest on April 1, 1972. The site was used as the Silvercrest Children’s Development Center until 2006. In 2013 the main building was re-opened as a senior living center,The Villages at Historic Silvercrest, after a $16 million renovation.",2006,"New Albany, IN",Art Moderne and Art Deco,,1940,2006,150,150,,0
Indiana,Indiana Girls School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Indiana_Girls_School,1869.0,,1907,Closed (as a juvenile facility),Cottage Plan,,Indianapolis Juvenile Correctional Facility,"In 1869, Indiana established the first detention facility in the country that was exclusively for females. Originally named the Indiana Reformatory Institution for Women and Girls, it was located just east of downtown (on Randolph St., between Michigan and New York) and housed both juvenile (ages 10 to 18) and adult offenders. In 1899 the two groups were separated since it was believed that the women were a bad influence on the girls, and in 1907 the girls were moved to a new set of buildings west of the city, on what is now Girls School Road. It was at that time that the name of the facility was changed to the Indiana Girl’s School.
Girls were committed via court order. The reasons for commitment included truancy, using bad language, incorrigibility, intoxication, immorality, and smoking cigarettes. Once there, the girls were assigned a course of training by a committee. The available training programs varied over the years and included such things as home management, needlecrafts, foods, clothing, waitress training, beauty culture, and nursing. Most girls stayed at the facility at least a year. Once they completed their program satisfactorily, they were released on probation, which lasted another year. Once that was completed they were typically allowed to return to their families.[1]
In 1914, one girl in the school lost her life to a Diphtheria epidemic which sickened forty-six other girls. The school first started a parole system in 1926. On September 10, 1964, the Indiana State Police were dispatched to the school in order to stop a riot that involved 200 girls. A Grand Jury started an investigation of the riot, and discovered that there were many factors that led to the incident, including homosexuality, drug usage, and a lack of respect for the school’s superintendent. The school also had 65 girls escape during this time. In 1985, some girls filed a lawsuit against the school alleging that the school had made them stay in their cells wearing nothing but socks and underwear, but this charge was later dropped.
In 1996, the facility was renamed The Indianapolis Juvenile Correctional Facility. Despite the name change, the facility functioned as an all-girls school until January 2006, when juvenile males were moved onto the same grounds from the former Indiana Boys’ School in Plainfield, Indiana (though they were later removed from the facility, making it all-female once again).
On July 7, 2009, it was announced by Department of Corrections Commissioner Buss that Indianapolis Juvenile Correctional Facility's population will move to a site near a state hospital in Madison, Indiana ending the 102 years as the Indiana Girls School. The Indiana Womans Prison, located Downtown Indianapolis, will move to the old Girls School to accommodate overcrowding. Some male inmates located near Plainfield Correctional Facility will move into the old Woman's Prison downtown. All the changes will be made by year's end.

Governor Conrad Baker selected the site in Plainfield, Indiana. The name changed in 1883 to the Indiana Reform School for Boys, and again in 1903 to the Indiana Boys’ School. Judges from any criminal or circuit court in Indiana could commit juvenile males charged with crimes, incorrigibility, or delinquency. The function of the school was to reform juvenile offenders through education and vocational training.
In the 1890s, the disciplinary system at IBS was semi-military in nature, which can be attributed to the tenure of Colonel Thomas Charleton as superintendent. “The disciplining here is much as it is at West Point or Annapolis, except in this—that, instead of placing under arrest as is done with the worst offenders there, we use some corporal punishment,” Col. Charleton is reported to have said.
Col. Charleton declared himself “a believer in industrial work” and during his tenure began training boys in nineteen different occupations: brick making, brick burning, brick laying, plastering, painting, glazing, gas and steam fitting, gas making, bread making, cooking, tailoring, shoe making, gardening and farming, caring for stock, floriculture, carpentry, laundry, printing, blacksmithing, and making music. In 1900, the badge system was adopted to set release dates for boys. New boys were given a “badge level” depending on the severity of their crime. The boys could earn badges for good behavior and hard work. Under the system, it was possible for a boy to leave the school in one year. In 1901, the institution’s name was changed to Indiana Boys' School, a name it would keep for more than a century. Col. Charleton retired after 20 years as superintendent of the school in that same year and was replaced by E. E. York, who continued the system Charleton had established.
IBS hosted movie crews in 1949 for the shooting of 'Johnny Holiday' starring William Bendix, Hoagy Carmichael and Allen Martin Jr. The movie, directed by Willis Goldbeck, is the story of a young tough street boy who is sent to a boys’ prison. The historic Administration Building, built in 1893, is featured in several scenes.
In 1970, the farm and dairy programs were closed and replaced by a vocational horticulture program. The following year, co-ed activities were added to the school agenda. Monthly activities with the Indiana Girls’ School located about 9 miles (14 km) to the east were incorporated and included a co-ed newspaper called “The Herald and Super-Star Spectrum.” Other co-ed activities were group counseling, school and staff development.
September 1971, the administration of IBS was reorganized to be more efficient. Part of those changes included the initiation of volunteer programs in cooperation with local churches. Some programs included were PACE (Program for All-inclusive Care of the Elderly), Rotarians, Optimists and Jaycees. In June 1973, corporal punishment was halted at IBS following the U.S. District Court trial of a lawsuit filed by two former IBS inmates. One inmate who appeared at the trial said he “was paddled until he bled” and another claims to have been held in solitary confinement for 70 days.
The Indianapolis Re-Entry Educational Facility (IREF) was opened as restricted minimum-security facility for adult male offenders on January 13, 2006. This Indiana Department of Correction (IDOC) facility was converted into the nation’s first correctional facility dedicated to re-entry after serving as the Indiana Boy’s School for over 100 years. IREF relocated to the city of Indianapolis on December 16, 2009 at the site of the former Indiana Women’s Prison.
Originally sent to the Gibault School for Boys, then to the Boys' Town in Indianapolis. Four days after his arrival there, he escaped with another boy. The pair committed two armed robberies on their way to the home of the other boy's uncle. He ended up at the Indiana Boys School at the age of 13, then escaped in 1951. He was later caught in California after attempting to steal a car.",,"Plainfield, IN",,,1867,2006,,,,0
Indiana,Marion National Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Marion_National_Sanatorium,1888.0,,1890,Active,Cottage Plan,,"National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Marion Branch | Veterans Administration Medical Center, Marion Campus | VA Northern Indiana Health Care System","On July 23, 1888, with increasing membership amongst the six National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (NHDVS), Congress established the seventh of ten National Homes in Grant County, Indiana to be known as the Marion Branch.  Congress allotted an appropriation of $200,000, while the Grant County residents provided a natural gas supply for the heating and lighting of this new facility.  Marion, Indiana was selected as a site for the new branch due to the availability of natural gas and the political activities of Colonel George W. Steele, Sr, the 11th Congressional representative from 1880 to 1890.
On March 2, 1889, an announcement was made that the selection of a site along Jonesboro Pike, 2 ½ miles southeast of town, was announced.  The site was assembled from 76.41 acres of Geiger owned farmland which was purchased on March 28, 1889, and 140.43 acres of land purchased from Isaac Elliott on April 10, 1889.  These two tracts were purchased for approximately $110 per acre.  The Federal Government only authorized up to $90 per acre, and therefore, local Grant County citizens donated the additional monies to ensure the construction of the Marion Branch.  The site was later enlarged with the purchase of three additional tracts in 1894, 1896, and 1897, for a total of 298.84 acres.
Work on the barracks was rushed by the contractor, William Saint, and the first building, a temporary one, was completed so that 35 disabled veterans were brought here to occupy it on November 23, 1889. The Marion Branch officially opened in 1890.  The first buildings constructed in 1889 – 1890 were six barracks and the original hospital.  The hospital was later enlarged with an annex and a southern wing. By 1898, six additional barracks, a headquarters building, dining hall and kitchen, Stinson Memorial Hall, and the Chapel were constructed.
A burial ground of 61.5 acres was set aside from the buildings in memory of the men who offered their lives in defense of their country.  “The Silent Circle” is designated as Section 1, which consists of seven concentric rows of graves.  Each grave has a plain marble marker with the name of the deceased, along with the rank and regiment.  Each marker is numbered in succession but does not indicate any order of death.  There is a section that was reserved for the burial of employees and their families to include the first governor of The Home and the first surgeon of the hospital.
To meet the urgent demand of a neuropsychiatric hospital to take care of the neurotic and psychotic ex-service men of World War I who resided in the seventh district, the Marion Branch was completely overhauled, revamped and converted into a modern neuropsychiatric hospital.  The old soldiers were transferred to other branches of the National Soldiers’ Home and the Marion Branch officially became the Marion National Sanatorium on January 1, 1921. Admission was for nervous and mental patients exclusively.
In 1923 a physical rehabilitation building, or gymnasium, was added to the facility. There was also a new neuropsychiatric-tuberculosis hospital, with a capacity of 80 beds opened that year. The Sanatorium continued farming operations. During this era the facility maintained 51 milk cows and 17 other cattle. Other facilities available at the Sanatorium were a laundry and dry cleaning plant. There were also the two chapels, one Protestant and one Catholic, with a Protestant and Catholic Chaplin and a paid choir and organist.
The Sanatorium also operated a store and restaurant, or “canteen.”  The store maintained a stock of candies, cigars, tobaccos, stationery, toilet articles, novelties, etc.  The restaurant served short orders from 7:15 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.  In the restaurant, there was a lounging club room for patients, where they could meet and entertain visitors.  This room was equipped with comfortable furniture, including a piano and also had a loud speaker connected with the master radio outfit. The master radio outfit was located in the basement of the theater. It was a 240 volt amplifier, capable of receiving programs, amplifying them and sending them out to all hospitals and cottages. There were loud speakers in each day room and headsets for bed patients.
On July 21, 1930, the Veterans Bureau, the Bureau of Pensions, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers were consolidated into the Veterans Administration, with the National Home being designated the “Home Service.”  On March 31, 1932, the Marion Branch, NHDVS was the first hospital converted to a VA hospital. On October 6, 2011 an Indiana State Historical Marker was placed commemorating the Marion Branch, National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. Today the Marion Administration Medical Center delivers health services viewed as a continuum consisting of maintenance of health, prevention and diagnosis of disease, treatment and rehabilitation. The staff at the hospital, volunteers from many state service organizations in Marion and surrounding communities provide assistance in numerous and various ways. The volunteer organization provides more than one thousand three hundred scheduled activities, with twenty-two thousand members participating throughout the year.
This facility is now a part of VA Northern Indiana Health Care System, a dual campus facility associated with the former VA Medical Center Fort Wayne. Unfortunately, the original treatment hospital built in 1889, the greenhouse and cadet quarters are scheduled for demolition.

Indiana,Neuronhurst,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Neuronhurst,,,1888,Demolished,Single Building,,Dr. Fletcher’s Sanatorium,"Fletcher’s Sanatorium, known as Neuronhurst after 1904, was one of Indianapolis’s first private hospitals for the treatment of nervous and mental diseases in Indiana. Dr. William B. Fletcher, a son of Indianapolis pioneer Calvin Fletcher, opened his private hospital in 1888 on Pennsylvania Street and eventually moved to Alabama Street in a house on the current site of the old Indianapolis City Hall (most recently used as the interim library). Fletcher worked closely with Dr. Mary A. Spink, who eventually became his business partner.
In about 1903 Neuronhurst, presumably named after neurons which are the basic building blocks of the nervous system, expanded on the eastside site. Dr. Spink’s brother, Edgar G. Spink, moved to Indianapolis to serve as construction manager for a new hospital. Spink would remain in the city and become known as a developer and manager of many hotels and apartment buildings such as The Lodge and the Spink-Arms Hotel. Through the years, the older house on the corner would house Edgar Spink, W. B. Fletcher and his family, and various hospital staff and nurses.
The new, three-story and basement brick hospital could house up to 50 voluntary and committed patients. Census records show that there was a very high nurse-to-patient ratio and advertisements promised close personal supervision with minimal restraint. Like many modern hospitals of the era, Neuronhurst provided pleasant surroundings with gardens, a solarium, balconies, and screened-in sleeping porches for fresh air and sunshine. Treatment included a careful diet and plenty of exercise in the gymnasium and swimming pool. Later ads and articles indicate that the sanatorium also specialized in overcoming alcohol addiction. Many people attended the institution to get relief from business and daily stresses and enjoyed the therapeutic baths (saline, Turkish, steam, light ray, and ozone) and massages. Neuronhurst was nationally known and ads in the New York Times indicate that rates varied from $50 to 65 per month.
After working together for nearly twenty years, Dr. Mary Spink took over as president after Dr. Fletcher’s death in 1907. Spink pioneered the way for Indiana women who wished to practice medicine. She was assisted at the sanatorium by her sister, Dr. Urbana Spink, who was also a neuro-psychiatrist. Their aging mother, Rosanna Morgan Spink, helped manage the nurses and lived at 126 N. Highland Avenue. Both sisters lived at the institute, but traveled extensively overseas and to a cottage in Florida. Mary was an active suffragist and active with many medical associations.
The sanatorium suffered from a loss of patients during the Depression and after Spink’s death in 1939 the hospital closed. In the 1940s the buildings were used by the Medical Health Center Hospital, operated by the Indianapolis Public Health Department. The structures were demolished in the 1950s.

Indiana,Norways Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norways_Hospital,,,1898,Demolished,Single Building,,Dr. Sterne’s Sanatorium,"Neurologist Dr. Albert E. Sterne purchased Clifford Place and opened Norways, a private sanatorium, in 1898. It was a hospital for people with nervous and mental disorders at a time when mental illness was starting to be understood as a disease. The facility attracted customers from across the country and, at an average price of $50 per week by 1918, this was an expensive stay. Advertising mentions that the sanatorium was for people who were “used to luxury.” Attendants treated all forms of “constitutional maladies,” (including rheumatism, diabetes, stomach and kidney troubles, paralysis, and drug addictions) particularly those cured by the use of electricity, baths, massage, diet, and rest. Norways was the first mental institution in the state to employ insulin, metrazol, and electric shock therapy. After Sterne’s death in 1931, Dr. Larue Carter served as the hospital’s chief consultant.
Early advertisements promoted the hospital’s ideal location next to the fountains, flowers, and trees in Woodruff Place and a short walk to Pogue’s Run Parkway (now Spades Park) and Brookside Park. The large tract of natural forest trees in Technical Institute Park protected Norways from the dust and odor of the city. This postcard, made before 1907, shows the beautifully landscaped grounds on the four-acre facility. Although first named Sterne’s Sanatorium, Dr. Sterne changed the name to Norways due to his love for the many large Norway maple trees on the property. Literature stresses that “at no time are undesirable patients allowed to mingle with those upon whom the slightest deleterious influence might be exerted through contact.” Mild mental patients were housed in separate structures. Norways was on the northeast corner of East Tenth and Sterling Streets.
A plan drawn by architect Edward D. Pierre indicates that Norways considered expanding in 1949, but the improvements were never made. Norways operated until 1957 when Kroger razed the old house and other structures to build a supermarket in 1958. By the 1970s the store was nicknamed the “Fellini Kroger” (after the Italian movie director) due to the colorful cast of customers similar to the eccentric characters in his movies. After a long run, Kroger closed in the spring of 2007 and leases the building to Teacher’s Treasures, a nonprofit group that provides free school supplies to teachers.

Indiana,Oaklawn Psychiatric Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oaklawn_Psychiatric_Center,1962.0,,1963,Active,Single Building,,Oaklawn Community Mental Health Center,"Although services were provided from a temporary location in Elkhart beginning in July, 1962, Oaklawn’s doors formally opened on February 11, 1963. This brought to reality a vision which had begun nine years earlier when representatives of the Mennonite Central Committee constituency in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan met and agreed on the “need for more Christian and professional care in the field of mental health.” Oaklawn is one of eight Mennonite mental health centers.
Throughout Oaklawn’s history, the organization has been guided by this emphasis on quality care and treatment of the whole person—promoting wellness of mind, body, and spirit. Oaklawn’s vision “to help people live in harmony with self, others, and God, through healing and growth of the whole person” expresses this commitment.
Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren in Christ were represented on Oaklawn’s first board of directors appointed in 1958. The board expanded in 1959 to include community representatives, and again in 1961 to include a member from the Church of the Brethren. Robert Hartzler, first chairperson of the board, became the first administrator in 1961. Otto D. Klassen, M.D., joined the organization in July 1962 as medical director.
Initially Oaklawn’s programs were two-pronged: outpatient services and day treatment. Oaklawn focused on services for those who could return home in the evenings and on weekends. From this grew the community home program—often involving church families—in which area residents opened their homes to clients who lived too far away or who needed a different home environment for their treatment.
In the late 1960s, Oaklawn took a major step in serving the community by applying for federal funds under the Community Mental Health Centers Act. In 1973, Oaklawn Community Mental Health Center was incorporated and began receiving funds to provide mental health care on an ability-to-pay basis for persons who live in Elkhart County.
Another major step for Oaklawn began in 1983 when strategic planning led to establishing a psychiatric hospital. An assessment of area services revealed a need for more inpatient beds for psychiatric care. Oaklawn Hospital opened in July 1987 as a 78-bed inpatient facility for adults, adolescents, and children, helping to meet that need. This facility, located at 330 Lakeview Drive, Goshen, also houses Oaklawn's corporate offices. Over the years, Oaklawn has changed and adapted its mix of services to meet the needs of the community and of payers. Consequently, many inpatient beds have been converted to residential beds for adolescents and children. Oaklawn now offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric and addictions services for children, adolescents, adults and seniors.",,"Goshen, IN",,,1963,,78,,,0

The hospital severed the black community of Gary until it's closure in 1950 and was one of the first institutions in the area to provide segregated services with an all black nursing and medical staff.  The hospital's attendance declined in the 1930's when Gary's Methodist and Mercy Hospitals desegregated and began to see black patients.  Currently the site of the hospital is in serious deterioration and no plans, as yet, have been established to reuse the site.  it has stood vacant since it's closure in the 1950's.

Houck,Adams County Infirmary | Golden Meadows Home,"The Golden Meadows Home is an integral part of the history of Adams County. It was established in 1875 as an alternative home for Adams County citizens who were in need of housing and some structure in their lives. For many years, the facility included a farming operation to provide a working environment for those residents who could perform the farming tasks. While they no longer operate the farm, many of the residents do work in the community or assist in many ways around the facility. The current building was constructed in 1942-43 to replace the older structure that had been destroyed by fire. It is currently owned by the Adams County Infirmary.[1]

Indiana,Allen County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Allen_County_Infirmary,1853.0,,1865/1953,DemolishedActive (Current Facility),Single Building,A.M. Strauss (Original Building),Allen County Poor Farm | Byron Health Center | Allen County Health Center | Allen County Home for the Destitute,"The Allen County ""Poor Farm,"" as it was originally called, was established in 1853 and was first located in the wilderness of section 29 of Wayne Township (in the area of present-day Elmhurst High School, north of Lower Huntington Road). In that year George L. Parker was employed to keep the paupers at the Poor Farm for an annual sum of $600, and John A. Robinson was retained to build a house for the inmates for $750. These facilities were enlarged in 1854 and again, extensively, in 1860, during the directorship of James M. Read. In these years the director was required to furnish a team of horses, a wagon and harness, four cows and such farming equipment as would be necessary. The county, in exchange, paid Read $800 and furnished clothing and provisions for the inmates.
In 1864, at the height of the Civil War, the entire facility was moved closer to Fort Wayne. An infirmary was built as the centerpiece to the new farm, in the area just west of the present-day Bluffton Road Bridge, in what today is known as the Indian Village neighborhood and the Quimby Village Shopping Center. The new infirmary building was completed in June 1865, for $14,468, and James Read, the former overseer of the Poor Farm, was named Superintendent of the Allen County Asylum, as it was now called.
Expansion of the infirmary space was again required in 1871, and under Superintendent John Spice provisions were made to offer care ""for the convenience and better management of the different classes of inmates"" (History of Allen County, 1880, p.54). This is the facility that, in 1902, William Johnston came to superintendent. Today, in Allen County, the descendant of the old county Poor Farm and Asylum is the Irene Byron Health Center. Behind the Main Building and connected to it with a covered porch was the Insane Ward. North of the Main Building was the Power House and Laundry. South of the Main Building was the Bakery and farther south were the horse and cattle barns, the horse barn being nearest the road. [1]
Although a showplace through the 1930s, the facility came on hard times until 1954 when the Allen County Home, as it was called then, was placed under the direction of a new superintendent, Orville Miller, who lived at the facility with his wife, Sylvia and four daughters. Miller took a vital role in updating the facility and inviting the community to help do so. Miller served until his death in 1965. The facility became licensed as a nursing home in 1966. Tom Kastanis was appointed superintendent in 1965 and the facility’s name was changed to the Allen County Health Center. It was that year that the facility became self-sustaining. This was primarily due to the implementation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
In 1974, the Allen County Health Center merged with the Irene Byron Hospital forming Byron Health Center with a bed capacity at that time of 500. The tuberculosis unit was then closed the following year resulting in a 466-bed intermediate care facility. In 1995, the Allen County Commissioners signed an agreement with Recovery Health Services to operate the facility and Byron Health Center became the first county facility of its type to ever morph from being governmental in nature to being run as a private, not-for-profit entity in the state of Indiana.

Indiana,Brown County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brown_County_Poor_Farm,,,1896,Preserved,Single Building,,Brown County Asylum,"The first record of a pauper claim in Brown County was made in 1837 by Ambrose Cobb who was allowed $6.97 for caring for a poor person for four months.  Afterwards claims were allowed from the Overseer of the Poor, under whose direction the townships were to care for their poor. One pauper, Jane Sconce, was cared for by the county for more than 20 years. She was regularly farmed-out annually to the lowest bidder.  From 1847 to 1880 pauper claims averaged about $550 per year.
In 1859 the County Board took steps to purchase a poor farm, but after viewing several locations and found that the final cost was more than they cared to pay the project was abandoned. Then in 1869 the County Board purchased 244 acres of land adjoining Nashville on the east side from Thomas M. Adams. The cost was $5000 which was paid in two equal installments. William Waltman was contracted to construct a frame poor house to sit on their land to be 30 x 60 feet in dimension for $1474. It was a two-story frame house with a basement. It was completed in 1870 at a final cost of $1600.
The first Superintendant of the Poor Farm was John Taggart. He received the use of the farm and $3085 for caring for the poor for a period of three years. In 1872 Caleb Ferguson became Superintendent and he was paid $675 per year plus the use of the farm. He was succeeded in 1877 by Benjamin R. Kelley for $277.50 per year plus the use of the farm. Thomas J. Taggart became Superintendent in 1879 and then Ambrose Fraker in 1883. The number of poor farm residents ranged from eight to fifteen people.
In 1896 when Clark Campbell resigned as Superintendant there were twenty-three acres of corn, a patch of potatoes, hay in the barn, and a large garden with turnips, cabbage, and beans growing. The County Board of Commissioners financed other groceries and necessities from stores in Nashville, as well as repairs on the buildings and farm equipment maintenance. Brown County residents regularly gave food, supplies, and helped out on the farm when the residents could not. The county home remained useful for 93 years. With the resident population declining after the advent of Welfare and the Social Security system the County Commissioners decided to close the home on April 1, 1963. On Sept. 7, 1965 the Brown County School Corporation bought the old Poor House with 15 1/2 acres. It is used this day as their Administration building. The house is now listed with the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana.

Indiana,Carroll County Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Carroll_County_Home,1848.0,,1853/1910,Active,Single Building,Carl J. Horn,Carroll County Poor Asylum | Carroll Manor,"The Carroll County commissioners first purchased a farm to serve as the county poor asylum in 1848. The following year the “poor house” on the farm was destroyed by fire, and the
commissioners replaced it with a log building. In 1853, they constructed an 8-room brick building, presumably to house paupers residing at the farm. When Alexander Johnson,
Secretary of the Board of State Charities, visited the asylum in 1889 and 1890, he reported that the superintendent was living in the brick building, and approximately 30 residents were housed in four, one-story frame cottages “in very poor condition and entirely unsuited to their present use.” Johnson pronounced the Carroll County asylum the worst north of the National Road (later US 40). The farm at that point consisted of 160 acres of what Johnson considered unsatisfactory land, with its fertility exhausted. He stated in his report to the Board of Charities that the county commissioners had decided to construct new buildings. Apparently no action was taken, because an 1899 report by the Carroll County Board of County Charities and Corrections on the county asylum stated that the same brick building was in poor condition and was heated by stoves, making it a potential “death-trap.” The county board recommended a new, well-ventilated building.
Finally, in 1910, after the Delphi Journal published a scathing report on the sub-human conditions it found at the asylum, the county commissioners took action to building a new,
modern building on the south side of the 160-acre farm. They hired architect Carl J. Horn to prepare plans and specifications and advertised for bids in June, 1910. Construction was completed in 1911, at a cost of $40,000. A barn was constructed northwest of the new infirmary building in 1911. The commissioners adopted the name Carroll County Infirmary to denote a more positive mission of the new building in providing care for the poor.
In 1919, a report from the Board of State Charities after a visit to the infirmary found that the main building had electric lights, steam heat, and ventilation from window and through doors. The indoor bathrooms had porcelain toilets, and there was a bathtub in each resident wing, on both floors. There were 18 men and 4 women residents. One man and one woman were mentally ill. The report noted the existence of a one-story brick custodial building for the mentally ill, but this may be a reference to the kitchen and cell wing constructed adjacent to the main building. The food was found good and sufficient and was prepared by the matron, who may have been the superintendent’s wife.
A visit by the Carroll Board of County Charities the next year resulted in a report that found the buildings “modern, clean, and sanitary.” The laundry had been remodeled, and an electric washing machine installed. There were fifteen residents—twelve men and three women, with two of the total mentally ill and one epileptic. In 1922, a representative of the Board of State Charities visited again and noted that the sick were cared for in their own rooms or in isolation wards if necessary. There were fire extinguishers, but no fire escapes, which were recommended. The superintendent, Abe L. Downing, had two staff persons to operate the infirmary and the farm, a man and a woman.
After World War II, farming was gradually phased out, and since about 2000, most of the 160 acres comprising the farm has been sold. The 1911 barn has been dismantled and the timbers removed to another location. All other agricultural buildings have been razed except for the extant garage at the rear. In 2016, Carroll Manor, a name adopted by the late 1970s, continues in operation with a very similar mission to that of 1910-- providing a residence for indigent citizens of Carroll County who lack the means to live independently elsewhere.

Pattison,Dearborn County Asylum for the Poor | Youth Encouragement Services,"The Dearborn County Asylum for the Poor is the third such building in the county. The first county home was built in 1833 on a site in the northwest portion of the county. By 1853, the facility was outdated and over-crowded so it was sold and the current site was purchased. A second home was built in that year. The current building was constructed in 1882 and designed by Alex B. Pattison on 350 acres west of the community of Manchester. The cross plan building is 2 ½ stories and red brick with white trim. An enclosed cupola rises above the roof at the center of the building and houses the original bell. There were originally eight chimneys but only one remains. In total there are 64 rooms that included 38 resident rooms, the superintendent’s residence, kitchen and dining rooms, common rooms, and utilitarian rooms for the running of the facility. Two large meeting rooms are found on the second floor that could be used for a chapel.
At the time of its construction, the Dearborn County Asylum was one of the best facilities in the state. It eventually became almost entirely self-supporting financially. There was originally a large barn on the property for the sheep, dairy and beef cattle, hogs, and horses on the farm. A small grist mill was also used to grind feed for the stock. A small brick building is located a short distance from the main building. It was used to house the few “violently insane” residents.
As time went on, the number of residents dwindled and many of the able-bodied residents left, leaving only the elderly/infirm. Efforts to farm were diminished and much of the acreage was rented to local farmers. Eventually a portion of the land was sold and the majority of the land was allowed to return to forest. 
The Dearborn County Asylum for the Poor closed in 1980 and the following year Youth Encouragement Services, a foster home facility, moved in.",1980,"Aurora, IN",,,1882,1980,,,,0
Indiana,Decatur County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Decatur_County_Poor_Farm,1853.0,,1865,Demolished,Single Building,,Wabash County Home,"On Aug. 9, 1853, the county commissioners purchased 240 acres in Clinton Township, just south of Sandusky for $3,000. Five years later, they made the decision to sell 80 acres of the farm for $1600. When the American Civil War ended in 1865, the first building was erected for living accommodations. Residents actually made the bricks onsite and used them for the construction project. As time went on and the farm expanded, several other buildings (that still stand today) were built, including a large barn, milk house, and jail. These facilities provided the residents with the ability to live and work in a sustainable way, in order that the farm could continue to run efficiently. The planners also capitalized on the farm’s location, selecting an area in close proximity to the Rushville-Greensburg Railroad that passed through Sandusky.
The living quarters housed around forty people on average, until the creation of the Social Security Administration in the 1940s. The women and farm superintendent were housed in a two-story building that also held the dining room and kitchen. The men were kept in another two-story building very near the women’s home and to the west. Reports throughout history have claimed the facilities to be well kept and clean, yet no extravagant amenities were possessed. The buildings were lit and heated by the natural gas well that still functions today. When it came to the ventilation system, doors and windows were used to keep air moving.
A jail was located onsite, but was hardly ever used according to records and was only utilized for troublesome individuals. The milk house, which still stands today, is located between the residential halls and the jail and served strictly as a location for storing the milk from the cows and produce from the garden and orchard. The milk house has a slated roof and was just recently refurbished. A large two story barn was carved into the side of a hill, south of the living quarters and jail. The barn housed numerous kinds of livestock including cattle, horses, pigs and a few chickens. On the east side of the home and across the railroad, a plot of ground was marked as a cemetery, though no further records have been identified today.
The County Poor Farm moved to Greensburg, Washington Township, in 1949. The county purchased 37 acres south of the Decatur County Fairgrounds for $12,000. A new building was constructed here for a cost of $61, 944 and was used for the same purposes as the previous home. Luke Gookins and his wife were the superintendents for the last ten years at the Poor Farm, and they helped make the transition into Washington Township. The Poor Farm in Clinton Township was sold at this time for $28,400 to a man by the name of Debusk. An auction was held to sell personal property and equipment totaling $6500. DeBusk kept the Clinton Township Poor Farm for one year, then sold the property to Russell Foster. The Foster’s lived in the Poor Farm residence hall for approximately a year, and at that time the family proceeded to tear the building down. The building was taken down with tractors and ropes and was buried in the basement of the residence. Upon deconstruction, a small house located just east of the residence hall was built using many remnants of the County Farm building. This house still stands on the property today. Unfortunately, several years after the construction of the “New” Poor Farm in Washington Township, the building caught fire and all records were lost; however, the residents remained safe. It is said at the time of the fire, the building was leased as a nursing home. Eventually, the building closed down in 1964.",1964,"Sandusky, IN",,,1865,1964,,,40,0

Indiana,DuBois County Poor Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=DuBois_County_Poor_Asylum,1861.0,,1898 (Second location),Demolished,Single Building,,,"According to George Wilson's ""History of Dubois County from its primitive days to 1910,""
""A poor farm was purchased in 1861. It was near the geographical 
center of the county. An asylum was erected on the farm, but it was 
destroyed by fire on a Sunday afternoon in the autumn of 1881.
The present asylum is situated on a splendid farm one-and-one-half 
miles south of Ireland, in Madison township. The building in the extreme 
measures ninety feet by one hundred twenty-nine. The structure is of 
brick, which were made upon the farm. The roof is of slate. The rooms- 
are all in hardwood finish. The building itself is trimmed with Bedford 
stone, and to the traveler upon the road a half mile away, it presents a 
pleasing, comfortable, and respectable picture, with a grove of original 
growth in the background.
The building is two stories high, with a large and commodious basement. 
The rooms of the superintendent are in the front center wing of the asylum ; 
the women's department is in the north wing, the men's in the south. The 
cooking department is in the west wing. The structure faces the east. 
Each sex has its own accommodations, stair-ways, and other necessary 
annexes.
The building is heated by steam. The ceiling throughout the building 
is of steel, thus reducing the probabilites of a disastrous fire to a minimum. 
The water for the entire building is pumped by means of a gasoline engine 
into a tank, which is placed in the garret. A spring is one hundred fifty
feet north of the building. It is one of the finest in the entire county, and 
certainly in the western part. A stream of water that requires an eight 
inch pipe to carry it away flows constantly from the spring.
The building was erected in 189S, at a cost of $14,000. Hochgesang, 
Schmidt & Schuble were the contractors. The plan was drawn by M. 
F. Durlauf. The building has been extensively copied by other counties 
in Indiana. During the construction of the building, A. H. Koerner was 
county auditor, Joseph Fritz, Joseph Schroeder, and Conrad Jackie were 
the county commissioners.
This building is a credit to the county, and to August H. Koerner' s 
administration.""[1]

Indiana,Elkhart County Poor Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Elkhart_County_Poor_Asylum,,,1845/1886,Demolished,Single Building,,Elkhart County Home,"The first county home opened north of Goshen in 1845. In 1886, the Elkhart County Home moved locations and opened a new facility. The new County Home was a 113-room facility that also held a hospital, beauty shop and recreation area. The Elkhart County Home also had a farm adjacent to the main building. Farm work was done by residents. Earnings from the produce and livestock sold at the farm were used to offset the costs of the home’s operations. The sales from the farm in 1930 included 15 tons of alfalfa, 229 bushels of wheat, and over 1,500 quarts of canned fruits and vegetables. This made the farm self-sufficient and saved nearly $800 in the county’s operating budget. With the country in the grip of the Great Depression, the number of residents reached 116, the highest in the home’s history. Despite these challenges, the County Home was recognized as one of the best run facilities of its kind in the state.
By the mid-1900s the county home was on the decline. The growth of private care facilities and the lack of experience amongst the staff of the county home led to a steady decline in the number of residents. After analyzing the stability of the County Home, county officials made the decision to close the facility in 1965. The closing began in 1967, with the farmland being turned into Ox Bow County Park. The home remained open while a group led by County Councilwoman Marjory Madlem fought against its closure. The group, named Home Sweet Home, presented a petition to the county officials that the home remain open and improvements be made. County officials continued to move on with the closure despite the petition and, over the next decade, Madlem and Home Sweet Home continued the campaign through a series of lawsuits, protests, and a referendum. The referendum was voted down, lawsuits favored county officials, protests produced no action. By November of 1977, the last residents of the Elkhart County Home were transferred to assisted living facilities and the home officially closed.

In 1834, the legislature modified the law when ""an act to authorize an Asylum for the poor of the counties of Franklin, Fayette and Union"" was passed. The three-county commissioners agreed to establish a poor farm on 208 acres in Jackson Township in Fayette County. ""A small brick building was erected at a cost of $500, and in the spring of 1835, the property was occupied by the regular inmates.""
The joint asylum was abandoned in 1856 when Franklin County purchased a farm owned by Thomas H. Stringer near Brookville and ""erected suitable buildings for the establishment of an asylum. Since that time, some important additions and other necessary improvements have been made, which make the property extremely well ordered and pleasant.""

Earle Otis,Floyd County North Annex/Youth Center,"Few early records can be found that detail the beginnings of the community “poor house.” But almost since its inception, the county, through its residents, had set aside money to be used to help the indigent. According to Rich Green, a researcher that studied the building for a local company and released his findings in the “Review of Literature and Historical Documentation of the Floyd County Infirmary, New Albany, Indiana,” the farm began in 1838 as a lone log cabin. In 1875, a bigger structure was constructed with additions added in 1878. Fire caused by an ignited flue during a storm destroyed a significant portion of the complex in 1916, with the current standing building being built shortly thereafter.
Called many names through the ages, including the County Poor Asylum and the Floyd County Home for Aged, the building has housed some interesting New Albany citizens. Former slave turned Union Army nurse Lucy Higgs Nichols died there in 1915. While Nichols would be interred in West Haven Cemetery, the grounds around the home have served as a burial ground for many of these poor inhabitants. Green found evidence based on ground contour that at least two separate graveyards may have existed specifically for the institution, including that of the marked Potter’s Field.
Despite a 2008 vote by the county to tear it down and construct a new youth shelter in its place, no definitive plans have been made on the Poor Farm’s fate. In 2012, the shelter was moved to a different facility and, ironically, a poor economy has delayed the razing of the decrepit historic building.

The method of ""farming out"" the poor was to sell at auction or otherwise their care to the lowest responsible bidder. Sometimes the indigent fell into cruel hands and were half starved and otherwise misused. In the years 1836-37, the County Board paid $158.99 for the care of the poor.
In March, 1846, a different contract was made with Mr. Barker. He agreed to provide all necessaries for the county paupers, old and young, and keep them at his ""Asylum"" at Scotland, for $1 each per week. He gave bond of $500 for the faithful performance of the trust. For the fiscal year ending June, 1845, the poor cost $257.80, and for the year
ending June, 1848, poor and poor farm $933.54. By March, 1850, the board bought twenty-five acres of John Bradford for $250, to be used as an addition to the poor farm. At this time, Nancy Hatfield became Superintendent of the Poor, and continued as such for several years, or until 1857, when she was succeeded by Samuel Williams. Mrs. Hatfield was paid $1.25 per week for each pauper.
In 1858, G. W. Osborn contracted to build on the new farm a frame poor house, 18X40 feet, ten feet high, to be finished by December, 1858, for $900 in county orders. This contract was faithfully executed. In March, 1859, George Steele became Superintendent, for $575 per year. There were nine inmates of the asylum at this time. The poor cost the county $913.08 in 1857-58. The new brick poor house was erected by M. K. Tatout, in 1877-78, for $5,840, contract price, and a few hundred dollars extras.

The farm originally was about 160 acres and included land east of Cumberland Road where the county corrections complex is now located. The three-story brick “home” was built in the post-Civil War years and was well populated for many years. Even orphans with nowhere to go were taken in. It was local government’s way of answering a social need. Residents did farm work like most of the county’s population did at the time.
Following World War II there was probably an increasing stigma attached to being a county home resident and those who lived there were growing too old for farm work. So the farming operation was abandoned. Then in the 1960s with the advent of Medicaid it became obvious the era of the county home was ending. By the 1970s the century old home with architecture akin to Gothic looked dreary and forbidding. But, Director Basil Conrad and his wife did their best to maintain clean and comfortable living conditions for the dwindling number of residents. Finally, about 1980 the place was closed and the last 25 or 30 old folks were moved out, mostly to nursing homes.

The Henry County Poor Farm comprises 290 acres, located northwest of New Castle, the buildings being about one mile distance from the Court House. The land consist of first and second bottoms, and a portion is very much broken. Of the whole farm only 103 acres are under cultivation, the remaining (110 acres of which is woodland) being devoted to pasture. A field or two of tillable land bordering the creek, are subject to overflow, and for that reason, although possessing a fertile soil, do not always produce a good crop. The greater part of the tillable land is in fine condition, being either naturally or artificially well drained; the fences, as far as we could see, are in good order, the gates on their hinges, and a general air of neatness and system prevailed everywhere.
The buildings on the farm consist of a large two story slate roofed, brick dwelling house, smokehouse, woodshed, milk house, and a large barn. The dwelling has twenty-two rooms, four large halls, and a pantry. The family of the Superintendent occupies six rooms for their exclusive use, one room is devoted to storage purposes, and the remainder of the building is taken up with the kitchen, dining room, and bedrooms of the Poor House proper. The bedrooms are all large, about thirteen by fourteen feet, with high ceilings, and with ample facilities for through ventilation. There are accommodations for sixty inmates.
In March 1869, when Mr. Harvey entered upon his duties as superintendent, there were forty-two inmates in the infirmary. The number has rarely ever gone below that figure, and has on several occasions considerably exceeded it. There are forty-eight inmates at this time. The average for the eight years is about forty-five. This includes only permanent or resident paupers. In December last, the county board forbade the superintendent from boarding and lodging tramps. Previous to that date, these 'knights of the road' had been a heave and constant drain upon the resources of the farm. As an illustration of the extent of this burden, we note that the records of the Poor House show the feeding and lodging of 230 tramps in the months of January, February, and March 1875.
March 8, 1839: The commissioners purchased the farm of William Silver for $2,000.00.
May 1839: A log house was built.
January 4, 1844: A new brick building was erected.
May 9, 1855: The brick building was destroyed by fire. All records were destroyed.
1855: The commissioners ordered a new and larger building constructed, which is today the present building, at a cost of $7,000.00.
1855 - 1859: While the building was under construction all paupers were kept at the farm of superintendent Mark Modlin.
March, 1860: The new brick building was completed and all inmates returned to there new home.
1900: By the turn of the century the farm had grown to about 300 acres with the purchase of the bottom land.
The most recent use for the facility was the Henry County Youth Center. The center closed in 1988 and the building has remained unused for several years. [1]

Indiana,Indianapolis Orphan Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Indianapolis_Orphan_Asylum,,,1869,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The Indianapolis Asylum for Friendless Colored Children was founded in 1869 by a group of Indianapolis Orthodox Friends (or Quakers) who recognized the need for an institution to care for the dependent children of destitute ex-slaves who had moved to Indianapolis after the Civil War. The black population of the city, which before the war numbered only 500, had reached almost 3,000 by 1870, overburdening the city's charitable institutions which were reluctant to provide care for them in any case. The Quakers were already involved in running a white orphanage and, after being forced to turn away a number of black children, decided to open an institution specifically for them. The orphanage was established at 317 West 21st Street with donations from the Western Yearly Meeting, several Quaker philanthropists, and with a guarantee of support from the Marion County government.
Within a short time, the orphanage was accepting children from the entire state, as welfare officials in other counties found it more convenient to send their dependent black children to Indianapolis than to care for them at home. The orphanage accepted children from infancy to age fourteen. It had housed 18 dependents at the end of its first year and would care for over 3,000 in the course of its history up to 1922.
The Quakers ran the orphanage through a Board of Women Managers, whose president also served as director of the Asylum. The Board generally met once a month to decide on purchases and improvements for the institution. In addition to the Board of Women Managers, a Board of Directors, made up of male Quakers, oversaw the financial affairs of the orphanage. Although the institution was privately operated, most of its funds came from quarterly payments from Marion County rather than from private donations.
While the orphanage's operating funds were supplied by county government, its capital still had to come from private donations. The contributions were never numerous or large, and they were totally inadequate to permit the expansion necessitated by the large influx of blacks into Indianapolis during the World War I years. A 1918 report of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research, sponsored by the Indianapolis War Chest, criticized the Asylum for its unsafe and overcrowded conditions, and recommended that it be taken over by the state. No action was taken on the recommendation until 1922, when the Quakers gave up control of the orphanage to the Marion County Board of Commissioners.

""We found everything alright except that we utterly condemn the present insane department and recommend an entirely new structure. The new bathroom should be completed, and a cement floor should be places in the vegetable cellar. We commend the general management and cleanlinesss of the poor asylum."" [1]
According the the Census, the Jackson County Infirmary contained a total of 31 paupers in 1910. There were 17 males, 14 females. Twenty-nine were native to the area, and two were not. There was one reported death in 1910.[2]
The Jackson County Home once stood on South Jackson St in Brownstown. Land for the home was purchased in 1847 and the first building erected in 1850, it was a 16 x 25 foot log home. In March 1864 $5,000 was appropriated for building a county asylum. The 3 story brick building was torn down in 1975.

Four hundred acres had recently been purchased from John Torbet on Graham Creek in what is now Sections 31 and 36 of Vernon township; costing the taxpayers $8,500.00. On August 26, 1885 an article in the plain dealer stated ""John Berkman moved to Rochester, Minnesota, Wednesday morning. He had come to Jennings county in 1842 and was superintendent of the Poor Farm for 26 years. Mrs Berkman was a strong aid. The duties were so arduous they feel great relief at being free from the responsibilities during the remainder of their lives. They so conducted themselves and their business, that they go away regretted by everybody.""
An article in the June 20, 1888 Plain Dealer stated that over 200 of the 400 acres purchased were in cultivation and a larger and better residence had been built, (it does not mention if this is a new building or just additions.) There were 4 mules, 30 hogs and 40 head of cattle; a large granary was being constructed and a new barn was being contemplated. The inmates grew and ate their own food; 200 bushels of potatoes were put away each fall, as well as milk, butter, bread and garden vegetables. Wheat usually was in the excess of several hundred bushels.
The County Commissioners occasionally sent a committee to check on the status of things at the farm. Reports of these were written up in the local papers. The residence was an L shaped two story brick building with 26 rooms in all and a basement with four rooms; the interior was designed like a hotel with a fire escape. Two white wooden porches ran along the entire front of both stories of the building. A long brick building with jail house cells for inmates with senility or other frailties of that nature also housed a barber shop and wash house. There was a clapboard summer kitchen adjoining the main residence. The entire place was a working farm with 5 outhouses in a row, a slaughterhouse, five cisterns, one main barn, one corn crib and a smaller two story grain barn with tongue and groove planks on the second floor.
In February 1985 after its use as a Poor Farm was over the main residence burnt while George and Martha Franks were living there, the fire started in a flue and completely gutted the newly remodeled section of the building. John Hammons who had spent his childhood on the farm had purchased the farm and had planned to move in the next day.",1948,"Vernon, IN",,,[1868],[1985],[None],[None],[None],0

Indiana,Knox County Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Knox_County_Asylum,,,1881/1935,Demolished,Single Building,Joseph K. Frick,Knox County Poor Farm | Knox County Infirmary,"When Indiana became a state in 1816, the constitution contained a provision for counties to establish poor farms, but nothing was mandated. Then, in 1821, the General Assembly authorized eight commissioners to purchase a farm “for the purpose of it using it to house paupers.”  Around that time a log cabin-type structure was built out on what’s now Bunker Hill to serve as the poor farm and a modern brick building replaced it in the 1850s. The farm comprised 40 acres.
The poor farm stayed in that location until 1881, when an arsonist burned down the building. The county purchased the present poor farm site, on what’s now South Hart Street Road, shortly after that and started constructing a new building designed by Joseph Frick, an architect out of Evansville. The center served as the superintendent’s residence and the two wings that extended outward held separate quarters for male and female residence. Unlike the blueprint for other poor farm buildings across the state, the entrances into Knox County’s facility are located on the side of the main building. Frick also placed the kitchen and dining rooms in the basement, and a separate summer kitchen was constructed early in the 20th century. It still remains on the property.
The county’s poor farm continued serving as a home for the less fortunate until the 1920s, when it was turned over to Purdue University and converted into a “model farm,” an early predecessor to the current extension system. The poor farm residents were moved into a building on South First Street until 1935, at which point the county decided the city building wasn’t working and bought out the lease with Purdue. But by the 1960s, the farm had sold off most of the acreage and wasn’t functioning as a farming operation anymore.
Later, the building was used as office space for KCARC, during which the organization paid for many improvements to the aging structure, including putting in a new heating system, plumbing and electrical, all while leasing it to the county. But at some point, it became clear that maintenance on such an old building simply wasn’t cost-effective if KCARC couldn’t take ownership down the road. Eventually, KCARC let its lease with the county run out, and the building has been abandoned since. Local pastor Sandy Ivers with the group New Hope Center Inc. set her sights on the structure, envisioning a shelter program for women, and approached the county about obtaining the deed to the property. Seven years later, in June 2014, commissioners were finally able to sign over the deed to Ivers. By then, though, the building wasn’t in great shape. It badly needed — and still needs — a new roof, which could cost somewhere around $28,000 to fix, a project to be funded through donations.

The administration building was connected to the dormitories by large enclosed porches that could allow fresh air & sunlight. The dormitory wings are placed at an angle with the central group of buildings for sunlight and air & to facilitate courtyards for outdoor recreation.

Indiana,La Porte County Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=La_Porte_County_Asylum,1833.0,,1886 (Second Building),Active,Single Building,Chapman,,"In the 1830s, a few years after the organization of the county, the commissioners made provision for an asylum for the poor. They purchased land and built a county poor house and from time to time improved the possessions circumstances required. The poor farm originally consisted of the southeast quarter of section twenty-two in Center township, the left hand lower corner of which extends in Pine Lake. One of the men who served longest as superintendent of the county infirmary was Joseph M. Hoffman, who served sixteen years, having been selected by the county commissioners for that position in 1873. It is said that during his administration holidays were observed, and Sunday services held regularly at the poor farm. The southern half of the poor farm was purchased by the Pine Lake Cemetery Association as stated in the preceding chapter.
After this is was found that the farm was not adequate to the county's growing needs, and hence on February 7, 1886, the present county farm was purchased which contains large tracts in sections three and ten of Scipio township. After a new and commodious home had been erected for an infirmary, and other buildings had been provided, the poor and those who cared for them were removed to the new establishment, which has ever since been conducted successfully.
Among the most satisfactory administrations was that of Mr.Concannon. The total cost of maintaining the poor farm for 1891 was $3,500. Besides this there is the township poor relief in which Michigan township in 1891 stood at the head, relieving 223 persons; Center came next relieving 197, then Kankakee with 20, New Durham with 13, Noble and Cass with 11 each, while those of the other townships were not as many as ten, each. The total was 528.
Considering population and everything, LaPorte county has little poverty as compared with many other counties. And this has been so from the beginning. The same industrial conditions, bringing poverty in their wake, have not prevailed here. The ""slums"" are not in the county, to any great extent. In an early day, in Michigan City, the foreign element was limited to a few Irish and German families. There was but little suffering from poverty. Even what existed was caused more by sickness and misfortune then anything else, and the needs of the sufferers were soon found out and relieved by those who were more fortunately situated.
The hospital transferred most of it's mental patients after 1900 to Logansport State Hospital. The facility still operates today as a shelter for homeless.

Indiana,Marion County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Marion_County_Poor_Farm,,,1833,Demolished,Single Building,,Marion County Asylum,"Marion County’s poor farm got its start sometime in the 1830’s and the main building was originally a small log structure, later upgraded to a simple brick dormitory, and eventually a four story brick structure. This building was later replaced in the 1920's. One constant with the operations of the Marion County poor farm were regular controversies and scandals associated with the institution. Reports about the poor conditions and treatment of residents at the farm, and/or the corruption of the employees, regularly appeared in government reports and local newspapers.
The inaugural report from the State Board of Charities in 1889-90 described the Marion County poor farm facilities as they existed at that time, and the report was not positive. The main structure on the site was described as being made of brick and had a maximum capacity of 230 persons at a “crowded” state. The report noted that the structure was “very poorly designed for its purpose, especially in the matter of ventilation.” The dormitories within the poor house were “small and inconvenient,” there was a limited number of windows in the facility, and the day rooms were lacking. Water supply and bathrooms were also found to be deficient. A separate building from the main facility was used for housing African American men was found to be in “bad order.”
In 1901 bad conditions at the poor farm was again noted by the State Board of Charities. The Indianapolis News recounted that the Board’s report stating that the living conditions at the farm “would have a tendency to drive them [inmates] to insanity,” and that previous recommendations for repairs and improvements to the facility had not been acted upon. The state report described that there was “an odor throughout that premises that is almost unsufferable and must be injurious to the health of the inmates.” The Indianapolis News reported that state authorities had expected the poor farm to improve once the ‘insane’ residents were transferred to the new county Julietta Asylum.
The 1920's saw continued problems with mistreatment of poor farm residents and other scandals. The condition of the facilities also began to be an issue as the structure began to deteriorate and the county considered a new facility. After a few years of debates about funding the improvements, the contract was issued in July 1923. The new facility, intended to house men, replaced much of the older multistoried brick building with several one story dormitories. In the early 1930’s efforts were made to transfer the Marion County poor farm to the state as part of a deal which involved the Julietta County Insane Hospital. The plan was to transfer patients from Julietta to Central State, and then transfer the residents of the poor farm to the Julietta facility to serve as the new county infirmary. The poor farm property would then be transferred to the state and would be used by Central State Hospital. Part of the rationale for the move was to allow more space for the inmates at the poor farm, since Julietta had more space. The legislation to make this plan a reality was initially proposed in 1931, although political maneuvering and other delays prevented the transfer until a law was finally passed in 1937, and the 21st and Tibbs Marion County Poor Farm was transferred to the state in 1938.",1938,"Indianapolis, IN",,,,1938,230,,,0

In 1853 the farm was sold to Joseph Evans and the inmates were housed by the lowest bidders in their property. This continued until 1862 when the poor farm was constructed 1 mile north of Tyner in the NW section of the county. This second farm had a large 2-story wood frame house and several farm-related buildings. In 1891 in was suggested that this structure be replaced by one made of brick or stone. The county sold the farm and moved to new property purchased in 1891, closer to Plymouth. The third Marshall County Home was built between 1892-1895 and was designed by Wing & Mahurin. It is located on 196
acres of land purchased in 1891, 3 miles east of Plymouth along what would later become the Lincoln Highway/U.S. 30 (now bypassed). The development included a large bank barn, and
other agriculture structures which do not survive. It cost $79.547.50 to construct and had a capacity of 100 and followed the general design approved by the State Board of Charities.
In 1976 the county requested a study on the county home & it was suggested a new facility should be built. Instead money was raised to renovate the existing building & make an addition, while demolishing the infirmary building. The issues again came up in 1998. Instead of making needed repairs and upgrades, the county decided to sell the facility to a private owner. Today it is operated as the Otis R Bowen Center for Human Services, Shady Rest Home. It houses people from the age of 18 and older with serious mental and substance abuse issues.

It was called a Poor Farm because it was farmed by the occupants who raised their own food. It was called an Infirmary because many of its occupants were ill or feeble with old age.
Washington A. Coon was employed as Superintendent of the Asylum. As time went on and the county continued to grow, this facility became inadequate. The Jefferson Township Infirmary was exchanged for 160 acres in York Township, about one and one-half miles northwest of Albion. The move to the new home was made June 2, 1872.  After this date, the town of Mount Salem grew up in the area where the County Farm had been located. In 1873 Mount Salem contained a church, school house, blacksmith shop, and saw-mill. The Baltimore and Ohio railroad was being built through the south part of this area. William S. Hayes, editor of the New Era newspaper said, ""There is not a saloon in the place, which speaks well for the inhabitants. The people are mostly farmers and are all making money. Some ten or a dozen couples met at the residence of John A. Singrey, on Singrey Avenue, last Friday evening and had a general good time. We understand they put themselves outside of fifteen cans of oysters, besides an immense amount of other eatables.""
During its use, the property contained the main brick house, a hog house, a basement barn, a corn crib, a woodshop, and two small frame outbuildings. The property had a cemetery, now a part of Wright's Cemetery, at the intersection of Indiana Routes 500 N and 150 W. [1]

An earlier facility, known as the County Asylum or Poor Farm, was built about 1860, two miles down river from Spencer on State Road 67. It was a two story frame building, large enough, but by 1878 not large enough. The County traded that former Tornmy Howe farm for 395 acres known as the Col. John Franklin farm and let a contract to William F. McGenhardt to build a brick County Asylum for a cost of $8,000. The earlier house is still standing in good repair, and is the home of Bill Edwards. The outward appearance of the 1878 brick County Home, a pleasant well-maintained facility, has changed little over the years. The property no longer functions as a working farm, and the barn and other outbuildings have been torn down. Sixteen people resided at the County Home in 1994. Currently, the main asylum building is a private residence.
The property contains the main brick building, a cell house, a pole barn, a pump house, a workshop, a wash house, and a cemetery, located in the woods behind the home. [1]

The asylum was established in 1830 to house the county's most vulnerable people, including the poor, widowed, orphaned, and those with physical and mental disabilities. The original asylum burned down the same year and was rebuilt in 1856.
A third facility was constructed in 1930 under the guidance of Hoosier architect Carroll O. Beeson. The 25,000 square feet Neoclassical structure would be among one of the final few ""poor homes"" to be built, as the Social Security Act of 1935 would pave the way for our modern welfare system.
By the 1950's, there was no need for a poor asylum, and the facility was converted into an assisted living facility, originally called Parke County Nursing Home and later Parke County Residential Care Center. The facility closed its doors for good in 2010, and Mother Nature and vandals had their way with the facility, leaving it in shambles.

Kaufman,Randolph County Infirmary | Randolph County Home – Countryside Care,"Tract of land purchased by county about 1851 to house a poor farm to care for those unable to work, including the mentally and physically disabled, single mothers, elderly and orphans. Dwelling existed on premises that served as facility for a time, then serving 13 inmates. Residents were to maintain the farm, though many unable to perform labor due to age or infirmity. A new wooden building constructed in 1853, housing 16 inmates, however it was destroyed by fire less than year later in January 1854. A new two-story brick building constructed in 1855-56. This building eventually ordered demolished due to poor conditions, and new structure to be built to better accommodate growing patient population.
The new nearly 50,000-square-foot building (current structure) constructed in 1898-99. Housed six large wards, several private rooms, laundry, kitchen, separate dining rooms for women and men. Property included pump house, barn, hay barn, machine shed, garage or cell house, two garages, and chicken house on 350 acres. Five patients were still living in the infirmary when it closed in 2008. In 2016 the building was sold and is now open for tours.

Indiana,Ripley County Poor Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ripley_County_Poor_Asylum,1830.0,,1831,Demolished,Single Building,,,"On July 5, 1830, a committee of eight was appointed to inquire into the buying of a poor farm.  Stephen Hole, John C. McPheeters, and Joel Coombs were appointed to select and buy a farm. On January 3, 1831, a plot was bought for $1,000 from Noah Wright, with the price to be paid in 3 installments.  In March of 1831, Thomas Hedge, Henry DeWalt, and Rhodes Mead were appointed directors.  They were to employ an agent to run the farm.  Tilmon Hartley was hired for this position, and Dr. Charles Hay was hired to administer to the medical wants of the poor.
In 1838 Robinson and Huston built a frame addition to the poor home.  There were 11 paupers in the asylum at that time.  In 1872 a “mad house” was built on the poor farm at a cost of $245, and in 1878 a residence for the superintendent was erected at a cost of $593.
In 1904 a large brick building was constructed and improvements were made. More land was purchased and Matthew Kinney was superintendent.  In 1915 there were 30 males and 28 females cared for.  In 1926 the buildings were destroyed by fire, and the 47 inmates had to be housed in tents until a building could be completed.  The first buildings to be completed were the smoke and wash houses.  A new brick dormitory was completed by Shrum, Shrum, and Barrett in 1928.
By 1930, more patients came to live at the poor farm due to the Great Depression and the difficulty of finding jobs during this time.  Sometimes mothers with several children or whole families were housed there. By 1933 a count of 43 people were present; eventually other means became available to care for the indigent, unwed mothers, orphans, and outcasts so fewer and fewer were cared for in the county home. Only 6 persons were admitted after 1960; in 1970 only 4 residents remained and were placed in a convalescent home.  The farm was sold in September of 1970.",1970,"Versailles, IN",,,1831,1970,,,47,0

Indiana,Saint Joseph County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Saint_Joseph_County_Infirmary,1838.0,,1907,Active,Single Building,Freyermuth and Maurer,St. Joseph County Asylum and Poor Farm | Portage Manor,"Originally opened in 1846, referred to White Hall. Dorothea Dix wrote the following comments on St. Joseph County’s relief system in 1847: “The poor house and farm… is situated on Michigan Road, six or seven miles from South Bend. The farm contains 200 acres, with a remarkably pleasant and convenient family residence. The building in which the poor are kept is in the rear of this, and very defective in construction and the general plan, and poorly furnished. I found there but two who were dependent on the public and on the Superintendent for their support and daily comforts; one, an insane man, who had in the winter been found in the woods with his feet frozen; the other, an aged negroe. The number of inmates increases as the winter month’s advance. Formerly the poor were kept in the town, but serious evils attended this arrangement, and now the opposite extreme is adopted, they being too far removed to come under the frequent and benevolent supervision of official persons and the Christian visitor. The superintendent receives compensation for carrying on the farm, and I think receives all supplies for family use from the overseers, a plan not likely to prove either economical or satisfactory, or at all desirable.”
The state constitution expanded required care in 1851 to the insane, deaf and blind. It specified, “treatment and attempted cure of patients for custodial care without treatment.” Thus, it recognized the need for assuming responsibility for both curable and incurable insane. Yet, at that time, the terms “insane” and “feebleminded” could mean anything from Down Syndrome to active psychosis to learning disabilities to less than average intelligence to stating or displaying some peculiar views or beliefs with regards to various societal “norms.” However, there was generally an accepted differentiation between the harmless insane and the dangerous insane. The county commissioners purchased a plot of 240 acres and ordered construction of poorhouse facilities the following year, which was completed by 1857.
The St. Joseph County poorhouse was intentionally located on land between the two townships that supplied most of the admissions (Penn and Portage.) It was considered to be far enough removed from the city of South Bend so as to be less affected by that evil influence. But by the turn of the century, the State Board of Charities sharply criticized the facility and the property was deemed to be much more valuable for other uses by the city. Some of the Asylum area eventually became Potawatomie Park.
The current 113.8 acre location on Portage Prairie was obtained in 1905 and several buildings were erected including the main building (dubbed The St. Joseph County Infirmary and, later Portage Manor or at times as the County Home or the County Poor Farm) along with the farm (specified as the Cleveland Road Farm) and the pauper’s cemetery (initially known as Potter’s Field while at other times denoted as The St. Joseph County Cemetery or even as Portage Cemetery.) In future years, the three would at times continue to be perceived as separate entities, while at other times would be construed to be one entity together (the St. Joseph County Asylum and Poor Farm.)
By the 1930s, the facility became so overcrowded that patients determined as ""feeble-minded"" had to be housed with the insane. The total number of residents living here rose to 298 in 1937 and peaked at 351 in February 1939. The hospital was built to house about only 120. By the early 1950s, those diagnosed with severe mental illness were moved to Norman Beatty Mental Hospital. The lock-up cells however, were used through the 1970s for those that had escaped, were a danger to others or frequently broke rules. In the late 1970s the facility changed it's name to Portage Manor and farming operations ceased. Today the main focus of the facility is residential long-term care.

Indiana,Scott County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Scott_County_Poor_Farm,,,1861 (Original location),Preserved,Single Building,Johan J. Wiley,Scott County Home,"The first Scott County Home was located three miles north of Lexington, the first county seat and was built in 1861, 41 years after the establishment of Scott County by the Indiana Legislature, on 110 acres by James Hallenbeck. This home was used until 1879 when the Courthouse was moved to Scottsburg, the new county seat. The two-story brick structure was built around 1890 to replace an earlier frame building on the same site.  The Indiana Board of State Charities and Corrections was established in 1899 and was required by Indiana law to examine the condition and management of the county homes and make an annual report to the Governor for the use of the Legislature.  Under the reporting system by the board, county asylums greatly improved.
While the acreage surrounding the home was reduced greatly over the years, the building continued to function as a poor house until 1973.  At this time offices for Scott County public services and government moved in and a few remaining residents were relocated. The building continued to function in this capacity until 1995 when an addition to the Scott County Courthouse fulfilled the need for extra space. Of the 92 county homes, only 31 remain standing.  The Scott County Home remains unaltered in regard to architecture, location, and interior layout.  Those changes that have been made throughout the years are largely superficial and could easily be restored to their original. On May 26, 2000, the Scott County Home was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Constructed in 1896, the red brick, tan brick and limestone Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne structure looks similar to those in Marshall and Kosciusko counties and features the same materials and styles. This building is the fourth dedicated county home located in Sullivan County. The earliest home was established on an existing farm in 1855 after years of boarding the poor in local homes. The first new asylum was built in 1865 and it was replaced in 1885. Approximately ten years later better security and sanitary conditions were necessary, so the current building facility was constructed just east of the city of Sullivan. A long lane lined with trees and wrought iron fencing divided the expansive lawn. 
The 2 1/2-story building was split into three sections: the central projecting superintendent’s residence, the two wings to either side that are set back and separated male and female residents, and the rear north wing that holds the support functions for the facility. The complex as a whole is cross shaped with the residence in the bottom part of the cross. The whole facility features steeply pitched gables and roofs, but the superintendent’s house has a 3 ½ story tower and a 2 ½ story turret setting it apart from the rest of the building. The wings have five sleeping rooms per floor per wing for a total of 20 rooms. Additionally, the wings house separate bathrooms, sitting rooms, and dining rooms for each gender. The north wing contains a large kitchen, laundry facility, staff rooms, and mechanicals.
None of the agricultural buildings remain but there is a small two-room cottage on site that dates to 1925. Over the years, the name of the property has changed. In 1947 it became the Sullivan County Home. Thirty years later, in 1977, it became Lakeview Rest Home and the adjacent park and lake were built. The old poor home cemetery is located in the park. Some of the acreage was transferred from agricultural use to other county functions in the 1980s. Current neighbors include the 4-H fairground, the county highway department, and a golf course. The Sullivan County Poor Home closed in 1998 and is currently vacant.

The county home served the community until 1940. The home us currently privately owned and no longer functioning as a poor house. [1]
According to the March 31 1922 Indiana Bulletin:
""This is an old stone building, lacking all conveniences. The institution is clean. It is lighted by kerosene and heated by stoves. The ventilation comes from the windows. The water is supplied by means of a hand pump and there is also a cistern. There is no fire protection. One bath tub is located in the wash house. The closets are out of doors. The furniture consists of beds, chairs, stands, pictures. The bedding is clean.
Management. The superintendent receives $500 per year and the matron $200 per year. A physician comes on call. Supplies are not purchased by competitive bids. The records are satisfactory. There are no rules. Inmates are received on a written order from the township trustee. The commissioners visit the poor asylum occasionally.
Inmates. Population: 3 men, 3 women. There is good sex separation. The inmates are clean. They bathe once a week and change their clothing weekly. The general health is good. Three meals a day are served, prepared by the matron with the assistance of the inmates. Religious services are not held.
Recent Improvements. A new tin roof has been put on, a horse and eleven swine have been purchased.
Recommendations. The county should have a new poor asylum on good land.""[2]

Indiana,Union County Poorhouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Union_County_Poorhouse,,,1889,Preserved,Single Building,G.W. Bunting and Son,Tri-County Poor Farm | Union County Home,"In 1834, the Indiana Legislature authorized an asylum for the poor in Fayette, Franklin, and Union counties. Representatives from the three counties purchased the Thomas Clark farm, 208 acres in Jackson Township. There a small brick building was constructed and opened to residents in the spring of 1835. This facility was in use until June 1856, when Union County bought out the other two counties for the property. The stipulation was that residents from Fayette and Franklin counties had to be removed from the farm by fall of that same year. Fayette moved their poor farm northwest of Connersville and Franklin built their farm south of Brookville. Unfortunately, both have been demolished. It is unknown how long Union County remained at the Tri-County Poor Farm, but c.1875 constructed a new poor farm northeast of Liberty, near Kitchel. This building still stands.
The property in Fayette County is the second oldest existing county home property in Indiana and the only known instance of multiple counties combining resources to serve those in need. The facility served as a county home until 1975. Today two of the main buildings associated with the history of the poor farm remain on the Tri-County Poor Farm site. The main house, which was likely used by the superintendent and his family, still exists and the large L-shaped barn is there. Some of the outbuildings on the property may date from the county home time period but it is not known for sure. It was located south of the main house. The property is now privately owned and functions as a single family dwelling.

Indiana,Vanderburgh County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Vanderburgh_County_Poor_Farm,1838.0,,1882,Demolished,Single Building,,Pleasantview Rest Home,"Established in Vanderburgh County in 1838, the Asylum for the Poor was an attempt to care for the indigent of the county.  At the time the state was founded, Indiana law allowed for the poor and paupers in the parlance of the time to be auctioned for hire. They were sold for the cost of room and board and forced to work for their buyer in the form of indentured servitude. The Asylum featured a poor farm but closed shortly after it was opened and in 1882, after a second farm failed, the county purchased 161-acres of land in Center Township for the construction of a larger Vanderburgh County Poorhouse.
Located between Evansville and McCutchanville, near what is now known as the corner of Senate Ave. and Weaver Rd., the facility was renamed the County Home shortly after it was opened. Able-bodied residents were expected to work on the farm to help cover the county’s cost for their care.  Residential numbers within the home varied but peaked to 210 people in 1941. Over time, the population of the County Home aged and shrank and in 1971 the home changed its name yet again to Pleasant View Rest Home.
The original building was demolished three years later in 1974, and the county officially closed Pleasant View Rest Home in 1976.  The dormitory building was later converted into apartments and much of the farmland was then leased to form Hamilton Golf Course, now known as Thunderbolt Pass.

By 1865, due in large part to the rapidly growing city of Terre Haute, the house was no longer adequate to care for the poor of the county and the house was sold. In 1866, a new site for the Home, located on what is now Maple Avenue, was purchased and construction on a new building soon follows. The County Home was rebuilt again in 1936 with an expansion in 1976.

Poor Farm (also known as the County Infirmary or County Home) was begun in the 1850s and played a major role in the care of people who, because of poverty, infirmity, disability or old age, were unable to care for themselves. It was overseen by an institution manager who had similar responsibilities as the township trustees. It was a working farm that produced the grain, livestock and garden produce that it consumed. House rules were strict and accommodations were minimal.
It continued in operation into the mid-1970s and was actively supported by local churches, benevolent societies such as the Red Cross and Salvation Army, local fraternal organizations and even schools. During the 120 years of its existence, there were a total of 3 houses. At times it experienced fires, mismanagement and neglect. Understandably, it saw its highest population during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and received assistance from various New Deal reform programs at that time, including Social Security.

The property is now used a apartments. [1]
According to ""A 1918 History of Wells County,"",
""The County Infirmary and Orphans' Asylum is located a few miles
southeast of Bluffton, on the southwest quarter of section 23, Harrison
Township. The original farm of 156 acres was purchased in 1864, and the
main building of the Infirmary, a substantial brick structure, was
completed in 1875 at a cost of about $16,000. Various improvements have
been made, including the installation of a modern steam heating plant,
electric light plant, individual baths, and toilet accommodations
within doors. In 1900 the large barn was destroyed by fire and a new
building erected soon after at a cost of $6,000. The County Infirmary
has accommodations for about sixty inmates.""[2]

They were paid by the county for expenses & boarding. The first county home was built on a 200 acre farm in 1857. A second wood frame building was constructed in 1875 to accommodate more inmate, but by 1907 was deemed ""unsanitary and dangerous"" to the inmates.
Construction on the new building in 1907 at a new location, 3 miles north of Monticello on the Tippecanoe River. It opened December of 1908 despite complaints of some of the locals about it's location. In 1911 there were 27 inmates, 15 of them over the age of 60. Eight years later they had 31 inmates. The 1927 state report on the asylum reported concern that there was no care for inmates that were insane, and in 1938 it had not been addressed, also 10 inmates were sleeping on the floor.
By 1941 the asylum had 42 inmates. It was reported at that time that an additional 6 inmates were housed in ""detention housing"", segregated cages in the 1-story annex at the rear of the building. There was also concern about locked doors and lack of fire escapes. 1950 brought about improvements, including tubular fire escapes. Water supply had been improved and several other upgrades to the building & farm.
Later years the population began to decline steadily, mentally ill people from the county were sent to Logansport State Hospital for treatment. By 1998, there were only 15 inmates & in 2009 the county decided to close the facility for budgetary reasons. In May-June 2017, the building was torn down.",2009,"Monticello, IN",Queen Anne,,1908,2009,,,42,0

Indiana,Indiana State Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Indiana_State_Sanatorium,1907.0,1907,1911,Closed,Cottage Planned,,Indiana State Tuberculosis Hospital | Lee Alan Bryant Healthcare,"The Indiana State Sanatorium (1909-1968), also known as the ""Indiana Tuberculosis Hospital"", and formerly the Lee Alan Bryant Healthcare Facility (1978-2012), was a state-run institution designated for the treatment and care of Tuberculosis patients located in Rockville, Indiana. The facility was successful in its treatment of the disease, and the overall mortality rate decreased. The Sanatorium was shuttered in 1968 due to the low number of patients. In the mid-1970s, private investors proposed to convert the space into a nursing home. The facility now known as Lee Alan Bryant was opened in 1978, and gained a negative reputation due to understaffing which resulted the facility to be closed by the state in 2011. The property sat vacant for a decade before being purchased in December of 2020. The new owner hopes to reopen it as a mix-use facility.
In 1905 the state of Indiana appointed a committee to investigate the need of a state-run institution. By 1907 the state legislature appropriated $250,000 for the purchase of a site. A second committee was then created to determine where the site will should be located. The final decision was to purchase 504 acres of land east of Rockville. In 1909, the committee requested funds to build a hospital, which was soon followed by an administration building, power house, and two pavilions flanking the administration building, one for men, the other for women.[1] The main wards featured porches that stretched the entire length of the building for maximum exposure to fresh air (a common practice against Tuberculosis). By 1911, the facility was self-sufficient with a farm and workers. By 1918, a school was added to the facility. A superintendent's residence was added in 1922, which was followed by two small bungalow style houses for physicians.
The grounds underwent many changes throughout it's existence. The first major additions came in the 1950s with the addition of a chapel in 1950 and a new 5-story staff housing building (later converted into a psychiatric hospital) known as ""Adams Hall."" By the late 1950s, the number of patients fell considerably due to the discovery of a treatment to cure the disease. As a result, the facility could not admit enough patients to remain open and was shuttered by the state in 1968.
By the 1970s, private investors and the state planned to repurpose the complex as an assisted living facility. They proposed that the build a modern new complex replacing an old Tuberculosis ward between the Administration Building and Adams Hall. This was completed in 1978, and soon opened. However, there was a lack of patients that plagued the facility. In an effort to gain more patients, the state transferred patients from other state mental institutions which resulted in the mixing of both patients deemed ""mentally ill"" and patients in need of assisted living care.
The mixing of patients garnered much negative attention toward the facility and became the site of numerous accidents and tragedies as a result of mistreatment and ill-conduct. In 2006, a patient reportedly went missing from the facility. Authorities later found him deceased in the woods. Another incident happened in 2009, when a disgruntled employee shot a fellow co-worker in the facility's power house. The assailant then took his own life following the murder. The facility would loose its license in 2011, only to close by 2012.
The facility was purchased in 2020, and the current owner plans to redevelop the complex into a mix-use facility by restoring the 1908 Administration Building. Currently the facility offers both historical and paranormal tours.",2012,"Rockville, IN",,,1909,1968,,,,0
Indiana,Kehrer Tuberculosis Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kehrer_Tuberculosis_Hospital,,,1924,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Ella B. Kehrer Tuberculosis Hospital,"Named the Ella B. Kehrer Tuberculosis Hospital for the local woman who was the driving force behind its establishment, the hospital provided comfort and rest for tubercular patients of Madison County. The hospital was dedicated in 1924 to the memory of the soldiers and sailors from Madison County who lost their lives through tuberculosis while serving in World War I. Thirteen acres in a beautiful forest of trees contained three cottages built to house 22 adults and 25 children. When it opened, the hospital was equipped with almost every convenience for the proper treatment of patients. The large screened sleeping porches which surrounded each cottage made it possible for patients to sleep protected in the fresh air which was considered essential to their treatment.
The largest of the three cottages, a two-story structure, measured 36-by-42 feet, and the other two were one-story structures measuring 28-by-35 feet. The largest cottage contained a dining hall and kitchen on the first floor; the second floor was used for sleeping quarters. The other two cottages were devoted entirely to sleeping quarters.
An important feature of the hospital was called the Children’s Preventorium. It was a summer health camp for sick children. For two months each summer children could receive good food, medical /dental care and education in good health habits. Ability to pay did not affect treatment at the hospital. County residents were charged $5 a week, but those who were poor received free treatment. Out-of-county residents paid $15 a week.
Changing Indiana hospital standards and other options available to Indiana’s tuberculosis patients brought the closing of the hospital in 1947. Afterwards, thought was given to making a nursing home on the property, but in time the buildings deteriorated. The property which is now called Tanglewood is owned by the Anderson Community Schools. It is estimated that 3,000 patients were given care at the hospital, and thousands of others benefited through clinics conducted at the hospital during its twenty-three years of operation. Today, nothing remains of the institution that was located at the east end of Tenth Street on the bluffs 100 feet above White River.",1947,"Anderson, IN",,,1924,1947,,3000,,0
Indiana,Irene Byron Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Irene_Byron_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,,1916,1919,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"In 1913 Irene Byron, a young graduate of the Hope Hospital Training Program for Nurses, began work as the visiting nurse for the Anti Tuberculosis League. In this role, she had responsibility for educating patients in the importance of sanitation. If the disease were caught in the early stages, a good diet, fresh air, and rest could help patients recover. Miss Byron and other leaders of the Anti Tuberculosis League quickly learned, however, that Fort Wayne was experiencing a tuberculosis epidemic. By September of 1913 more than 600 local residents were suffering from the disease. Two hundred were so sick that nothing short of a miracle could save them. Most of the remaining 400 victims might survive if they could be propery cared for. While tuberculosis sanitariums were becoming established elsewhere, Fort Wayne at this time lacked such facilities.
As a first step, the Anti Tuberculosis League opened a free clinic and dispensary. Irene Byron, now as the league's executive secretary, took responsibility for supervising programs of home care. In the summer of 1914 Irene Byron began campaigning for an outdoor hospital that would enforce strict rules of rest, diet, and fresh air. Thanks largely to her efforts, the following spring the Anti Tuberculosis League opened Fort Recovery, a group of wooden huts that housed twenty patients, even very young children.
Miss Byron continued to care for hundreds of other patients in their homes. At the same time she crusaded for a fresh air school to help underweight chidren become more robust. Irene Byron clearly risked her life through her regular visits with TB patients. By the winter of 1915, such exposre had taken its toll, for she was forced to take an extended leave of absence to visit family in California. She apparently regained her health, for when the call went out in the fall of 1917 for nurses to serve in World War I, she was one of the first from Fort Wayne to sign up. Knowingly, she again risked her life to care for soldiers stationed at Camp McArthur in Waco, Texas, stricken with influenza. Despite the hardships she faced, she hoped to be sent to war areas in France.
Within less than six months in Texas, however, Miss Byron died, becoming Allen County's first woman martyr of the war. She was only 36 years old. Irene Byron's efforts to fight tuberculosis in Fort Wayne nevertheless continued. In the summer of 1919 a new modern sanitarium was dedicated in her honor to care for soldiers returning from service.",1974,"Ft. Wayne, IN",,,1919,,,,,0

Beasley and Harvey A. Moore who planned to produce the finest treatment for tuberculosis patients which was a serious disease at the time. About 20 physicians and Merchants National Bank in Indianapolis were financial backers of this enterprise as everyone saw this as a breakthrough method of treating TB. At the age of 26, Dr. Beasley was director and president of Rockwood and he was already well-known in the early 1900s for his successful treatment of TB.
Patients at Rockwood endured the cold winters living in small unheated cottages with “window sides,” that were opened while patients slept. The idea being the cold fresh air was important to treat the disease. The accepted practice of the time was to send patients to hot, dry, western states and Dr. Beasley as saw this as too outlandish. His idea was to treat patients in the climate in which it was originally contracted and he thought the clean country air in Avon was a perfect place for treatment.
Rockwood produced nearly all its own food and patients were provided full, balanced meals plus extra meals of raw eggs and fruit. All the vegetables, meat, and dairy products including the maple syrup came from the rich farmlands in the “White Lick Valley,” which Rockwood owned. Ice for summer use was cut from Whitelick Creek and stored in sawdust. Charges for a double cottage were $18 a week and $25 a week for a private cottage.
The initial mortality rate of TB patients at Rockwood was extremely high; 34.9 per cent died in a one-month period. Those statistics couldn’t have helped the sanitarium’s reputation. Around the same time  new drugs and vaccines made recovery quicker and the need for long therapy the sanitarium provided was lessening by 1910. So advances in treatments doomed Rockwood’s success and it closed it’s doors and was sold in 1913 just  6 years after is opened.
After it closed in 1913 Charles and Violet Isaacs purchased the property west of CR 625E which has the original three-story building that was the recreation center and living quarters for Rockwood’s interns, nurses and servants. The building was a mess and they lived in the servants quarters while they fixed the home and added the south and north wings of the current home. Most of the cottages were purchased and moved off the property but 2 old outbuildings are still there on what is now a 3 acre lot.",1913,,,,1907,1913,,,,0

Indiana,Silvercrest Childrens Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Silvercrest_Sanatorium,1924.0,,1936,Preserved,Single Building,,Silvercrest Sanatorium | Southern Indiana Tuberculosis Hospital | Silvercrest State Hospital,"In 1924, the FCTA (Floyd County Tuberculosis Association) purchased the old Handy farm on Old Vincennes Road for $6,500,which included a total of 42 acres, 20 of which were flat, hilltop land. The funds for the hospital were secured by popular subscription from the citizens of New Albany and by city-wide fund raising efforts. Fund raising events included everything from neighborhood skits, as the one given at the Hackett residence at 1732 DePauw Avenue by the neighborhood children charging a 3-cent admission, to a more elaborate pageant produced at Glenwood Park in 1923. This pageant, The Greatest Gift: A Pageant of Health, was written for the benefit of the FCTA, had a cast of 1000 members, and was seen by thousands of people from New Albany, Jeffersonville and Louisville. Pathé News shot a movie of the pageant and it played at the Grand Theater the following Sunday. By 1936, fund raising efforts allowed a 20-bed sanatorium to open on the site. In July 1938, twelve years from the date of purchase of the land, the Indiana General Assembly held a special session to enact a bill locating a site for the Southern Indiana Tuberculosis Hospital.
The hospital was a Public Works Administration project and Indianapolis architect August Bohlen was chosen to draw up the plans. Construction began immediately, and by August 1940, the $1 million, 150-bed hospital received its first patients. A unique feature of the hospital was that it provided individual rooms for the patients instead of the more widely used ward facilities. Silvercrest included an outpatient clinic with numerous laboratories, surgery rooms, kitchen and laundry facilities, and a dental office on site. The original complex included the main building, a residence built for the superintendent, and several guest houses. The hospital served a 32-county area and when the facility opened, it was too busy
ministering to its 150 patients to take time out for a formal dedication. On May 10, 1941, state and local dignitaries, including Indiana Gov. Henry F. Schricker, gathered at the site for the long awaited dedication.
By December 1952, five motel-type structures, along with two large residences, were added and dedicated to the medical campus totaling $275,000.00. Hawkins and Walker, well known New Albany architects, drew up the plans, and Sheperd and Rogers, also of New Albany, were the contractors.
The State began to phase out operations at Silvercrest on April 1, 1972. The site was used as the Silvercrest Children’s Development Center until 2006. In 2013 the main building was re-opened as a senior living center,The Villages at Historic Silvercrest, after a $16 million renovation.",2006,"New Albany, IN",Art Moderne and Art Deco,,1940,2006,150,,150,0

Indiana,Wabash Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wabash_Sanitarium,,,1906,Demolished,Single Building,,Wabash Valley Hospital  | Wabash Valley Mental Health Center,"The Wabash Valley Hospital was established as a Seventh-day Adventist institution in 1906 under the direction of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. The facility rested on 25 acres of land along the Wabash River and was originally recorded as “Indiana Medical Missionary and Benevolent Association”.
In its beginning it was operated as a general hospital, specializing in hydrotherapy and dietary regimens. In the 20's it operated a three-year nurses course. In the early 30's the emphasis was on nervous disorders. It continued as an institution of the church until 1931, and at the time it was sold to Roy Kinzer, a local Adventist businessman. In 1939 a non-profit corporation was formed to operate the “San”, and emphasis became “rest-cure”, and hospitalization was lengthy. In 1969, the facility merged and became the Mental Health Center for Tippecanoe County.
Wabash Valley Sanitarium was founded by Ellen G White (Seventh Day Adventist)",,"Lafayette, IN",,,[1906],[1969],,,,1

Indiana,Fairview Settlemlent,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fairview_Settlemlent,,,1907,Closed,Cottage Plan,,,"Fairview Settlement, organized and operated by the Indianapolis Benevolent Society (today Families First) on five acres at the location of 42nd and Haughey, Indianapolis, Indiana, was in operation from 1907 to about 1920, to provide housing and support for widows and their children. Many of the structures (up to 20 per Sanborn Fire Maps) on the property had been built by out-of-work men for Rev. Oscar McCullough's Summer Mission for Sick Children, started around the turn of the 20th Century.  It appears that Fairview Settlement may have been an outgrowth of Rev. McCullough's endeavors to further meet the greater needs of poor widows with children, especially after the Panic of 1907-08. From newspaper accounts it seems this Settlement was home to some of the following buildings and programs:  the Spann Nursery; the McCullough Hospital for Children; a dispensary (1915); Eliza Blaker's all day Kindergarten #28 (which showed 19 students in 1917); The Student Building (site of boys and girls vocational training); The Children's Club (1915); a bathhouse; six cottages; six tent cottages (1915); the Kirshbaum, the Mystic Tie, the Independent, the Anniversary, the Lockerbie, Calumet, Ashland, Charlotte (dorms); the Bonnie Marie (administration building); and various other structures.
This location eventually became part of Butler University and Christian Theological Seminary.",,"Indianapolis, IN",,,1907,1920,,,,1
