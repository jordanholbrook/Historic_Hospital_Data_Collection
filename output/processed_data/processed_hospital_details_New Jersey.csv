New Jersey,Brisbane State Child Treatment Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brisbane_State_Child_Treatment_Center,,,1947,Demolished,Single Building,,Arthur Brisbane State Child Treatment Center,"Arthur Brisbane was a distinguished New York City newspaperman who died in 1936. He bequeathed 1,200 acres in Wall to the state of New Jersey, which turned much of it into Allaire State Park. The original plan was to turn his mansion and surrounding buildings into a convalescent home for World War II veterans.
On November 1, 1946 the Children's Unit of Marlboro State Hospital was moved to this property and continued as a satellite of Marlboro State hospital. By authority of R. S. 30 :4-177.1 it became a separate institution on July 1, 1947. Subsequent experience led to the recognition of the need for an open type residential treatment center for pre-adolescent mentally ill children in addition to the children's units in State Hospitals.[1] In 1947, Brisbane opened as a state hospital for the observation, care and treatment of children with mental illness between the ages of 5 and 12. The hospital continued serving as an inpatient psychiatric facility for children under age 14 until the late 1980's. At that time, the Adolescent Unit at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital was closed as a result of the Slocum v. Perselay litigation and Brisbane began functioning, as it currently does, as an acute, psychiatric inpatient facility for youth ages 11 to 17 years.
Following the death of an adolescent patient in the Adolescent Unit at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital, the Public Advocate filed the Complaint in Slocum v. Perselay on June 27, 1986, in New Jersey Superior Court, Law Division, Mercer County. The action, in lieu of prerogative writ, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent further harm to the children hospitalized there caused by improperly trained staff, lack of proper supervision, improper use of restraints, overuse of chemical restraints, lack of fresh air and exercise, and the failure to identify or develop appropriate and less-restrictive placements.
On May 20, 1988, a Consent Order with Partial Stipulation of Settlement and Dismissal was filed, requiring the complete closing of the Adolescent Unit at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital by December 31, 1988. Incorporated into the Consent Order was the State Plan for the Establishment of Regional Psychiatric Programs for Seriously Mentally Ill Children and Adolescents, dated February 1987. This Plan called for the development of: 40 additional CCIS beds statewide to serve all children who required inpatient care at the regional level for the first 28 days; post-28 day inpatient care; mental health services for 5 to 10 year olds; mental health services within the Division of Developmental Disabilities and in the Department of Corrections at Jamesburg; and a 40-bed unit at Brisbane to serve as a ""Statewide Back-Up Unit"" for severely mentally ill adolescents in need of extended hospitalization.[2]
The child treatment center had a rocky history. In 1998, a 17-year-old patient was killed after being placed in a ""basket hold"" by an employee after she became upset. The state ruled the hold contributed to the patient's death, but a grand jury declined to indict the employee. An Asbury Park Press editorial at the time called the center “a place to dump adolescents with serious mental problems, rather than a place where these young people can get suitable treatment.” Shortly before it closed for good, a 2004 report from a panel of child welfare experts concluded that Brisbane ""patients are at constant risk because the facility is overcrowded, in poor condition, offers little treatment and employs unqualified workers.” In 2015, the Department of Children and Families removed dozens of boxes containing patient records that had been left in an unsecured building after the Press reported on them.

New Jersey,Greystone Park State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Greystone_Park_State_Hospital,1871,,1876,Demolished (Original buildings),Kirkbride Plan,,New Jersey State Lunatic Asylum at Morristown | Morristown State Hospital | Morris Plains State Hospital  | Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital (Current),"Originally opened on August 17, 1876, the hospital was known as the New Jersey State Lunatic Asylum at Morristown. The asylum officially received the familiar Greystone Park name in 1924. The idea for such a facility was conceived in the early 1870s at the persistent lobbying of Dorothea Lynde Dix, a former school teacher who was an advocate for better health care for people with mental illnesses. Because of her efforts, the New Jersey Legislature appropriated $2.5 million dollars to obtain about 3.007 square kilometers (743 acres) of land for New Jersey’s second ""lunatic asylum."" Great care was taken to select a location central to the majority of New Jersey's population near Morristown, Parsippany, and Newark. The land Greystone was built on was purchased by the state in two installments between 1871 and 1872 for a total of $146,000.
At this time in history, New Jersey's state-funded mental health facilities were exceedingly overcrowded and sub par compared to neighboring states that had more facilities and room to house patients. Greystone was built, all 62,589 m² (673,706 ft²) of it, in part to relieve the only — and severely overcrowded — ""lunatic asylum"" in the state, which was located in Trenton, New Jersey. In fact, Greystone's initial 292 patients were transferred from the Trenton facility to Greystone based on geographic distribution, setting precedent for Greystone to become the facility that would generally accept patients whose residences were in the northern part of the state. This proved to be the very reason why Greystone quickly became overcrowded in the heavily-populated North while the Trenton facility's number of patients remained relatively stable in the sparsely populated South.
In just four years after Greystone opened, it was already accommodating around 800 patients in a facility designed for 600. By 1887, the exercise rooms and attic space were converted to dormitories to create extra rooms for the influx of new patients. In an attempt to relieve the further overcrowding, the Dormitory Building was built behind the Main Building in 1901. It, however, wasn't enough to ameliorate the problem and thus in the same year the dining rooms on each floor had to be converted into dormitories as well. 13 years later, in 1914, the facility housed 2,412 patients, but now had an absolute maximum capacity of 1,600.
The next few decades saw a flurry of construction as supply was scrambling to meet demand. Of note was a new reception building named after the influential Greystone superintendent, Marcus Curry. Patient numbers are believed to have peaked in 1953 with an impressive 7,674 people packed into spaces designed for significantly fewer. An explanation for this dramatic increase can be found in the fact that World War II had ended and left many soldiers requiring treatment for Post-traumatic stress disorder, which included procedures such as Insulin shock therapy and Electroconvulsive therapy. Greystone was one of the few places in the country capable of treating such patients.
The 1970s and 1980s finally saw some weight lifted from this overcrowded facility because of the trend toward de-institutionalization, which was a direct effect of the use of Thorazine, one of the first drugs that was capable of treating the mentally ill. The trend continued to a point when Greystone was only a 550-bed facility when then Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman announced in 2000 that the state was going to close the facility by 2003. Some patients were slowly transferred to smaller-capacity programs, reducing the number of residential patients to approximately 450 in 2005. Then, on September 8, 2005, the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority closed a $186,565,000 bond issue on behalf of the State of New Jersey Department of Human Services for the completion of a new, 43,000 m² (460,000 ft²) Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, which is scheduled to be open in October 2007, still with a shortage of about 75 beds.
The decision to close Greystone in 2000 came about not only because of concerns for the aging buildings, but also due to the recent negative press it was receiving. Specifically, accounts of sexual assault in a hospital elevator, patients committing suicide, patients becoming pregnant, and a twice-convicted rapist escaping did not help Greystone's public image. The last patient left Greystone's Kirkbride building (the main building) in 1988 and, except for a tiny section preserved for administrative offices, the state shut off the heat, turned out the lights and walked away.
The current Greystone campus covers over a square mile and consists of 43 buildings.
The original Second Empire Victorian style building was 62,589 m² (673,706 total square feet). At the base of this massive building was the alleged largest continuous foundation in the United States from the time it was built until it was surpassed by the Pentagon when it was constructed in 1943. However, many other Kirkbride asylum buildings (such as the Ohio State Asylum for the Insane) also lay a claim to this fame and it has not been verified which one is true. The building has a characteristic linear arrangement, which was designed to the specifications of the Kirkbride Plan. The main building has a center section that was used for administrative purposes with three wings radiating out from the center, each about 42.7 meters (140 ft) long. They were set back from the previous one so that patients could enjoy the beauty of the outside surroundings. This was a central concept, along with moral treatment, that was the hallmark of the Kirkbride Plan for treating the mentally ill. The building form itself was meant to promote treatment and have a curative effect.
Each ward was initially set up to accommodate 20 patients. Each was furnished with a dining room, exercise room, and parlor. Most wards had wool rugs that ran the full length of the corridors. Other amenities included Victorian stuffed furniture, pianos, pictures, curtains and fresh flowers. Though not all wards were created equally. Wards that housed the most excitable patients were sparsely furnished — presumably for their own safety — with sturdy oak furniture.
Initial fees were $3.50 per week for a normal patient. For persons seeking private apartment-style living, the rent could be anywhere from $5.00 to $10.00 per week.
During the time that Greystone was built, the predominant philosophy in psychology was that the mentally ill could be cured or treated, but only if they were in an environment designed to deal with them. A major proponent of this philosophy was Thomas Story Kirkbride, who participated in the design phase of the main building at Greystone, though the two main designers were architect Samuel Sloan and Trenton State Asylum Superintendent Horace Buttolph (a friend of Kirkbride's). The building was constructed and furnished according to Kirkbride's philosophy, which proposed housing no more than 250 patients in a three story building. The rooms were to be light and airy with only two patients to a room. To reduce the likelihood of fires, Greystone and other Kirkbride asylums were constructed using stone, brick, slate and iron, using as little wood as possible. A street on the Greystone Park campus bears Buttolph's name.
The Greystone campus itself was once a self-contained community that included staff housing, a post office, fire and police stations, a working farm, and vocational and recreational facilities. It also had its own gas and water utilities and a gneiss quarry, which was the source of the Greystone building material. Below the building, a series of tunnels and rails connect the many sections. Its self-sufficient design is a testament to the legacy of the asylums of its era. Like the layout and interior of the building, the Greystone grounds with rolling greens, lavish gardens, and fountain features were designed to aid in the treatment of the mentally ill.
Until 2003, the future of most of the historic buildings was uncertain. Many of the buildings are vacant and need major repairs. Preservationists have been working for several years to guarantee the survival of this complex of buildings. Morris County had been negotiating with the State of New Jersey to take over vacant structures for non-profit agencies. In 2003, Morris County finalized plans to purchase about 300 acres (1.2 km²) of Greystone Park from the state for $1.00. The purchase included many of the vacant, dilapidated buildings. As of 2008 the buildings located on the land purchased by Morris County have been demolished in preparation for building a park. The new park has been named ""Central Park"" in an effort to distance it from the asylum's history.
Ground was ceremonially broken on November 16, 2005, for the new psychiatric hospital on the Greystone campus (behind the Kirkbride). The estimated date of opening was October 2007. However the due to many delays and problem the hospital did not receive patients until July of 2008. The new hospital is two-thirds the size of the Kirkbride building and will house about 450 patients, with another 100 patients living in hospital-run cottages on the grounds around the main building. All clients of Greystone are being transferred from their current buildings, to the new main building of the hospital. A mass move is planned thus housing for clients will be limited to the new main building as well as the cottages on the grounds.[1]
Demolition began on the left wing of the Kirkbride on April 6th 2015, tearing down the end 2-story isolation wards and removing part of the roof of the end 4-story wards. By October demolition had been completed.

2015 update by Antiquity Echoes for their documentary titled Greystone's Last Stand
Antiquity Echoes travels to Weston, WV to visit the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. The people behind this successful historic site were one of many parties interested in rehabilitating the old Greystone asylum in Parsippany, NJ. They, along with all other proposals for reuse were rejected by the state. Time and time again the state of New Jersey has stated that a main factor in the rejection of these plans was that every proposal required state funding of some kind. This is utterly untrue, and here we see proof.

Hagedorn Gero-Psychiatric Hospital  | Hagedorn Psychiatric Hospital,"In 1907, New Jersey opened its only state owned and operated sanatorium in Glen Gardner. It was intended to be a model institution, providing individual and public health benefits to an expected 500 case annually. Described at the time as “largely educational in character, which would give a practical demonstration of up-to-date methods of treating .... tuberculosis”, the facility treated more than 10,000 between 1907 and 1929.
The sanatorium's mission was broadened and the effects of long-term care assessed by the 1920s. The scope was broadened to incorporate cases in all levels of severity, regardless of the original intention to only treat ""incipients, or 'curables'"". The sanatorium's treatment remained reatively unchanged until the middle of the twentieth century when medication became the prevailing treatment. In 1950, the sanatorium broaden it's scope once again, but this to to include all chest diseases, and the name was changed to the New Jersey Hospital for Chest Diseases.
In 1977, the hospital changed its name again to the Senator Garret W. Hagedorn Gero-Psychiatric Hospital as it focused on its new calling as a state nursing home and eventually a 288-bed psychiatric hospital. The hospital’s premier location high up on a mountaintop with 600 acres of provided inpatient, comprehensive psychiatric treatment for adult patients. The hospital stated as its mission “to provide quality interdisciplinary psychiatric services that maximize potential and community reintegration within a safe and caring environment.”
In 2011, New Jersey decided to close the smallest of New Jersey’s four public mental hospitals. Even with a one-year reprieve by New Jersey’s legislature, Governor Chris Christie has targeted Hagedorn as the one to close. Governor Christie explained that by closing Hagedorn New Jersey would save $9 million annually.  It would also result in the closure of Freedom House (a center for treating addiction on the Hagedorn campus). Local residents expressed concern about the future of the 600-acre property.

New Jersey,Marlboro State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Marlboro_State_Hospital,1928,1930,1931,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital,"March 9, 1931, five buildings had been erected to accommodate 500 patients; as of June 30, 1931, a total of six buildings had been completed and four more patient cottages were
60% completed. The buildings were considered fireproof - the floors were of concrete covered by linoleum, and the walls and partitions were made of hollow tile. The Medical Director was
Dr. J. Berkeley Gordon.  It was anticipated that when the buildings under construction were completed, the hospital would accommodate 2,000. In 1931, the hospital received 632 transfer patients, 123 male and 509 female.  It was decided to take in only those patients who were well institutionalized because the hospital did not yet have facilities for hydrotherapy, seclusion, or other means for treating disturbed patients. At the end of the year, the patient population was 1,094.  At the end of the year, the hospital had 1,094 patients, 598 males, 496 females. The reception hospital was completed in November 1932. In February 1933, the nurses' home was completed; construction had begun in the fall of 1931. As of July 9, 1932, two gatehouses were completed and windows and frames on five of six dormitories were being scraped and painted. The cottages which were built to house 99 patients were overcrowded. Women were housed in the hospital and cottages G, H, I, and J. Cottage G was used for the ""untidy"" and ""more deteriorated""; H for those in fair condition who were in industrial therapy, I for the ""colored,"" and J for those whose condition was in between those in cottages G and H. Occupational therapy for men was in the weaving shop - activities were weaving, brush making, basketry, cord knotting, rug hooking and braiding, raveling, and winding - and in the woodworking shop. The women also had two shops.
At the end of 1934, the second full year of direct admissions, the hospital had 1,892 patients in residence, 99 on ""parole,"" 952 men and 940 women. The Medical Director complained of overcrowding.Each of the 10 cottages had a design capacity of 99 patients. At the end of the year, the senile building was in use.  It had opened February 10, 1936; the one for the disturbed was mostly completed. The senile building had dining rooms on the first and second floor and there were plans for a diet kitchen and dining room in the center structure. As of April 3, 1936, the senile building had a fully equipped kitchen and dining room on each floor. Both buildings had electric elevators. In February 1936, the workers provided a temporary phone line from cottage 13 to the new senile building. The disturbed building lacked a tunnel connection as of November 1936.
The women's senile and disturbed buildings opened in July 1939.  Women were moved from two floors of the other senile building and men moved in to replace them. The dining rooms in the new disturbed and senile opened in July. The TB building opened in September. Two WPA projects were not moving forward because of lack of funds -  the two doctors' cottages and a crop keeper for one of the cow barns.
The children's units were ready for occupancy as of December 8, 1939. According to a December 14, 1939 newspaper article, two red brick buildings for ""mentally crippled"" children were to open in several months. They would be the first hospital in New Jersey for ""mentally crippled juveniles."" Pennsylvania and New York already had similar units. The $120,000 cost was from W.P.A. and State monies. The State would use manual instruction instead of reading, writing, and arithmetic. By January 12, 1940, the hospital was at capacity. It had just received the last of 100 transfers from Greystone. As of the end of January 1940, the hospital reported that it had 1,294 men and 1,229 female patients, total 2,423.
In January 1942, it was reported that the hospital was understaffed by 132 employees out of 640. It was also noted that Ft. Monmouth was paying higher wages. The shortage was particularly acute on the men's wards. In that year according to the Medical Director, admissions had leveled off.  At the end of the year, 2,557 patients were in residence.
After more than six decades of the hospital running under state funding, it was shut down after a state investigation, prompted by an undercover operation. On July 1, 1998, the state hospital closed its doors for good. Closing the state hospital came 11 years after State Senator Richard Codey went undercover in the hospital, hired as an orderly. Codey chronicled his experience in New Jersey Monthly magazine, saying he witnessed “inhumane care and treatment of mental patients,” as well as poor living and working conditions. According to the Senate’s executive summary, the Marlboro State Psychiatric Hospital was one of seven state-run psychiatric institutions in New Jersey. In its final years, it served 780 patients per day and employed 1,157. The report cites the the hospital’s 1995 state budget, which was $55.5 million. On Nov. 18, 2011 Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno officially announced it will clean up the property, knock down and clean up 600,000 square feet of buildings, all without costing Marlboro taxpayers money. The Township will purchase the property in 2014, through open space funds, to preserve the large piece of land. As of January 2015, nearly all of the structures have been leveled. The remaining few buildings have been gutted and prepped for the wrecking ball.
There is a patient cemetery on the property with 924 graves, all marked by numbers but one that had been replaced by family members of the deceased.",1998,,,,1931,1998,2000,2557,2557,0
New Jersey,Trenton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Trenton_State_Hospital,"March 25, 1845","November 4, 1845","May 15, 1848",Active,Kirkbride Plan,"John Notman, Charles F. Anderson",New Jersey Lunatic Asylum at Trenton | New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton,"The following is from a 1916 treatise entitled The Institutional Care of the Insane in the United States and Canada. The necessity of erecting an asylum for the care and treatment of the insane was advocated by Dr. Lyndon A. Smith, of Newark, in an address read before the Medical Society of New Jersey in 1837, on the occasion of his taking the chair as president of the society. This was the first appeal for the state to assume its duty to this class of unfortunates. The interest of the medical men being aroused by this address, they made their influence felt in the various communities, which resulted in an appeal being made to the Legislature in 1839. A joint resolution was accordingly passed by the Legislature authorizing the Governor to appoint commissioners to ascertain as accurately as practicable the number, age, sex and condition of lunatics in the state; and if, on such investigation being made, a lunatic asylum should be thought the best remedy for their relief, then to ascertain the necessary cost of the establishment of such an institution, the locality for the same, etc. An appropriation of $500 was made to defray the expenses of the investigation. Governor Pennington appointed as commissioners Doctors Lyndon A. Smith, of Newark; Lewis Condict, of Norristown; A. F. Taylor, of New Brunswick; C. G. McChesney, of Trenton, and L. Q. C. Elmer, Esq., of Cumberland County. The fact that four out of five of the commissioners were medical men, one of whom was Dr. Lyndon A. Smith, who first advocated this public measure when president of the State Medical Society, indicates clearly that the Governor was strongly impressed with the idea that the medical men were the most earnest advocates of the movement.
The commissioners met at the office of Dr. Smith in Newark, and Dr. Condict was appointed chairman. They apportioned among themselves different duties and different portions of the state for investigation. They visited the various counties of the state and made careful personal investigation of all cases of insane persons and the manner in which they were cared for by their friends or in the county institutions.
They also enlisted the aid of intelligent and interested citizens in the different parts of New Jersey. Dr. Condict and Dr. Smith visited the McLean Asylum at Charlestown, MA, the State Lunatic Hospital at Worcester and the General Hospital and the State Penitentiary at Boston, in order to obtain information in regard to the management of these institutions, the cost of maintaining them and the result of this method of custodial care and medical treatment of the insane. The commissioners presented a carefully prepared report to the Legislature of the session of 1840-41 showing the result of their investigation, and stated that there were in New Jersey at that time 338 persons who were actually insane, not counting any doubtful cases, and that many of them were suffering for the want of proper care and treatment.
The Governor in his message the following year recommended the subject to the attention of the Legislature and a joint committee was appointed, who reported in favor of an appropriation for the erection of an asylum, and, in order to enlist the sympathy of the Legislature and urge the necessity of this appropriation, reported some cases of suffering and cruelty which had come under their observation. The commissioners closed the report as follows:
Deeply impressed with the conviction that the time has arrived when New Jersey should act promptly upon this subject, and desirous that she should not be behind her sister states in their philanthropic exertions, your committee unanimously submit for the consideration of the Legislature the following resolutions:
Notwithstanding this report and an urgent appeal of the committee for an appropriation, the Legislature adjourned without having taken any action upon the subject.
During the year 1844 Miss Dorothea Lynde Dix visited all the counties, jails and almshouses in New Jersey in order to ascertain how the insane were kept and cared for. She prepared a memorial for the Legislature, giving a detailed account of the observations she had made and facts collected, to which was added the tabular statement made by the commissioners of 1839. Miss Dix made an urgent appeal to the Legislature to act at once and make the necessary appropriation for the erection of a suitable building for the care and treatment of the insane. She cited a number of cases which came under her personal observation to emphasize the importance of the state assuming its duty to a class of unfortunates which it had up to this time neglected. One of these cases was that of a man who had been an upright and worthy citizen, and who, during his youth and middle age, had been honored by his fellow citizens. He had for many years been a member of the Legislature and his ability as a lawyer had raised him to the bench, where his decisions were marked by clearness and impartiality. This man, who acquired an honest competency for his old age, found it swept away through no fault of his own. In addition to his financial troubles he lost by death an only son, which was more than he could bear. His mind gave way and he became hopelessly insane.
As there was no place where he could be cared for, he was first confined in the county jail, but was afterwards removed to the county almshouse. When Miss Dix visited him he was a feeble old man lying on a small bed in a basement room destitute of necessary comforts. Miss Dix in her appeal said: ""This feeble and depressed old man, a pauper, helpless, lonely, and yet conscious of surrounding circumstances, and not now wholly oblivious of the past—this feeble old man, who was he?"" This was a most urgent appeal for the pauper jurist who was well known to many members of the legislature. This memorial was presented to the Legislature of New Jersey, January 23, 1845, by Joseph S. Dodd in the Senate, who was Miss Dix's supporter and himself an earnest advocate of the measure.
Mr. Dodd's resolution calling for a joint committee of both houses for further consideration of the subject was passed the day following. The first committee made their report February 25, and declared that it was unnecessary for them to occupy further time as they could only repeat what is better said in the memorial of Miss Dix, ""which presents the whole subject in so lucid a manner as to supersede the necessity of any remarks from us."" They then concluded their report with a fervent appeal to the Legislature to act at once in the matter. While the higher-minded members of both houses were genuine converts to the measure and anxious for its adoption, there were a larger number of small politicians secretly opposing it because they were afraid they might lose some votes on account of increased taxation. One of these fellows spoke of this plan as "" An Egyptian Colosseum,"" and declared that a most popular act would be ""to appropriate money sufficient to fill up the cellars and sow them over with grass seed, so that the spot may not be seen hereafter.""
After this setback Miss Dix was up every morning before sunrise, writing letters and editorials. During the session she held frequent interviews with the members and in the evenings as often as possible she would argue a company of 15 or 20 whom were specially invited to her parlor. It was by such arguments with individual members that the measure was carried through. If Miss Dix had not remained on the ground and championed the cause it would have probably failed as it had at previous sessions of the legislature. The act of authorization was taken up March 14, 1845 and read for the last time. The proposition to postpone action till the next session of the legislature was voted down in the Senate and on March 25 the re-engrossed bill passed.
At the close of the session in 1845 the legislature made an appropriation of $10,000 to pay for ground and $25,000 toward the erection of a building. The following commissioners were appointed for selecting a suitable site: Daniel Haines, Thomas A Smith, John L. Condict, Joseph Saunders and Maurice Beesley. After visiting various localities in the state the commissioners determined on the site on which the building now stands. The location was on the bank of the Delaware River, almost two and a half miles northeast of the City Hall. The buildings are constructed of reddish sandstone, obtained from the quarries near the hospital, and are located on an elevation about 75 feet above the river. The commissioners had some difficulty in agreeing upon a site from the many that were offered in the various sections of the state and the selection of the one chosen was determined by a large spring of excellent water near the present building. This spring would provide a daily supply of about 500,000 gallons of pure water for many years. During the summer of 1845 Eli F. Cooley, Calvin Newell, and Samuel Rush were appointed building commissioners by Governor Stratton and were given the responsibility of constructing the new hospital building. They visited various institutions in other states and examined a number of plans. They finally decided upon the design by Dr. Thomas S. Kirkbride who was superintendent of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane at Philadelphia.
Architect John Notman was selected to make some changes in the plans and oversee the erection of the building. The work was done by William Phillips and Joseph NVhitaker, builders of the old New Jersey State House. Construction of the new hospital commenced on November 4, 1845 but the work was delayed due to the lack of necessary appropriations. The hospital finally opened for the reception of patients on May 15, 1848. The main building which was the first erected following the plans of Dr. Thomas Kirkbride consisted of physician apartments, officer quarters, offices, a chapel, kitchens, and six wards for male, and six for female patients. Total accommodations for about 200 patients. The plan was such that additions could be made to the building for the accommodation of more patients when required.
The various appropriations of money up to the time the building was opened for the reception of patients amounted to $153,861.90, which included the original cost of the farm, the erection and furnishing of the building, grading and improving of grounds, stock for farm and all necessary expenditures.
An act to provide for the organization of the State Lunatic Asylum and for the care and maintenance of the insane was passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor February 28, 1847. This act provided for the appointment of ten managers, and invested the power of filling vacancies in the Supreme Court of the state. This board was authorized to elect a medical superintendent, a treasurer, steward and matron. The salaries of the officers were to be approved by the Governor and paid from the State Treasury. Patients were to be admitted to the asylum in due proportion from each county, by the court or any judge of the Common Pleas; it was made the duty of the overseers of the poor to make application to any judge, in case of an insane pauper, for authority to commit such pauper to the asylum; it was also made a duty of said judge to summon at least two respectable physicians and to investigate the case; and if the person examined was found to be a suitable patient for the asylum he was to be removed to and retained there at the expense of the county to which he belonged. No patient was to be admitted for a shorter period than six months. The managers were to receive no compensation, their traveling expenses only being allowed them. All purchases for the asylum were to be made for cash, and the managers were bound to make all needful rules to enforce this provision. At a meeting of the Board of Managers held in the spring of 1847 they appointed Dr. Horace A. Buttolph medical superintendent. He had for some years been an assistant of Dr. Brigham at the State Insane Asylum at Utica, N. Y., and had visited some of the institutions for the insane in England and other countries. They appointed Caleb Sager, a business man from Mount Holly, steward. Subsequent events proved that the managers made no mistakes in these appointments. Dr. Buttolph was a master of details, a great organizer, a good disciplinarian, well posted in his specialty and was highly respected by the medical profession, being an honorary member of the State Society. Mr. Sager was an exceptionally good business manager, as was evidenced by his being one of the organizers and the first president of the First National Bank of Trenton. Under the management of Dr. Buttolph the buildings were improved and enlarged from time to time and new ones were erected to meet the requirements of the increasing population according to the finances of the institution or the appropriations from the legislature. The grounds in front of the main building were laid out, graded and planted with trees, shrubbery, evergreens and flowering plants under the direction of A. J. Downing, a landscape gardener.
Two wings were added to the main building in 1855. New additions were estimated to afford easy accommodation for 250 additional patients and their attendants. The Randolph museum and reading room was erected the same year. This structure, built of brown stone in the octagon form, was 32 feet in diameter, surrounded by a wide portico and lighted from the top. The interior was in one room with octagon sides and ceiling, fitted with cases for containing curios and interesting objects, furnished with tables for books, pamphlets, papers, games, etc. Stewart F. Randolph, of New York, made the liberal donation of $3300 for the erection of the Randolph museum and he and his brother contributed more than $300 in money and engravings for the furnishing of the museum; other friends of the institution also contributed liberally. Morris, Tasker & Morris, of Philadelphia, gave a ""self-regulating hot water furnace"" for warming the museum and reading room, the listed price of which was $675.
An exercise room, 20 by 60 feet in extent, for the use of female patients and also a ten-pin alley for the men were built adjoining the airing courts of the convalescent patients. The exercise room was erected and furnished by the contributions of various benevolent individuals at a cost of more than $1700.
During the year 1856 the steam boilers used for heating the house and other purposes were removed from beneath the central building and placed in a newly erected steam boiler house, for which a special appropriation of $6000 had been made by the Legislature.
During the year 1858 a new building for a laundry was erected and supplied with improved fixtures and machinery. Several new billiard tables were purchased and those intended for the men were placed on the convalescent wards and the one for the women in the new exercise room. The medical superintendent stated ""that he thought this game to be among the most useful for insane patients, by supplying healthful exercise to the body and limbs and thoroughly arousing and concentrating the attention of the mental faculties of many spectators, as well as those directly engaged in it."" Also that year a system of forced ventilation similar to that in use at the Utica, Worcester, Northampton, and Taunton asylums was introduced. A large fan was set up in a room adjoining the boiler house which was run by a small Corliss engine so as to force fresh air through the warm air chambers and flues into every part of the building and foul air through the ventilating openings and flues outwards.
In 1863 an extension to the center of the main building was made and completed by a legislative appropriation. It was built of brown sandstone to correspond with the rest of the structure, 40 by 65 feet in extent and three stories high, with half octagon projection in front. A part of the lower story was used for store rooms and a part was added to the kitchen. The second story was devoted to offices and reception rooms. The upper story was converted into a chapel with a seating capacity for about 300 persons. It was furnished with a pipe organ, purchased by a bequest of a friend of the institution, Mrs. Elizabeth Dale Reade, of Philadelphia. In 1864 the bakery was greatly improved and enlarged and an apparatus for making aerated bread was installed. In 1866 two wings, one for men and the other for women, were added to the building. It was estimated that these additions would accommodate about 200 additional patients and their attendants. The appropriations for these buildings, with lighting, heating, drainage, plumbing and furnishing, amounted to about $135,000.
As the number of insane had greatly increased in the state and this institution was overcrowded, the Legislature of 1871 appointed a commission to select a suitable site and build a hospital in the northern part of the state. The present location near Morris Plains was chosen and work on the buildings commenced. Dr. Buttolph, who was a member of the commission, took a great interest in aiding the architect in preparing the plans for the building and seeing that all the specifications were carried out, and in order to do this had to spend considerable time at the institution. He was elected superintendent to open and organize the new institution and assumed the duties of his office April 1, 1876.
Dr. John W. Ward, who had been a member of the medical staff since May, 1867, and for the three preceding years first assistant physician, was appointed medical superintendent to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. Buttolph. Dr. John Kirby was chosen as first assistant physician to fill the vacancy created by Dr. Ward's promotion and Dr. Charles P. Britton was chosen for the position of second assistant physician in place of Dr. Macdonald, who had been appointed to a similar position in the Morristown Asylum. In accordance with the law authorizing a division of the state to be made by the Board of Managers of the Trenton Asylum and the Commissioners of the Morristown Asylum, and to be sanctioned by the Governor, the division was made and approved July 26, 1876. This division assigned to the Morristown Asylum the counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, Union and Warren. Under this arrangement 292 patients—139 men and 153 women—were removed from the care of this institution during the month of August to the asylum at Morristown. After the removal of these patients on October 31, 1876 there remained 251 men and 221 women for a total number of 472 inmates.
The institution again became overcrowded and the Board of Managers asked the Legislature for an appropriation for the erection of a building to afford additional accommodation for the patients. In 1887 the Legislature passed an act appropriating $100,000 for this purpose. The plans were drawn by Charles F. Anderson, an architect of Trenton, assisted by Dr. Ward, who made suggestions in regard to the style and general arrangement of the building. It is a handsome structure of red sandstone, three stories in height and capable of accommodating 300 patients. This building was intended for the chronic or incurable class and was opened for the reception of patients in October, 1889.
The state asylums at Trenton and Morristown had their own Boards of Managers until the legislature passed an act, approved March 17, 1891, abolishing their boards and appointing a single board of seven members in their place to perform their duties. This board was organized at Trenton on Monday, March 19, 1891, with James N. Pidcock, of Hunterdon County, as president. The board at this meeting reappointed the medical superintendent and all of the assistant physicians. At a subsequent meeting Edmund White resigned his position as steward and William H. Earley, of Trenton, was appointed in his place. One of the first acts of this Board of Managers was to order the erection of a stone building, a part of which was to be used for cold storage and a part for the manufacture of artificial ice in sufficient amount to supply the hospital. This supplied a much-needed want and has up to the present time met all necessary requirements.
By an act of the legislature which was approved March 11, 1893, the title of ""The State Asylum for the Insane at Morristown "" was changed to the title of "" The New Jersey State Hospital at Morris Plains,"" and the title of ""The New Jersey State Lunatic Asylum "" was changed to the title of "" The New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton."" The management was changed to correspond with that of Morris Plains. The administration was divided into a medical and a business department. The medical director was "" to have charge, direction and control of all patients and of all persons engaged in the care of patients."" The warden was to be "" general manager of the buildings, grounds, farms and to make all purchases for the hospital and patients."" Under this act John W. Ward, M. D., was appointed medical director, and William H. Earley warden.
In the month of November, 1893, two additions to the main building, each containing congregate dining rooms, were completed and opened for use at a cost of about $50,000. The additions are of stone and correspond in their general structure with the building of which they now form a part of. They are three stories high, 40 feet wide and 172 feet in length. There are three dining rooms for the men and three for the women, which are connected with the upper, middle and lower floors of the hospital by enclosed corridors. The better class of patients, including the convalescents, take their meals in the upper dining rooms, those more excited in the middle and the worst class in the lower dining rooms. By this arrangement neither of the three classes of patients comes into contact with any other at meal time and the greatest objection to congregate dining rooms is thus avoided. This plan has proved to be very satisfactory in this hospital.
During the year 1896 a modern laboratory building of pressed brick was erected and equipped for scientific work. Two additional green-houses were built, as the one in use up to this time were not large enough to meet the requirements of the hospital. In 1897 the Legislature created ""two asylum districts"" within this state, returning the management of each state hospital to a separate board as it had been up to the year 1891. In accordance with this act the Board of Managers of the New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton was organized on June 20, 1897. G. D. W. Vroom, of Trenton, who for several years had been a member of the previous board, and who also had been a member of the board which had been abolished in 1891, was elected president and continued to serve in this position until the time of his death, which occurred March 4, 1914. Mr. Vroom took a great interest in everything connected with the hospital and for many years gave his valuable time and services gratuitously to what he considered a great public charity.
In 1897 extensive improvements and additions which had been in progress during the two previous years were completed and paid for from the accumulated earnings of the hospital. These improvements consisted of a residence for the medical director, a new water supply, including a standpipe with a capacity for over 500,000 gallons, macadamized roads, a complete system of drainage, the laying out and grading of the grounds in front of the annex and around the medical director's residence, and the planting of trees, plants and shrubbery on what is now considered the most attractive part of the grounds around the institution. The medical director's house was built of pressed vitrified brick. It is of good size and the rooms are finished in hard wood, large, airy and comfortable. The standpipe is large enough to supply the wants of the institution and is so connected with the different buildings as to be of great service in case of fire. The water, which is of excellent quality, is supplied from six artesian wells and pumped into the standpipe by hydraulic pumps. During the year the laundry was improved by changes in the building and machinery, at a cost of $6000.
An extension to the center of the main building was also completed and furnished. It was built of brown stone and corresponds in structure with the rest of the building of which it now forms a part. The first floor was used for a large store-room for all kinds of clothing for the hospital. The second floor was furnished for offices; one side of the wide hall was to be used by the warden for his private office and the other rooms for his assistants. On the other side of the hall there was a private office for the medical director, a room for the stenographers which more recently has also been fitted up with steel cases for the keeping of the records of cases and one for the medical library which was started at that time, but has been greatly improved by the addition of new standard works on medicine in recent years. The third floor was fitted up for a chapel. It was furnished with quartered-oak seats, handsome stained glass windows, was carpeted, and has a seating capacity for about 500 persons. The pipe organ which had been in the old chapel was taken apart, thoroughly renovated and was set up in the new chapel. The old chapel was repainted, furnished with a metal ceiling and turned into an amusement hall for entertainments, such as dances, stereopticon lectures, theatrical performances and concerts by the hospital orchestra.
The old amusement hall was thoroughly renovated, furnished with chairs; tables and new book cases were built around the room. It was converted into a library, to which the books which had been kept in book cases on the convalescent wards were transferred. Anne Robinson, who for many years had been an attendant and nurse in this hospital, died and left by will the savings of a lifetime, which amounted to $5000, the interest of which was to be used by the chief executive medical officer "" for the purchase of books and for no other purpose, to be used for the pleasure and benefit of those to whom she had for so many years endeavored to minister."" The Anne Robinson Library now contains over 4000 volumes, with a librarian in daily attendance. It is doubtful if any other hospital for the insane in this country has so large a library for the use of the patients and employees.
During the year 1900 the warden's residence was completed, furnished and occupied by the warden and his family. The house is a handsome brick structure situated near the main entrance from the road to the hospital grounds. A dormitory for the accommodation of women attendants and nurses was also completed, furnished and ready for occupancy. It is a handsome building of Stockton brown stone, three stories high and contains 60 sleeping rooms, with ample bath, toilet and wash rooms on each floor, and suitable reception and reading rooms. The building is conveniently situated between the main building and the annex. The cost of this building and furnishings was in excess of $22,000. In 1901 the wiring of the several buildings of the hospital for electricity and the erection of a suitable number of arc lights on the grounds were completed and electric lighting put in operation. This improvement involved an expenditure of $15,000. The Public Service Corporation furnishes the electric current by contract.
The first class of the training school for nurses was graduated June 2, 1904, when diplomas were conferred on 8 men and 14 women who had successfully passed their examinations in May. The course of training has been improved and widened in recent years by lessons in practical nursing and each nurse being obliged to have several months' experience in Mercer Hospital before graduation.
In 1905 by an act of the Legislature the sum of $12,500 was appropriated for the construction of fire escapes. Thirteen Kirker-Bender fire escapes were erected at the most suitable points of exit from the main building and annex. An appropriation of $250,000 was made for the erection of two additional wings at the ""annex"" which was intended to accommodate 400 more patients and their attendants. These additions were completed, furnished and opened for the reception of patients in February, 1907.
Dr. John W. Ward was an assistant physician at this institution from May, 1867, until he succeeded Dr. Buttolph as medical superintendent April 1, 1876. He continued in this position until 1893, when the title of the office was changed to that of medical director, in which capacity he served until July, 1907, when he retired to private life, after more than 40 years of continuous service. It is doubtful if any physician has ever been connected for so long a time with a state institution for the care of the insane in this country in an official capacity. Dr. Ward was a man of unusual ability, in his day a good executive officer, who had many friends among the public men and physicians of the state. He served as president of the State Society for the term 1887-1888.
William P. Hayes resigned the office of warden and was succeeded by Samuel T. Atchley, of Mercer County, September 1, 1907. On October 18 Henry A. Cotton, M. D., of the Hospital for the Insane, Danvers, Mass., was appointed medical director.
Dr. Cotton entered upon his duties as medical director in November, and at once proceeded to organize the medical department along the lines of progressive, up-to-date hospitals for the insane. He adopted the method of examination outlined by Dr. Adolf Meyer for the New York State hospitals. The records of cases, instead of being kept in the old style case books, are put in separate envelopes and filed in cabinets for reference. All the changes in the conditions of patients are noted by the physicians under whose care they may be, who make notes, which are typewritten along with the histories of the case of which they form a part and are available as records for the hospital. Staff meetings were instituted and held every day. At these meetings the members of the staff report anything that is unusual or sufficiently important in the part of the hospital in which they may be on duty. Each physician receives the cases when admitted in rotation and finds out all the history of each case possible and then makes a physical and mental examination, a synopsis of which he reads in the staff meeting. The case is then presented for observation, discussion and diagnosis. A stenographic report is kept as a permanent record of these discussions, which are really clinics of mental and nervous diseases. The staff meetings enable the medical director to keep himself well informed about what is occurring in the hospital as well as to supervise the work of his assistant physicians and to see and examine each new patient soon after admission to the hospital. It is a valuable school of instruction for new members of the staff, who at once realize its advantage. The patients themselves are usually anxious to appear before the whole staff and make known their real or imaginary troubles. They think their cases are receiving more consideration and that they will more likely get justice.
The change in the manner of receiving new cases and the new methods of medical work rendered the quota of physicians too small, so that it was necessary to increase the staff, and a woman physician was included among the number to care especially for a certain class of female patients. A consulting staff, composed of the prominent physicians and surgeons of Trenton, was appointed in order that the best medical and surgical advice might be had in special cases. One of the most important changes made by Dr. Cotton was the abolition of all forms of mechanical restraint. This was accomplished in a period of less than three months without any very great inconvenience and added much to the comfort of the excited class of patients. All restraint apparatus, including chairs, jackets, muffs, etc., was entirely removed from the wards and there has been no restraint employed in the hospital up to this time.
Dormitories for the reception of new patients were established in both the male and female departments. All new cases are received in these dormitories, where they are kept in bed for a time while they are under observation, or so long as their condition renders it necessary and they require special care and treatment. Sick or infirmary wards for old and feeble cases were established in the annex. The patients in these dormitories are kept in bed when necessary and are under the constant care of competent nurses, day and night, thereby avoiding accidents or any just cause for complaint. Patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis were isolated and placed in special dormitories as far as possible. A modern, up-to-date operating room was installed as well as a sterilizing room and bath room. The rooms have tiled walls and floors, with modern sanitary arrangements. An anaesthetizing room and a ward for post-operative cases are included in this department. The cost of fitting up these rooms for apparatus, instruments, tiling, plumbing, etc., was $2500.
Special attention was paid to the laboratory and the number of autopsies greatly increased over the years. In 1908 a number of changes were made in the fixtures and interior arrangement of the building in order to accommodate a greater number of workers and the installation of new testing apparatus. The installation of a telephone exchange with 82 local stations proved to be of inestimable benefit to the institution. A watchman's clock was installed, with stations on each ward, so that accurate information of night nurses and attendants could be obtained. The fire apparatus on the wards was overhauled and new fire mains and plugs were placed around the grounds and buildings in order to afford more ample fire protection. The old machinery in the bakery building was removed and new machinery and ovens installed at a cost of $5000. In 1909 continuous baths were installed. They consisted of four tubs in the female department and eight tubs each in the male department. Also this year the tuberculosis building for male patients was completed and occupied. There were also a number of changes made in the rooms and wards of the hospital. The wards were remodeled and painted and in many instances rooms were torn out and alcoves made, thereby allowing more air and sun-light to reach the wards.
During the year 1910 many of the strong rooms were torn out and the space turned into sitting rooms. The $3000 appropriated for furniture for the wards was judiciously expended and they were made more homelike and comfortable. The Legislature appropriated $2000 to make day spaces or sitting rooms on several of the wards. Sixteen strong rooms were abolished on the women's side of the house and the space turned into sitting rooms. This included six rooms on Ward 9, on which were confined the worst class of women patients in the hospital. It was formerly thought necessary to have these patients sleeping in "" strong rooms,"" with guarded windows and double doors, but since the rooms have been removed they have not been missed. The appropriation of $17,000 for renewing the plumbing in the annex was expended and the sanitary conditions of the building thereby greatly improved. The Legislature of 1910 made an appropriation of $3000 for remodeling the wards and this money was spent in tearing out rooms, making open spaces and more day spaces on the wards in order to admit more light and air. Owing to this appropriation the same improvements were made in the male department corresponding to those which had been made in the female department. A fireproof steel filing cabinet, for which money was appropriated, was installed for keeping records.
Two thousand dollars appropriated for furniture for the wards was expended and used to advantage on the men's side of the hospital. During the hospital year terminating November 1, 1910, there were 100 state hospital autopsies, 20 autopsies in the general hospitals and 1545 bacteriological, histological and clinical examinations. These autopsies represent a ratio of almost 75 per cent of the total number of deaths within the year. The autopsies obtained in 1908 were 62 per cent and in 1909 73 per cent. Through the efforts of the medical director the Legislature in 1911 passed a voluntary commitment act. During the year 21 men and 6 women availed themselves of the opportunity to come voluntarily for treatment. Many of these patients were in the early stages of their mental trouble and at a period when they were more amenable to treatment, thereby increasing their chances for recovery. A regular course of lectures and special instruction in practical nursing was given to the members of the nurses' training school during the year. As a consequence there is a marked improvement in the nursing of the patients in the sick dormitories. At the annual commencement of the training school, held June 7, 1911, two men and nine women received diplomas.
The Legislature of 1911 appropriated $3000 for remodeling the wards. The money was spent in tearing out rooms, making open spaces and more day spaces on the wards where very little light and air penetrated before. These improvements were made in the male department corresponding with those made in the female department a year previous. One thousand five hundred dollars was appropriated for completing the plumbing of the annex, and the hospital now throughout may be classed with the best in the country in regard to its sanitary, hygienic and bathing facilities. Two thousand dollars appropriated for furniture for the wards was expended for the men's side of the house. During the summer of 1911 a room was fitted up and furnished with all the necessary apparatus and equipment for a dental office. The tuberculosis building for female patients, for which $3000 was appropriated, was completed and occupied. It is able to accommodate from 25 to 30 patients if necessary.
The hospital had on October 31, 1911, in its possession accurate and complete histories of nearly 1800 cases. There was issued during the year the first volume of collected papers written by members of the medical staff, consisting of 14 original articles. An out-patient department was established in 1911 in connection with the Mercer Hospital in the City of Trenton. The out-patient department is so organized that the medical director spends one morning a week at Mercer Hospital, to which indigent patients suffering from nervous and mental diseases can go for the necessary advice and consultation without any cost to the patients themselves.
The Legislature of 1911 appropriated $2800 for field work and the hospital at present has two trained women engaged in this special work. These field workers go into the families and communities of patients admitted to this hospital and learn the facts regarding heredity, environment, domestic relations, and causes of mental diseases. They also carry with them a list of the names of the discharged patients when they visit a certain community and ascertain all the facts obtainable concerning these discharged patients, such as their mental and physical condition, their environment, and detailed accounts of their investigations are made in writing when they return to the hospital. These reports not only enable the medical director to keep in touch with discharged patients and know whether they recover or relapse, but the families, through the visitations of the field workers, are able to keep in communication with the hospital and obtain the necessary advice concerning their friends or relatives who have been discharged.
The Legislature of 1911 appropriated money to purchase 254 acres of farm land in the vicinity of the hospital for the purpose of producing milk and raising vegetables for the needs of the institution. A large new laundry sufficient to meet the requirements of the institution has been completed and is in operation. The installation of modern machinery and the increase in the amount of room have greatly improved this important work of the institution.
On October 31, 1912 the hospital had a total of 1451 patients— 742 men and 709 women. During the year 488 patients were admitted—282 men and 206 women. In addition to these two men who escaped were returned, and adding the 11 patients nominally admitted for discharge at the end of their four-months' visit, the number of admissions would be 501, making the total number under care 1952.
During 1912 Dr. Turner, ophthalmologist, visited the hospital weekly and not only examined the eyes of all new patients, but thoroughly examined the eyes of many of the old patients with special reference to organic brain disease and dementia praecox. The care of the patients' teeth having proved so beneficial, it was decided by the managers of the hospital to employ a resident dentist who could devote all of his time to the work. In order to bring the physicians in closer touch with the hospital, the custom has been established of inviting the various county medical societies to hold one of their monthly meetings at the hospital during the year. The counties of Somerset, Middlesex, Burlington and Gloucester accepted the invitation and the attendance at these meetings was exceptionally good. Usually a whole day was devoted to their meetings. The hospital was inspected and cases having different forms of mental disease presented and symptoms explained.
The micro-photographic apparatus, obtained by a special appropriation, was installed in temporary quarters and special work in colored micro-photography, the first undertaken in this country, was conducted. Five thousand dollars appropriated for screening the windows was expended, and the hospital equipped with permanent copper screens. Fifteen hundred dollars appropriated for new furniture was also expended. Five thousand dollars was appropriated during the year for the overhauling of the heating system in the main building.
Special attention was paid to the occupation and amusement of patients. The attendants orchestra affords the patients much pleasure by furnishing daily concerts on the lawn during the summer season and in the chapel during the winter months. Many of the men patients among the chronic cases work on the farm or around the buildings. A welfare worker spends her time among the women patients, reading to the patients, playing games and taking them out for walks and does all she can to keep them from brooding over their mental troubles. A woman in charge of the choir drills the patients in chorus work and also arranges for amateur theatricals, in which the nurses and patients take part. A teacher of dancing from Trenton conducts two classes a week for the patients.
On October 31, 1913, there were 1547 patients—781 men and 766 women. During the year 488 patients were admitted—280 men and 208 women—making the total number under care during the year 2035. There were 496 dismissed during the year—274 men and 222 women—leaving the total number of patients under care November 1, 1914, 1539—787 men and 752 women.
A physician who is a psychologist was appointed in 1912 as a research worker, more especially to work up a complete history of alcoholic patients, of their constitutional make-up, heredity, and environment. Dr. Frederick S. Hammond, pathologist, was granted a leave of absence for a year in order to visit the psychiatric clinic at Munich. Dr. Edgar B. Funkhouser was granted a leave of absence for six months, which time he spent in psychiatric clinics of Munich, Vienna and Zurich.
Owing to the number of requests made by the members of the medical profession in Trenton and the vicinity for a post-graduate course of nervous and mental diseases at the State Hospital, it was decided to give such a course during the month of July, 1912. A number of physicians in the vicinity responded to the invitation and the clinics were well attended. The course was intended to give a practical outline of the fundamental principles of nervous and mental diseases, both from a clinical and pathological standpoint. The course was given without charge to the physicians and the members of the staff who gave the lectures felt amply repaid by the attendance and the interest manifested.
The annual commencement of the training school was held on the third Friday in June. Dr. William L. Russell, superintendent of the Bloomingdale Hospital, White Plains, N. Y., delivered the address and the president of the Board of Managers presented diplomas to eight women graduates. The majority of these nurses went to New York hospitals, where they continued their work as post graduate nurses. The scope of the training school for nurses has been enlarged and a three-years' course inaugurated, of which two years and a half will be spent in this hospital and each nurse will spend six months in Mercer Hospital in the City of Trenton before her graduation. Through this arrangement the graduates of the training school will be able to qualify as registered nurses.
An appropriation of $10,000 received from the Legislature for a new laboratory was found to be too small to erect an entirely new building, and it was decided to add to the hospital laboratory a building 70 by 40 feet, which will afford ample accommodations for the increasing amount of work. An X-ray apparatus, for which $2000 was appropriated by the Legislature, has been purchased and installed. The Legislature made in appropriation of $50,000 for a central power plant, which is intended to meet the requirements of the whole institution. The Legislature appropriated $15,000 for the purpose of building two cow stables, a dairy house and three silos.
For years the criminal insane of the State of New Jersey have been confined in the two state institutions, Morris Plains and Trenton, and for at least 25 years the authorities of these two institutions annually petitioned the Legislature for a separate institution to take care of the criminal and convict insane, but without result. The Board of Managers of Trenton finally decided to ask for an appropriation for a suitable building to be erected on the grounds of the New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton which would be large enough to accommodate the criminal and convict insane from both state hospitals. This seemed to be the easiest solution of the problem and in 1913 the Legislature appropriated $150,000 for the construction of the center and one wing of a detention building for the criminal insane. Fifty thousand dollars of this was later diverted towards a central power plant and the money re-appropriated by the succeeding Legislature. One wing and the center building are now under construction and when this unit is completed the building can be occupied. The Legislature of 1915 appropriated $85,000 to complete the central power plant, which equipment was necessary to occupy the criminal insane building.
In 1914 $60,000 was appropriated for a psychopathic building for the female department. The plans and specifications having been drawn, the construction will be begun this summer (1915). The building will be a modern fireproof structure. The first floor will contain the doctors' offices, reception rooms, occupation rooms, and hydrotherapeutic equipment. The second and third floors will consist of private rooms or dormitories and day rooms. The fourth floor will provide an operative department with a fully equipped room for post-operative cases. There will also be a roof garden in order to obtain the maximum fresh air treatment. The dormitories and day rooms will be connected by sliding doors to large porticos in order to give the patients the benefit of as much outdoor treatment as possible. A similar building is planned for the male department.
The amount of money spent in remodeling the building, the new equipment, farm lands, dairy barns, etc., is about $850,000 in the last eight years. In order to completely modernize the hospital a new psychopathic building for the male department, a home for the male attendants and a congregate dining room for the annex are needed. About $250,000 will be required before the board will feel satisfied that the hospital is fulfilling its duty to the community in the care and treatment of the mentally afflicted.
The managers have adopted a very progressive and enlightened policy regarding the institution and exhibit a personal interest in the advancement of the hospital work. For many years the president of the board was Garrett D. W. Vroom, of Trenton, who devoted considerable time to the management of the hospital and exhibited a progressive spirit and hearty cooperation in the attempts of the medical director and warden to improve conditions existing at the time of their appointment in 1907. His time was given willingly and his counsel and advice were an immense benefit to the hospital and those engaged in the duty of reorganization. Too much credit cannot be given to him individually for his influence in the board and his practical, modern policies in all matters connected with the institution. He lived to see the institution changed from an asylum to a modern hospital, but unfortunately he did not live to see all his plans carried out, and his death on March 4, 1914, was a tremendous loss to the institution and officers connected with it.
Dr. Luther M. Halsey succeeded him as president of the Board of Managers, as he was the oldest member of the board and the only surviving member of those who were on the board when the reorganization took place in 1907, having become a member of the board in 1906. It was through the active interest of Dr. Halsey that a complete reorganization of the hospital was possible at that tune. He, with Judge Vroom, made a careful study of the situation and decided that only by adopting the newer methods and obtaining men familiar with such methods would they be able to carry out the plans of reorganization. Dr. Halsey has always taken a most active interest in the management of the hospital and has devoted a great deal of his time to his duties as manager, and it is to him that the largest part of the credit for the present situation is due.
The present Board of Managers consists of five physicians and three business men. It is a harmonious and well-balanced board, who fully realize that the greatest function of the hospital is the care and treatment of the patients and that every other interest must be subservient to this one. The medical men on the board who have contributed much to the improved conditions and who manifest the greatest interest in the welfare of the hospital are Dr. Stewart Paton, of Princeton; Dr. Joseph Raycroft, physical director of Princeton University; Dr. George T. Tracey, of Beverly, N. J., and Dr. Alfred L. Ellis, of Metuchen, N. J. The other members of the board are men of wide business experience, who are intensely interested in the welfare of the hospital and include Arthur D. Forst, of Trenton, N. J.; William L. Black of Hammondtown, N. J., and Joseph L. Moore, of Hopewell, N. J.
Aside from the monthly meetings, which are always well attended, hardly a week goes by that the hospital is not visited by members of the Medical Committee or of the House and Grounds Committee. The board not only maintains a close supervision over the best interests of the hospital, but the medical and scientific work also receives its closest attention, and fortunately politics have as yet had no influence in the selection of the managers or the work in the hospital.[1]
Over the years, new treatments such as hydrotherapy, occupational therapy, heavy metal therapy, insulin, and metazol became available. In 1940 ECT and in 1947 psycho-surgery became available. Trenton Psychiatric Hospital also continued to expand its training program from nursing to social work, occupational therapy, and psychiatric residency.
The development of tranquilizing drugs in the mid-1950s brought about important changes in the hospital treatment programs. Under proper medication, many patients who had been hospitalized for years were able to return to the community, while others became more amenable to psychotherapy and other treatment methods. For the first time in 100 years, the doors of many wards were unlocked, giving patients a degree of freedom in keeping with their progress toward recovery.
The remarkable success of the comprehensive program of services that has evolved is measured by a significant reduction in patient population. On June 1, 1954, 4,237 persons were hospitalized at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. In 1968, 14 years later, there were under 2,800 patients in residence (this reduction occurring in the face of an ever-increasing admission rate), and today the hospital has a capacity of 376 beds. The various names given to the hospital over the years define its changing role. In 1848, it was the New Jersey State Lunatic Asylum. In 1893, the name was changed to New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton. In 1971, it received its current name, Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. Overcrowded, understaffed, and without public support, both moral and financial, Trenton Psychiatric Hospital was for years little more than a custodial institution. But as more modern treatment methods were devised and community supports and services for rehabilitated patients were put in place, the hospital became part of a therapeutic community.

New Jersey,Princeton State Village for Epileptics,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Princeton_State_Village_for_Epileptics,1898,,1899,Demolished,Cottage Plan,Charles W. Leavitt,Skillman Village for Epileptics | New Jersey Village for Epileptics | New Jersey Neuro-Psychiatric Institute | North Princeton Developmental Center,"Opened in 1898, when Acting Gov. Foster M. Voorhees signed a bill into law establishing the State Village for Epileptics. The village was designed to be a self-sustaining agrarian community, where epileptics could live together in a wholesome environment, learn trades, receive medical treatment, and leave behind the almshouses, insane asylums and even prisons to which they had been consigned in the past. Built on farmland bought by the state, the sprawling grounds included a farm with chickens, cows and pigs; fields for growing fruits and vegetables; a power plant; a firehouse; and even a sprawling theater where the residents staged operettas like ""The Pirates of Penzance.""
The village was considered a model of progressive treatment for epileptics in its early years. Through the Great Depression and World War II, however, the institution suffered from cutbacks, understaffing and overcrowding, so much that the press dubbed it ""the snake pit of New Jersey."" As the village deteriorated, however, new drugs were being invented - notably Dilantin, Luminal and Mesantoin - that helped control seizures, making the institution obsolete by the early 1950's. Many of the epileptics were reintegrated with their communities, and in 1953 the village was transformed into the New Jersey Neuro-Psychiatric Institute, a research and treatment center focusing on alcoholics, drug addicts, emotionally disturbed children and people with cerebral palsy.
The institution's final chapter began in 1983. Renamed the North Princeton Developmental Center, it narrowed in scope to treat developmental disabilities, cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders. In 1995, Gov. Christie Whitman declared the site surplus property. The last of the patients were transferred to other facilities and, in 1998, the center closed for good.
For years there were over 100 buildings on the Property, mostly in substandard, unsafe, unsanitary, dilapidated and/or obsolescent condition. Ninety-two of these buildings were abated and demolished summer 2007. The remaining handful of buildings have been boarded up in anticipation of possible reuse as part of redevelopment. Efforts are ongoing to remediate environmental conditions at the site and repair or demolish the dam and restore the lake. The property’s environmental contamination must be remediated and brought into compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Over 600 patients are buried in 2 separate cemeteries on the property. Upper Cemetery was used from 1904 to December 1960 (about 467 interments). Lower Cemetery was used from December 1960 to June 1990 (210 interments, 174 Christian and 36 Jewish).",1998,,,,1898,1998,,,,0

In fact, New Lisbon’s first name was: The Burlington County Colony of The Training School at Vineland. In 1916, with about fifty residents, the Colony became a state institution. New Jersey’s state emblem was added to its sign and it was given a new name: The New Jersey State Colony for Boys (though it was sometimes referred to as the State Colony for Feeble-Minded Males at New Lisbon).  The state determined that private contributions from county citizens could not sufficiently fund the institution. Thus, a board of  managers was appointed and the first annual appropriation was $25,000—a considerable sum at that time.
As for the residents, the children who had originally been transferred from Vineland were more emotionally deficient than mentally ill. The founders thought this kind of child could readily be exploited and molded to the ideals of a new concept; they were right.  Over time, the Colony started accepting boys with a multiplicity of mental illnesses and deficiencies. When state  funding made it feasible they also took in the community’s most deranged boys, some of whom were just short of being legally dangerous.
By 1926 New Lisbon was recognized as a “training center,” and by World War II it housed nearly 800. When I was sent there in 1951, the population had grown to 900 and many resident cottages were uncomfortably overcrowded. At that time, many shades of abuse and neglect had escalated to unfathomable levels, and continue into the 21st Century with no letup in sight. NLDC was originally an offshoot of the Vineland State School and was called, variously, ""Four Mile Colony"" and the ""Colony for Boys"", and later ""New Lisbon State School"" before taking its present name in the early 90's. Today, New Lisbon houses approximately 500 residence, and receives 76 million dollars in state and federal funding per year.
This cemetery was established in 1915. In almost all cases, the persons buried here were former patients of NLDC.

The clients then consisted of females who had moderate developmental disabilities. Programming and activities for the clients was geared to the basic necessities of daily living. As years passed, public awareness grew and began to positively affect the future course of programming for the intellectually challenged. The patients, who are now both male and female, were helped to lead more productive and satisfying lives.
During the 1980's, the facility was renamed the North Jersey Developmental Center to properly reflect the change in services and programs which were based on the philosophy of normalization. The basic premise being that developmentally disabled persons be provided the most normal environment possible where they develop life skills to the greatest possible extent. In 2012 it was announced that 2 of the states developmental centers were to be shuttered for good. The North Jersey Developmental Center officially closed in 2014. The buildings were immediately boarded up with plywood, and a private security company was hired. The site sat idle for a few years, but in December of 2017 the state allowed the sale of the property to go through. It was sold for $1 to the boro of Totowa, who then sold it for five million dollars to a developer.

It was founded in 1886 by an African Methodist Episcopal Minister, the Reverend W. A. Rice, in an effort to introduced the vocational education concepts of Booker T. Washington. Sometimes celebrated as the ""Tuskegee of the North,"" The Bordentown School graduated approximately 100 students a year. The school focused on vocational trade training and academic studies for girls and boys from grades 8 to 12. In 1894, the state took over the school, which became known as the New Jersey State Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth.
Over the next three decades dormitories, administration and assembly buildings, athletic fields, educational and vocational trades buildings were constructed. The 400-acre campus eventually included over thirty trade, academic, and residential buildings and two working farms. Students helped to run the school as part of their education. They operated the school’s farms and orchards, prepared meals, ran printing presses, repaired and maintained buildings, operated mechanical systems, and carried out major landscaping and site work projects. The curriculum included training in educational subjects and industrial and manual trades.
In June 1955, the Bordentown School closed, after the 1947 New Jersey Constitution made segregation in public education unlawful and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in schools and other public facilities to be unlawful. The state converted the school into the E.R. Johnstone Training Center for the developmentally disabled, which closed in the early 1990s.

Indeed, the first object listed in the Certificate of incorporation was to operate as a commercial farm.
Following the death of Dr. Kindred in the 1920's, his son, Dr. John Cramer Kindred, managed the Belle Mead Farm Colony and Sanatorium, and married Katherine Carrier. In 1951, Russell Neff Carrier, M.D., Katherine's brother, started working at the Sanatorium as Medical Director. In 1956, Dr. Carrier purchased the Sanatorium that then became the Carrier Clinic. In the 1960's, the Carrier Clinic was expanded into several patient units. Dr. Carrier continued working on his goal of providing the best care for his patients in a home-like environment.
In 1977, Carrier Clinic became a non-profit organization and was renamed The Carrier Foundation. Specialty units for adolescents and older adults were developed, as were specialty treatment programs for anxiety, mood disorders, and other conditions. On May 21, 2014, Carrier Clinic celebrated the beginning of its $21 Million building and renovation project with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by over 200 community leaders, partners, and employees.
In June 2014, Carrier was again awarded a contract for a Carrier Diversion Program (CDP) for the Southern region, primarily Ocean County residents. This program diverts patients from state psychiatric hospitals to Carrier, where they receive psychiatric treatment, medication and programming designed to promote stability, health, recovery, wellness and a return to the community.

In 1892, Mr. DeGraw — the man who was responsible for the trolley line that connected Fort Lee to Hackensack — built a house at the intersection of Teaneck Road and Fort Lee Road. (Fort Lee Road was later renamed DeGraw Avenue.) In the early 1900s, the DeGraw family sold the home to Max Blochwitz. Some time between 1910 and 1915, Mr. Blochwitz gave us the name ""Bright Side Manor"" and began caring for people with epilepsy. In the 1930s, the home was advertised as a place ""for the treatment and care of incurables, chronic diseases, and general invalidism."" In 1955, Jesse and Pearl Wallace took over operations at Bright Side. In 1960, they added a one-story wing that allowed them to convert the building into a nursing home.
In 1990, Geriatric Services, Inc., saw potential and acquired the facility, which, at that time, was owned and operated as a residential health care facility by World for Christ Crusade. Geriatric Services, Inc., immediately reached out to the community for support and involvement. With tremendous volunteer and in-kind support, along with grants and private contributions, Bright Side Manor raised the $5 million necessary to transform itself into a modern, clean, and cheerful home.

New Jersey,Atlantic County Insane Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Atlantic_County_Insane_Asylum,,,"May 20, 1896",Preserved,"Single Building,",William G. Hoopes,Atlantic County Hospital for Mental Diseases,"The county insane asylum is located at 201 Shore road, in the City of Northfield.  The building is of brick and was erected in 1895. At a meeting of the Board of  Freeholders, in the early part of that year (January 9th) Tobias L. McConnell, steward of the almshouse, suggested to the board the wisdom of providing means for taking care of the insane patients of the county on the almshouse property.  The question was discussed  informally and referred to a special committee to inquire into the practicability of the suggestion and report at a subsequent meeting of the board. The reason behind this suggestion was to save county money housing the chronic and incurable insane of the county.
At the following meeting, held on March 13th, the committee reported through Freeholder John T. Irving, that they had visited the asylums of Camden and Burlingotn Counties, and the results in both counties were very satisfactory, both as to the condition of the patients and the cost of maintenance. The committee was thereupon instructed to procure an approximate estimate of the cost of a building suited to the needs of Atlantic County. Two months later this committee reported an approximate estimate of the cost of maintaining the proposed county lunatic asylum at $3,500 annually after deducting the amount to be derived from the State. The following
resolution was therefore adopted:  ""Resolved, That a committee of seven be appointed to secure plans, invite proposals and award a contract for the erection of an insane asylum and that work on the same be commenced and pushed to  completion at the earliest possible date.""
Mr. Irving offered a second resolution, which was also adopted, providing for an issue of county bonds, not exceeding $25,000 in the aggregate, to pay for the proposed asylum.  Plan were prepared by William G. Hoopes, architect, proposals were invited and the contract awarded on August 13, 1895 to J. Summerill Smith, of Atlantic City, for the sum of $21,490.  Including extras and furnishings, the first cost of the asylum was slightly in excess of $23,000.  The building was finished in the early part of 1896, and the patients in the State Asylum, at Trenton, thirty-five in number, were transferred to Northfield in March.  Mr. McConnell had been previously elected
superintendent and Mrs. McConnell, matron.
The name of the ""Atlantic County Asylum For Insane"" was officially given the institution on January 8, 1896, on the motion of Freeholder John T. Irving. Upon opening on March 20, 1896 the asylum took in the 36 patients transferred from Trenton. The average admission rate was around 24 patients a year. The original was a simple corridor plan building, however shorty afterwards two wing additions were made, giving the building its current U shape.
Since the completion of the building two additions have been made. A wing was first added to the men's ward and about the beginning of 1904 a similar extension of the women's ward was finished. The total cost of the building, including furnishings and extensions, is $73,000. The dining room is now in the basement, and it is proposed
to erect another wing in the near future, with a dining room on the main floor.  The view on another page was made from a photograph
taken in 1900, before the wings were added.
As of May 1904 the number of inmates was 73--37 male and 36 female--or about double the number when the institution was opened.  The number of admissions since 1895 has 
been 1936.  During the same period 58 have died and 40 have been discharged as cured. The county farm, which surrounds the asylum and almshouse, contains ninety acres, exclusive of meadow land. The farm alone is valued at $30,000.  It cost the county $1,700 in 1837, when old Gloucester County was dismembered by the creation of the new county of Atlantic.
The insane asylum has saved the county an average of nearly $10,000 a year during the past eight years, and has thus paid for itself.  This saving is due to the greater cost of maintaining the county insane at the State Asylum, in Trenton.  The wisdom of Superintendent McConnell's recommendation to the board is apparent in this decreased cost of maintaining the indigent insane of the county. That the institution is properly conducted and is a model asylum is evidenced by a presentment made by the grand jury to the court at Mayslanding on April 27, 1904
Today the building still stand and is currently occupied by County Health Services, now known as the Stillwater building. North of the building is the former Almshouse, which is the newer structure built in 1912 to replace the older wooden one. In 1956 the almshouse was converted to a hospital for the chronically ill and geriatric.

New Jersey,Burlington County Insane Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Burlington_County_Insane_Asylum,1799,,1801,Demolished,Single Building,,Evergreen Park Mental Hospital | Buttonwood Hospital | Buttonwood Behavioral Health Hospital,"The Burlington County Insane Asylum is located on Pemberton-Browns Mills Road just east of Burlington County College on the north side of the road. The county established its first institution here in 1799 when it purchased the Josiah Gaskill estate, a farm comprising 472 acres. Here the county set up its poor farm and almshouse. The county built the first building there in 1801, a structure to house the poor and indigent measuring 40' x 80'. Workers added a new wing to the building during the mid-nineteenth century.
In 1900, Burlington County constructed an insane asylum at the growing complex. A fire occurred in 1920 which destroyed the hospital associated with the almshouse. During the second decade of the twentieth century, the county added a tuberculosis hospital called Fairview Sanatorium. A fire destroyed the old almshouse and the county made plans to construct a new one based on plans drawn by architect Hugh A. Kelly of Trenton. He designed the new two-story almshouse/nursing home to conform with the colonial revival styling of the insane asylum. With the completion of the new building, the county named it Buttonwood Hall and named its older insane asylum Evergreen Park. Subsequently, the county razed the old tuberculosis hospital and in more recent years added the Post House and the juvenile detention center to the complex.
A large portion of the main building came under new private ownership in 2012 and was renamed Aspen Hills Healthcare Center. Buttonwood Behavioral Health Hospital remains connected to it as a separate entity in place of what was known as Evergreen Park.",,New Lisbon,,,[1900],[None],[None],[None],[None],0

As was usual at the time the insane were cared for in the county almshouse, usually in separate cells or small separate buildings.  Originally in Camden the insane were maintained in the almshouse building, however a dozen years after this first admittance the County Freeholders decided it was prudent to erect a separate building for the insane, still under administration of the almshouse. This building was a two story wood framed structure comprised of individual cells and was referred to as the ""mad house"". After her 1839 visit Dorothea Dix referred to it as ""populous with imbecile, insane and epileptic patients -- 25-30 individuals. [It] contains ranges of small cells altogether unfit for the individuals they house."" Also recorded at this time is the apparent use of ""Ravine Cells"". According to first person accounts some of the earliest Blackwood facilities were ""barn-like"" cells running along the ravine and fitted with small doors.
The most disturbed patients were housed in confinement cages on the ground floor; the second floor was for the less disturbed; and the third floor would house the asylum's steward or matron and their families. This was at a time when the superintendent earned $800/year and the weekly cost to house a patient was $1.50. This new facility was known as the Camden County Insane Asylum at Blackwood.
Over the next 47 years, additions and improvements were made to the original brick structure until, by 1925, the asylum had grown to include a nurses' residence; an admission building where new patients were examined and observed; and a service bridge across the ravine connecting the old brick asylum to the new admission building. At the same time, Timber Creek was dammed, providing a scenic lake and giving the facility its new name: The Camden County Insane Hospital at Lakeland.
From the 1960s through the 1980s, Lakeland was rocked by charges of inefficient operations, the ups and downs of political uncertainties and negative community perceptions. By 1998 the decision was made to consolidate county operations into a single, modern facility occupying 226,000 square feet. Today that sprawling complex at Lakeland is known as the Camden County Health Services Center, part of which is a modern, 158-bed Behavioral Health facility that, along with Ancora Psychiatric Hospital, provides state-of-the-art psychiatric care for the residents of Camden County.",1998,"Blackwood, NJ",,,1803,,158,,,0

New Jersey,Essex County Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Essex_County_Hospital,,1896,1896,Partially Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Essex County Hospital Center | Overbrook,"In 1896, a large portion of land was purchased by the Essex County board of Chosen Freeholders; the land was bought to build a new mental institution, known as Overbrook, to replace the overcrowding at the original hospital in Newark. The first building to be built on the property was the ""Star Ward"". It was a large, x shaped building on the eastern section of the campus. It soon became overcrowded, and The ""Hill Buildings"" were built in 1909. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, many buildings were built that housed mental patients and other facilities, such as a power house, laundromat, and theater. In the campus's history, it had a total of 47 buildings. In 1978 alone, there were 150 reports of patients gone missing from this complex, including one patient who strolled off in his pajamas, broke into a nearby home, took a knife and hammer and attempted to kidnap a woman in the house while stealing her car. He was later caught in a neighboring state.
During the 1940s and 1950s, the hospital's population peaked. However, during the 1960s and 1970s, new medicines were invented to help mental patients and the hospital's population decreased drastically. By the 1990s, the hospital had a very small population. There was no need for such a large facility anymore. The hospital fully closed on February 27th, 2007. The land was quickly sold to a developer, however the county decided to take back 90 acres in order to make a park. Demolition of the buildings on the grounds started in August of 2008.
Hospital scenes in the finals season of ""the Sopranos"" were filmed in portions of this asylum, as well as scenes from the  movie, “Choke,” based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk. In the movie, the hospital will be referred to as St. Anthony’s.","Feb. 27, 2007",,,,1896,2007,,,,0

New Jersey,Hudson County Hospital for the Insane,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hudson_County_Hospital_for_the_Insane,1864,1894 (Independent building),1864,Active,Pavilion Plan (Original),,Hudson County Insane Asylum | Hudson County Hospital Mental Diseases | Hospital for Mental Diseases of Hudson County at Laurel Hill | Meadowview Psychiatric Hospital,"The Hudson County Hospital for the Insane was located on what was then called Snake Hill, now Laurel Hill, which was a large igneous rock formation jutting some 150 feet from the floor of the otherwise flat swamps of the New Jersey ""Meadowlands"". Snake Hill first housed the counties Penitentiary and Almshouse, where the county's insane were maintained from their creation in 1863 until the construction of an independent Asylum Institution in 1894. This new building was located adjacent to the almshouse and was built originally for 250 patients.
The design consisted of a central administration building flanked on either side by a male and female wing which began as a single ward building each and connected to the administration via connecting ""bridges"". This building was four stories tall and 552 feet long and 8- feet wide. In 1916 it was recorded by the American Medico-Psychological Association; Committee on a History of the Institutional Care of the Insane, that a new wing on the male side was being constructed with modern treatment apparatus and planned was a similar expansion to the female side. The administration housed apartments for the superintendent as well as the hospitals offices.
As was the standard procedure at the time the county asylum provided housing for the chronic insane of the county, providing custodial care rather than real treatment. The acute cases and those deemed curable were sent to the State Insane Hospitals such as Trenton State Hospital or Greystone Park State Hospital.
It was recorded in the 1906 Annual Report that the hospital was maintained in a clean and orderly fashion however was over double capacity, housing 243 male and 327 female patients. By 1910 it as already being suggested that the Asylum be moved to a new location with 200-300 acres as it was hopelessly overcrowded, with 800 patients in space remodeled to accommodate 350 patients. As of 1916 the building was reported to have had accommodation for between 450 to 500 patients though it can be assumed, as with all hospitals at the time, that patient populations had since increased since 1906. By this time the municipal complex on Snake Hill included the Insane Asylum, the Penitentiary and it's quarry, Almshouse, Tuberculosis hospital, Isolation Hospital, and electric light substation.
In 1927 the Asylum was moved to another location on County Avenue in Secaucus and shortly afterwards it's name was changed to the Hudson County Hospital Mental Diseases. Aerial images from as early as 1931 show that the original asylum buildings had been demolished after this move rather than re-purposed for other county uses. At the new location treatments both Insulin and Metrazol shock therapy was used. In 1939 the hospital's population was reported at 1,872. The hospital continues to operate as a county mental hospital today as the Meadowview Psychiatric Hospital.
The Meadowview Hospital was the victim of serious neglect, losing state funding and license in the 1990's and in 1995 services were contracted out. The hospital began a slow road to recovery and in 2011 became an accredited mental health facility. It continues to serve the residents of Hudson County and offers 84 beds with inpatients and outpatient treatment.
By 1962 most of the buildings on snake hill lay vacant and that same year the county closed the final operating institutions on Snake Hill and began a process of Quarrying which reduced the hill by four fifths its size. Snake Hill made headlines in 2002 when while digging for the new Secaucus Junction workers stumbled upon the former Snake Hill Potter's field which was long since forgotten. The bodies, almost 10,000, were removed and interred at Maple Grove Cemetery, Hackensack, Bergen County, New Jersey. This discovery prompted the making of the documentary ""Snake Hill"", released in 2007.

New Jersey,Salem County Insane Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Salem_County_Insane_Asylum,1796,,1806,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Salem County Insane Asylum | The County House | Lakeview Complex,"The Salem County Almshouse and Insane Asylum can trace its roots as an institution for poor relief as far back as 1796 where it began as a simple tavern that was purchased to house the county’s indignant population. In 1806, the original tavern building was demolished and a brick poorhouse building was constructed and opened in 1808. An addition was built on to house the county’s insane in 1825. That building burnt down in a fire in 1845 and a new almshouse was built on the old foundation. In 1870 the insane asylum was built next door to the almshouse. The buildings sat on over 200 acres of farming land, where inmates worked to grow crops such as corn, oat, wheat, rye, and buckwheat. One-half acre of the farm was reserved as a burial ground for deceased inmates and is now known as the County Home Cemetery.
New Jersey was one of the few states at the time that utilized county-built insane asylums in addition or in replacement of larger state hospitals.
The Almshouse segregated men and women inmates, housing men on the first floor and women on the second. There were an uneven number of bedrooms available to men and women, with the men’s floor having three more available bedrooms than the women’s floor. The third floor contained fifteen rooms, including at least four cells, presumably for solitary confinement of unruly inmates.
The Insane Asylum is a three-story cubical building and contained twelve cells and rooms, both with heavy iron doors and locks, alongside one bathroom. Iron gates also covered the small windows placed in each cell. One report stated the cells and water closets were in a “very foul condition.” By 1885, the small asylum was overcrowded and in 1906 construction for a new, larger asylum was approved but was never carried out.
The Salem County asylum continued to house the mentally ill until 1925 when patients were sent to the State Hospital at Trenton or the State Village for Epileptics. The building, along with the original almshouse building, served as housing for the poor until 1951 when both buildings were converted to a nursing home. Twenty years later, the nursing home was closed and the buildings housed county offices. The almshouse and asylum buildings sat vacant since 1995 when the offices moved to more suitable working spaces. Due to years of neglect, the almshouse collapsed in on itself and was demolished in 2007. The asylum building remains mostly intact and is abandoned. It is the only surviving example of a first-generation county insane asylum in New Jersey and is now listed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. There are no plans to preserve this historic building from its worn, crumbling structure and its exposure to the elements.
Dorothea Dix, social reformer and advocate for the humane care of the mentally ill, visited The Salem County Almshouse and Insane Asylum in 1844 and presented her findings on the county asylums of New Jersey to the state legislature the following year. Her report shamed the legislature for their failure to follow up on their own investigation years earlier which stated the obvious need for state hospitals. She reported a growing number of insane being kept in county jails, state prisons, and poor houses in deplorable conditions. She noted patients being kept in chains and not being let out of their rooms for years at a time. Typical treatments of the insane at this time included restraints and long periods or permanent seclusion.

New Jersey,Middlesex County Tuberculosis Sanitorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Middlesex_County_Tuberculosis_Sanitorium,,,1937,Preserved,Single Building,,Roosevelt Hospital,"Built during the Great Depression with Federal financing as the Middlesex County Tuberculosis Sanitorium, this massive four-story, Colonial Revival structure is built of red brick with limestone trim. Situated on a majestic hill overlooking a picturesque park, it has a large two-story entry porch and a grand 46-foot high center cupola. Today, Roosevelt Hospital stands as a grand monument to the New Deal, to the history of public health efforts, and to the era when tuberculosis was a menace. The building remained a tuberculosis hospital until the 1950s, when antibiotics decreased the ferocity of the disease, after which the hospital became a long-term health care facility.
The hospital has seen two major additions over the years: in 1963, a 100-bed section was added for long-term care and outpatient treatment, and in 1982, and additional 250-bed section brought the hospital to its present capacity of over 500 beds. During the recent years, Roosevelt Hospital has been losing money, and Middlesex County officials have been negotiating to sell the property to a heathcare facility operator who wants to replce the hospital with two new 180-bed nursing homes. In 2004 Middlesex County decided to rehabilitate the original portion of the hospital as a nursing home and demolish the 1960's addition on the south side of the building.

Hagedorn Gero-Psychiatric Hospital  | Hagedorn Psychiatric Hospital,"In 1907, New Jersey opened its only state owned and operated sanatorium in Glen Gardner. It was intended to be a model institution, providing individual and public health benefits to an expected 500 case annually. Described at the time as “largely educational in character, which would give a practical demonstration of up-to-date methods of treating .... tuberculosis”, the facility treated more than 10,000 between 1907 and 1929.
The sanatorium's mission was broadened and the effects of long-term care assessed by the 1920s. The scope was broadened to incorporate cases in all levels of severity, regardless of the original intention to only treat ""incipients, or 'curables'"". The sanatorium's treatment remained reatively unchanged until the middle of the twentieth century when medication became the prevailing treatment. In 1950, the sanatorium broaden it's scope once again, but this to to include all chest diseases, and the name was changed to the New Jersey Hospital for Chest Diseases.
In 1977, the hospital changed its name again to the Senator Garret W. Hagedorn Gero-Psychiatric Hospital as it focused on its new calling as a state nursing home and eventually a 288-bed psychiatric hospital. The hospital’s premier location high up on a mountaintop with 600 acres of provided inpatient, comprehensive psychiatric treatment for adult patients. The hospital stated as its mission “to provide quality interdisciplinary psychiatric services that maximize potential and community reintegration within a safe and caring environment.”
In 2011, New Jersey decided to close the smallest of New Jersey’s four public mental hospitals. Even with a one-year reprieve by New Jersey’s legislature, Governor Chris Christie has targeted Hagedorn as the one to close. Governor Christie explained that by closing Hagedorn New Jersey would save $9 million annually.  It would also result in the closure of Freedom House (a center for treating addiction on the Hagedorn campus). Local residents expressed concern about the future of the 600-acre property.
