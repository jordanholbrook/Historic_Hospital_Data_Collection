Ohio,Apple Creek State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Apple_Creek_State_Hospital,,,1931,Closed,Cottage Plan,Joseph A. Gattozzi,Apple Creek State Institute | Apple Creek Developmental Center,"It began Feb. 14, 1931, Valentine’s Day, when the Apple Creek State School opened in what had been a tuberculosis hospital. It was the third such center in the state. The others were in Columbus and Gallipolis. While most patients in the early days were “feeble-minded,’ as they were labeled, the place held a mixture of the mentally retarded and mentally ill, alcoholics, cerebral palsy sufferers, unwed mothers. By 1947, the institution had blossomed into a small city covering more than 2,100 acres, much of it dedicated to raising crops, chickens, cattle and hogs. It had its own power and sewage-treatment plants, along with cemeteries where 128 people are buried.
Closed in 2006 due to lack of maintenance funds. Most of the buildings have been demolished, only a few remain. The site is expected to be turned over to Ohio State University’s Agricultural Technical Institute, which already uses nearby land that was once part of the Apple Creek campus.
This video is from 1965 when a reporter visited the hospital with a hidden camera.
Located adjacent to the Apple Creek Presbyterian Cemetery. This cemetery serves as a ""potter's plot"" for those who were wards of the State that died while committed to the Apple Creek Developmental Center. It contains the graves of around 130 patients.",2006,"Apple Creek, OH",,"2,300 in 1958",1931,2006,,,,0
Ohio,Athens State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Athens_State_Hospital,1867,1868,1874,Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Levi T. Scofield,Athens Lunatic Asylum  | Athens Asylum for the Insane  | Athens Mental Health and Retardation Center | Southeast Ohio State Hospital | Athens Mental Health Center  | The Ridges / Lin Hall (Current),"In 1867 the Ohio Legislature appointed a commission to find a site for an asylum in south-eastern Ohio. A site in Athens was found suitable. Construction began in 1867 and the Athens Lunatic Asylum was completed during 1874. Levi T. Scofield was the architect. The Athens Mental Health Center opened on January 9, 1874 on land purchased from the Coate's farm. The asylum itself was built from bricks which were fired on-site from clay dug on-site. Herman Haerlin, a student of Frederick Law Olmstead (the designer of Central Park), was responsible for the design of the hospital and its grounds. By the turn of the twentieth century, orchards and farmland were maintained on the property, tended to by hospital residents and employees. This made the hospital nearly self-sufficient. Nevertheless, at the time of its construction it was a major boon to the economy of the city of Athens, which was able to supply milk, eggs, linens, and other necessities. Local citizens made use of Haerlin's extensive grounds, which included landscaped hills and trees, a pond, a spring, and a creek with a falls.
The Administration building housed offices of the Superintendent, assistant physicians, steward, and a general reception room for visitors. Two wings added to the building were used for patients. The second floor contained apartments of the medical superintendent. The third and fourth floors were used for administrative offices.
Over the years the buildings and grounds at the Athens Mental Health Center underwent many changes. In the 1920s a fire destroyed the grand ballroom. In 1924 a building was erected on the grounds for the treatment of mentally ill patients with tuberculosis. In 1928 the dairy barn went in, making the hospital almost self-sufficient. Later, in 1960, part of the farmland belonging to the hospital was acquired by Ohio University for the construction of the Convocation Center. Between 1968 and 1972 the Hocking River and State Route 682 were rerouted, eliminating the reservoir as well as four of the decorative lakes on the property.
In 1977 multiple personality rapist Billy Milligan was sent by a Franklin County judge to Athens for treatment after his insanity plea was accepted by prosecutors--a first in American history. Milligan had kidnapped and raped three women on campus at Ohio State but had been suffering from mutliple personality disorder from early childhood. His story was told in the book The Minds of Billy Milligan by Daniel Keyes (the author of Flowers for Algernon). Billy Milligan's stay at the Ridges was among the last ever. In 1972 the last patients were buried in the asylum cemetery; by 1981 the hospital housed fewer than 300 patients. 344 acres of land were transferred to Ohio University. The final patients left the Athens Center in 1993, when they were bused to a new, much smaller hospital across town. The building stood vacant for several years while Ohio University prepared to renovate it into museum, office, and classroom space.
In 2001 renovation work was completed on the main building, which today is known as Lin Hall and houses music, geology, and biotechnology offices, as well as the Kennedy Museum of Art. Nearly all of the dozens of hospital buildings have been remodeled and put to use by the University.[1]  Although the main administration building and some sections of the patient wings have been renovated, much of the Kirkbride is still empty and awaiting reuse.
Like many other Kirkbrides, the building sits on top of a hill. It faces the nearby Hocking River looking toward the center of Athens and the main campus of Ohio University. The building appears to be in exceptionally good condition, although the cupolas which used to crown parts of the roof are now missing. The ward interiors don't have much in terms of remaining nineteenth-century architectural details either.[2]

Ohio,Broadview Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Broadview_Developmental_Center,,,1939,Demolished,Single Building,,Broadview Veterans Administration Hospital,"In the 1930s, a grand hospital was built by the Federal Government. It opened in 1939 and was called the Broadview VA hospital. It provided general medical and surgical services to veterans. After the war, all patients were moved to Crile Hospital and the building was used for Tuberculosis patients. In the late 1940s the building became too small for TB patients. Another wing was built east off the back of the original building.
August of 1961, Brecksville VA Hospital opened on Miller Road and Route 21. It was associated with Wade Park VA Hospital which opened in June 1964, taking in all patients from Crile Hospital which was sold to Cuyahoga Community College. A mixture of patients in the old building were relocated.
In 1965 the property was sold to the State of Ohio for $1 to be used for mentally handicapped patients. Several additional buildings were constructed on the property for housing. In 1972 the Thorin Building (now known as the Community Building) opened for offices, classrooms, and recreation.
In 1987 the State closed the old hospital building and all clients were housed in cottages. Then in 1992 the State moved out of the Broadview Developmental Center altogether. Several of the outlying buildings continued to house patients through a private operator.
In 1995 the General Assembly voted to sell Broadview Developmental Center to the City of Broadview Heights; it became official in 1996 when the City purchased the 68-acre property for $750,000. In 1998 the Recreation and Human Services Departments moved into the Thorin Building at the newly-renamed ""Broadview Center"". The Thorin Building underwent extensive renovation, and in 1999 City Hall moved into what is now called ""The Community Building"".
One of the outlying cottages was renovated for the Police Department which moved to the Broadview Center in 2000. The Service Department renovated and moved into the former Dietary Building and the steam power house was demolished. Buildings 9, 10, and 11 were also renovated for use by the Service Department. A new service garage and salt bin were constructed in 2003, then a skatepark in 2004. Other outlying buildings soon housed various organizations including the community theater, photo club, garden club, historical society, Lend-a-Hand, etc.
The old hospital was demolished in 2006. A playground was built in 2007, football field in 2009, and a pavilion in 2011. The grounds of the Broadview Center continue to change with the needs of the community.",1966 (VA)/1993,"Broadview Heights, OH",,,1939,1992,,,,0
Ohio,Cleveland State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cleveland_State_Hospital,,1852,1855,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,,Northern Ohio Lunatic Asylum | Newburgh State Hospital | Cleveland Development Center,"The Cleveland State Hospital was a state-supported psychiatric facility for long-term care. Originally known as the Northern Ohio Lunatic Asylum, it was the second of 6 public asylums established in Ohio during the 1850s. It was later known as Newburgh State Hospital. The Northern Ohio Lunatic Asylum was authorized by an act of the Ohio legislature. The main building, containing 100 beds, was completed in 1855 on land in Newburgh donated by the family of James A. Garfield, later U.S. president. Previously, many of those considered insane had been kept in jails or almshouses. The asylum was to provide a quiet place outside the city where healthy, moral living habits could be learned (although management of disturbed patients then also included seclusion, cuffs, straps, strait-jackets, and cribs). The hospital was run by a 5-member Board of Trustees appointed by the governor, with Dr. Horace Ackley the first chair and superintendent. In its first 100 years, the hospital had 21 different superintendents; the last, Dr. William Grover, served for 18 years.
In its early years, the hospital had a homelike atmosphere; patients and staff usually dined together. An ""open"" facility, most patients were free to make use of the grounds. After a fire in 1872, a more substantial structure was built, with capacity for 650 patients. But by 1874 there were reports of overcrowding, a persistent problem. By 1900 the hospital had cared for over 10,000 patients. At this time it began to treat mainly poorer patients, including an increasing number admitted by the courts, further adding to patient numbers (2,000 by 1920). Although Cleveland State Hospital kept pace with progress in medicine, conditions continued to decline in the 1920s and 1930s because of overcrowding and irregular state support. In 1946 investigations by the Cleveland Press and the newly formed Cleveland Mental Health Assn. revealed brutality and criminal neglect, and often squalid conditions.
Conditions improved with the development of social services, psychology, group work, occupational therapy, volunteer services, and out-patient clinics, but budget cutbacks in 1961 eliminated 29 activity programs. In 1962, for 2,700 patients there were 12 ward doctors and 10 registered nurses to supervise 250 attendants. During the 1960s, the patient population dropped from 3,000 to 1,800, closer to the intended capacity of 1,500. The state began phasing out the Cleveland State Hospital in 1972; in 1975 it became the Cleveland Development Center, a care facility for the mentally retarded. The Cleveland Developmental Center was a short-lived care center for the mentally retarded. The old main building on Turney Rd. was demolished in 1977.[1]

Ohio,Cleveland Receiving Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cleveland_Receiving_Hospital,,,1945,Closed,Single Building,,Cleveland Psychiatric Institute (CPI),"CPI was established when the Ohio legislature approved the creation of a statewide system of receiving hospitals, including one in Cuyahoga County. State officials entered into an agreement with Cleveland City Hospital (Metropolitan General) to assume control of the acute-care facility at Hoover Pavilion (built in 1922) on 1 Nov. 1946. The name CPI has been in use since the early 1960s. Poor state management practices and bureaucratic red tape demoralized the early hospital's staff and delayed improvements as did crowded conditions. Doctors resigned because of low pay and regulations banning private patients. Western Reserve Univ. temporarily withdrew its affiliation in 1949. Program and physical-plant improvements have been slowly made since the 1950s; an out-patient clinic opened in 1952 and a therapy wing was added to Hoover Pavilion in 1957. In 1981 CPI combined its operations with the Fairhill Mental Health Center; the Fairhill Center closed its doors in 1983. Cleveland State Receiving Hospital, is a short-term psychiatric-care hospital for the observation, care, and treatment of the mentally ill, especially those patients with mild conditions in the early stages and possibly of short duration.",2009,"Cleveland, OH",,,,,,,,1
Ohio,Columbus State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Columbus_State_Hospital,,1835/ Rebuilt 1870,1838/ Reopened 1877,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,,Lunatic Asylum of Ohio | Ohio Lunatic Asylum | Central Ohio Psychiatric Hospital,"The ""Lunatic Asylum of Ohio"" was organized by Act of the Thirty-fourth General Assembly, passed March 5, 1835, and Samuel Parsons, William M. Awl and Samuel F. Maccracken were appointed directors. These Directors selected a tract of land about one mile east and north of the State House, in Columbus, comprising thirty acres. This tract fronted south on what is now East Broad street, and the western boundary was near what is now Washington avenue. During the next three years they erected a building on these grounds, at a cost of about sixty-one thousand ($61,000) dollars. The institution accommodated one hundred and twenty patients, and was the first institution for the treatment of the insane organized west of the Alleghenies. On May 21, 1838, William M. Awl, M. D., of Columbus, was elected Medical Superintendent by the Trustees, and the first patient was received on November 30 of that year.
The building was two hundred and ninety-five feet in length and contained one hundred and fifty-three single rooms. The Directors apologized for the apparently extravagant size by saying that it would be required in a few years. Yet it was the only asylum the state then had. Now—1900-1—the state has accommodations for more than seven thousand five hundred patients in the several ""State Hospitals"" at Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Longview, Massillon and Toledo, and every institution is crowded to its full capacity. Dr. Awl was in charge as Superintendent until 1850, a period of twelve years, when he was succeeded by Samuel H. Smith, M. D. He was succeeded in 1852 by E. Kendrick, M. D., and he by George E. Eels, M. D., in June 1854. On August 1, 1855, Dr. Richard Gundry, who later became so prominent in the care of the insane in Ohio and the United States, was appointed Assistant Physician. In July, 1856, Dr. R. Hills, of Delaware, was appointed Superintendent. He held the position for several years, and was succeeded by Dr. William L. Peck.
On the evening of November 18, 1868, the asylum caught fire and was almost completely destroyed. There were three hundred and fourteen patients in the asylum, and six were suffocated by the smoke before they could be rescued. The others were removed to the the asylums at Cleveland, Dayton, and Cincinnati, which had been built since this one was organized. On April 23, 1869, an Act was passed by the Legislature authorizing the re-building of the asylum on the old grounds, and contracts were let September 23, 1869, and work was begun on the foundation October 24, of that year. Winter soon stopped the work, however, and during the ensuing session of the Legislature, on the 18th of April, 1870, a bill was passed authorizing the sale of the old tract and the purchase of a new site to contain three hundred acres of land. Governor R. B. Hayes, State Treasurer S. S. Warner, and Attorney General F. B. Pond were appointed a Commission to sell the old site and to purchase a new one. They were required to sell the old site at a price not less than $200,000, and to purchase a new site of not less than three hundred acres at a cost not to exceed $100,000. The Commission reported in favor of the purchase of three hundred acres from William S. Sullivant, on the high lands west of Columbus and across the Scioto valley, paying therefore two hundred and fifty dollars per acre. The Trustees took charge of this tract, which is the present site of the Hospital, on May 5, 1870. The site of the building was determined upon, work was begun under the old contracts, which had been transferred to the new site, and the corner-stone was laid on July 4 of that year. The institution was finally completed on July 4, 1877, just seven years from the laying of the corneer-stone on July 4, 1870. The total cost of construction at the time of the opening was $1,520,980.45—at the time of writing (1901) the cost of construction has exceeded $2,000,000.
The first patient was admitted into the new Hospital on August 23, 1877, and this patient is still an inmate of the Institution, twenty-years later. The Hospital, as completed, stands on an elevated plateau about three miles west of High street, on the north side of Broad street, facing almost directly east. It consists of a central Administration Building and two wings, of four sections each, and a rear wing. The lateral wings and the Administration Building have a lineal frontage of about 1200 feet, and the rear wing and Administration Building have a depth of about 800 feet. It is nearly all four stories in height, and the distance around the foundation walls is about one and one-quarter miles. The building when opened, accommodated eight hundred and fifty-two patients. In the wings for the patients there were four hundred single rooms and one hundred and sixteen associated dormitories for the us of patients. There were twenty-eight wards from 120 to 180 feet in length, and each ward contained bath, lavatory, water-closet, clothing room and two rooms for attendants.[1]
The hospital remained in service until the late 1980s, despite falling into severe disrepair. It was demolished in 1997 and new Ohio Department of Transportation and Ohio Department of Public Safety facilities were built near its former location. Four patient cemeteries of the Columbus State Hospital still exist.

In the year 1875, it was changed to Western Ohio Hospital for the Insane; in 1877, to the Dayton Hospital for the Insane; in 1878, to the Dayton Asylum for the Insane; and in 1894, to the Dayton State Hospital and was located on a hill southeast of the city of Dayton.
The main building was built to the Kirkbride plan, consisting of the administration building, four stories in height, and the wards on either side three stories in height. The original building contained six wards, three on either side of the administration building, with a capacity of 164 patients. In 1861, the capacity of the Hospital was increased to 600 by the addition of six wards on each side. In 1891, it was again enlarged by the addition of congregate dining rooms, one on each side, which increased the capacity 170, giving a total capacity of 770. The Hospital had a frontage of 940 feet, and is uniformly three stories in height, except the administration building, which is four stories and surmounted by a cupola.
The Dayton State Hospital stood empty for many years, replaced by more modern facilities. While, in the mid-1980s, plans were being made to renovate the buildings and convert them into apartments for retirees, there was a fire in the old administration building and the cupola was destroyed. The damage to the rest of the administration building was comparatively minor and the plans to convert the buildings became a reality. But many mourned the loss of the cupola, a Dayton landmark for more than a century.
The Dayton State Hospital survives to this day as one of only a small handful of surviving Kirkbride Plan institutions in the state of Ohio. Of those remaining institutions, it is perhaps the only one in continued usage to this day. After the fire damage was repaired the building was successfully renovated into a now large retirement community called 10 Wilmington Place, and has served the Dayton area for the past 29 years.[1]
After the main hospital was closed in 1977, part of complex continued to operate as Twin Valley Behavioral Hospital, until it to was closed June 30, 2008. The property was sold in 2012 to a private Ohio based organization and reopened as Access Hospital and Access Outpatient.

Ohio,Fairhill Psychiatric Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fairhill_Psychiatric_Hospital,,,1956,Preserved,Single Building,,Fairhill Mental Health Center | Fairhill Center for Aging (Current),"The Fairhill Campus has served the Greater Cleveland community for over 78 years. In 1837 the Medical Board of Marine Hospitals designated Cleveland as the site of a hospital to benefit sick seamen, boatmen, and other navigators. By 1916, with a capacity of just 85 beds, the hospital’s original location was deemed too small, and Congress took steps toward relocating the hospital to Fairhill.
On June 28, 1930, with a staff of 15 doctors, 42 nurses and 72 attendants, the US Marine Hospital was opened. By 1953, that number decreased significantly, and Congress voted to close the hospital. The Marine Hospital closed on June 30, 1953. The hospital was reopened as the Fairhill Psychiatric Hospital in 1956. In 1973, the main building was remodeled and a new two-story addition was added to the front of the original structure.[1]
The Fairhill Mental Health Center was a state psychiatric facility in Cleveland dedicated to intensive, short-term care. It opened as one of 5 state psychiatric facilities in Cleveland in the former U.S. Marine Hospital on Fairhill Road. Although Fairhill originally had a capacity of 200 beds, by 1960 only 70 were in use because of staffing problems. With the enactment of the Community Mental Health Centers Act by Congress in 1963, the name changed to the Fairhill Mental Health Center. Its overall purpose was slightly revised, ""to provide comprehensive psychiatric services to all residents of a given geographical area, regardless of socioeconomic status,"" but it's emphasis remained on short-term care. (Its service area consisted primarily of Cleveland's east side and eastern suburbs.) Fairhill attempted to minimize many of the negative aspects of state mental hospitals, with a cheerful and bright interior and innovative therapeutic programs which encouraged patient involvement. In 1966 Fairhill became one of 3 ""open hospitals"" (no locked doors) in the country.
From the mid-1960s, Fairhill suffered from budgetary restrictions and changing state directives. One result was overcrowding: in 1966 admissions were limited to only 50%, because of delays in transferring patients to long-term hospitals. In 1975 a budget crisis resulted in the transfer of 38 employees to institutions for the mentally retarded; two years later, the hospital's out-patient clinic closed. Despite a $3 million renovation in 1980, overcrowded conditions persisted; the hospital was criticized for early discharges. By 1983, not meeting federal standards, it was in danger of being decertified for Medicare and Medicaid. As the Cleveland Psychiatric Institute was in a similar situation, the Ohio Department of Mental Hygiene & Correction consolidated the two and closed the Fairhill Mental Health Center.  In 1987 the process of developing the Fairhill collaborative campus began. In 1989, the property became the home of the Fairhill Center for Aging, a joint venture of the Benjamin Rose Institute and University Hospital Case Medical Center. In 1995, the site was named a Cleveland Historic Landmark, receiving more than 1,200 visitors a month as of 2002.[2]",1983,"Cleveland, OH",,,1956,1983,200,,70,0

Ohio,Lima State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lima_State_Hospital,1905,1908,1915,Closed,Pavilion Plan,,Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane | Lima Correctional Institution | Oakwood Correctional Facility (Current),"Situated on 628 acres (2.54 km²) three miles (5 km) north of downtown Lima, the hospital was constructed between 1908 and 1915. Built at a cost of $2.1 million, it was the largest poured-concrete structure in the country until superseded by the Pentagon. Its walls are at least 14 inches thick, with steel reinforcement going right down to bedrock.
In 1915 Lima State Hospital began receiving its first patients. Built to house specifically those found guilty of crimes while insane or otherwise too dangerous for the other state run psychiatric institutions. 1953 brought the opening of the Ascherman building, a satellite of the state hospital so the state hospital could start housing regular patients.
For much of its history, Lima State Hospital functioned largely as a warehouse. Patients sometimes staged dramatic protests against the conditions of their confinement, and frequently escaped (more than 300 escapes by 1978). Conditions improved significantly after 1974 as a result of a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the patients. In a landmark ruling, U.S. District Judge Nicholas J. Walinski spelled out detailed requirements for assuring each patient’s rights to “dignity, privacy and human care.” In its last years, the state hospital was used for the filming of a made-for-television movie about the Attica Prison riots in New York.
In 1982 the building was turned over to the Ohio Department of Corrections and became a medium-security prison, the Lima Correctional Institution. The prison closed in 2004, though a smaller prison on the site, the Allen Correctional Institution, remains.
With 1,400 patients and 700 staff members on a 600-acre state facility, Lima was home to many individuals deemed ""criminally insane"" after the Lima State Hospital was built in 1907 on West Street. With the changing times, however, it died down in later decades. And, according to a physician researching and writing books about ""lunatic asylums,"" it eventually closed as part of a national trend that ended the era of such homes for the mentally ill. Though the building still stands as the Oakwood Correctional Facility, south of Bluelick Road, local historians said, it's nowhere near its heyday. During a program Sunday afternoon at the Allen County Museum, Dr. George W. Paulson, of The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, spoke about the Lima facility and the state hospital in Columbus. He discussed the history of the evolution of the mental health system from the late 19th century through the 20th century, based on research for his latest book: ""Hilltop, a Hospital and a Sanctuary for Healing,"" which is co-authored by Dr. Marion Sherman. The Allen County Historical Society presented the program free to the public. ""A lot of people in the community might be interested in this,"" said Patricia Smith, director of the Allen County Museum. ""The facility here was unique because it was for the ‘criminally insane.' They were deemed dangerous."" Paulson, 78, is emeritus professor of neurology at OSU and is the founder and former chairman of the department of neurology, and former chief of staff of University Hospitals. With more than 250 articles and six books, Paulson said his interest in mental health is in part inspired by his past working in such facilities. ""What happened here to the state facility happened all over the country,"" Paulson said. ""Patients went from the back wards to the back alleys, and streets. Some are in prison. ... There's a difference in the way they are treated now. There's much better therapy and research ... but they treat the mentally ill differently."" Paulson said deinstitutionalization of mental health hospitals meant the demolition of many facilities when the trend commenced after 1950.[1]

Ohio,Longview State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Longview_State_Hospital,1821,1856,1927 (State Operated),Demolished,"Kirkbride Plan The hospital has a newer campus close to the original, built in the 1980s",,The Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum of Ohio | Longview Insane Asylum,"The first asylum for the insane erected in Ohio was built in Cincinnati, under an act of the Legislature, passed January 22, 1821, entitled, ""an act establishing a Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum for the state of Ohio."" By the terms of this enactment the trustees of Cincinnati township were to furnish a site for said institution, containing not less than four acres of land, within one mile of the public landing on the Ohio river, and erect the necessary buildings (which were to be of brick) for the safe-keeping, comfort and medical treatment of such idiots, lunatics and insane persons of this state as might be brought to it for these purposes. The trustees were to receive certain compensation for the care of such patients, to be paid by the county sending the same, if paupers, or by the friends or guardians, if the patients had estates.
In addition, the trustees were required to admit and care for, free of charge, all boatmen belonging to boats owned by citizens of Ohio or to boats of the citizens of other states which provided hospital accommodations to boatmen of this state. There were also required to receive into said institution, and care for, all the paupers of Cincinnati township. The institution was to be known as ""The Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum of Ohio."" The state donated, for the purpose of assisting in the erection of said asylum, $10,000 in depreciated or uncurrent bank bills then in the state treasury, from which were realized $3,500 in specie.
The Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum of Ohio was the parent institution from which afterwards sprung the Orphan Asylum, the City Infirmary, the Cincinnati Hospital and Longview Asylum. It was the beginning, on the part of the state, which has led to the establishment of the great benevolent institutions of which every citizen of Ohio is justly proud.
The legislature, on March 7, 1835, authorized the purchase of land for a lunatic asylum, and at the next session authorized the erection of an asylum for the insane on the land recently purchased for that purpose at Columbus. Said institution was to be known as the Lunatic Asylum of Ohio. On March 9, 1838, an act was passed, entitled, ""an act to provide for the safe-keeping of idiots, lunatics or insane persons, the management of their affairs and for other purposes,"" which required all persons found to be lunatics to be sent to the Ohio Lunatic Asylum, and repealing all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provision of said act. Thus the Cincinnati Hospital and Lunatic Asylum of Ohio ceased to be a state institution on March 9, 1838, although the name remained till March 11, 1861, when it was changed to Commercial Hospital of Cincinnati.
The state afterwards, built two additional hospitals for the insane, one at Dayton and the other in the northern part of Ohio, and on April 7, 1856, the legislature passed ""an act to provide for the uniform government and better regulation of the lunatic asylums of the state and the care of idiots and insane,"" which divided the state into three districts, known as the Northern, Central and Southern Districts. Hamilton county, together with thirteen other counties, constituted the Southern District, the asylum for which was located at Dayton, but, on March 10, 1857, the legislature passed an act making Hamilton county a separate district for lunatic asylum purposes, and providing for the erection and government of an asylum therein, and that the commissioners what cause all the insane of the county to be placed in such asylum when completed. The act further provided that the inmates of the asylum be supported and the salaries of its officers paid from ""a fund consisting of all the money raised in the county of Hamilton by county tax for the support of idiots, lunatics and insane persons, and of such appropriations as shall be made by the state for the support of curable lunatics in said asylum, equal to the amount annually raised by taxation from the county of Hamilton for the support of lunatic asylums in the state."" An act of April 28, 1873, which repealed the provision of the act of 1857, and substituted in its place a law which provided that Hamilton county should receive, for the support of Longview Asylum, a sum which should bear such a proportion to the entire appropriations for the support of the curable insane of the state as the populations for the support of Hamilton county bears to the population of the state outside of said county.
The injustice of the law of 1873 has been so apparent that no General Assembly since 1880 has insisted on its enforcement. In the years 1880 to 1883, both inclusive, the legislature appropriated $10,000 each year in excess of the amount due under the statute of 1873. Since 1883 the legislature has wholly disregarded the rule of 1873, and has appropriated to Longview gross sums, in the same manner that appropriations were made to the other asylums.
Construction of new wards in the 1890s increased the capacity of the institution to 955. In 1927 the state took over the asylum and purchased more land and increased the capacity by 500. The asylum extended for 3 city blocks along Paddock Road encompassing about 300 acres. In the 1940s a medical building, a nurses home, and St. Dympha Chapel were completed. By 1953 the hospital had 3,568 patients and only 1,831 beds and was understaffed by 50%.
Starting in the 1950s the use of mood controlling drugs allowed many of the patients to live at home. Group homes, halfway houses, and nursing homes reduced the population to 401 in 1987. Operations have now been consolidated in the most modern portion of the complex and is now called the Pauline Warfield Lewis Center in 1984 to honor a long time advocate for the mentally ill.
The care of the insane in Hamilton county is an exception to the general system of the state, and for more than twenty years spasmodic efforts have been made on the part of the state to acquire the ownership and control of Longview, and to make it part of the state system, but to no practical end.

The Longview Hospital Cemetery was originally on the grounds of the hospital complex. The cemetery was used to bury patients who died indigent or whose bodies were unclaimed. According to a 1998 newspaper article on the cemetery, the cemetery has 1,160 grave plots laid out with the final grave marker being 870. The last burial was on 4 August 1967.

Ohio,Massillon State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Massillon_State_Hospital,1892,1893,1898,Active,Cottage Plan,,Massillon Psychiatric Center | Massillon State Hospital for the Insane | Eastern Ohio Insane Asylum  | Heartland Behavioral Health (Current),"On March 31, 1892, was passed a bill authorizing the appointment of a commission to select a site for a new institution as the Eastern Ohio Insane Asylum, now the Massillon State Hospital. The commission was appointed by Governor McKinley very shortly after the passage of the bill, and consisted of Dr. A. B. Richardson, Columbus; George R. Davis, Wapakoneta; and Dr. C. W. King, Dayton. This commission selected a site two miles south of Massillon, Stark county, Ohio, and on November 30th, same year, the Governor appointed a board of trustees, conform with the law establishing the institution. This building board consisted of Robert Sherrard, Jr., Steubenville; S. J. McMahon, Cambridge; Wm. H. Mullins, Salem; Dr. A. B. Richardson, Columbus; Dr. H. C. Eyman, Cleveland. Under the supervision of this building board a dining-room building, a kitchen and bakery building, a store house, a boiler house, a power house, a carpenter shop, a laundry building, a hospital building, an infirmary building, a superintendent's residence, a steward's residence and seven cottages were constructed.[1]
During William McKinley’s first term as the governor of Ohio, the city of Massillon was chosen for the very first state hospital in the United States and Canada in 1892 (the site was authorized in this same year). The construction of the hospital began in 1893 with the groundbreaking for McKinley Hall. This hall was built while William McKinley was governor, and was the first hall used to house mental patients. The hospital opened on September 6, 1898, housing 300 patients from 21 different counties.
Even though it holds the name of a “city” hospital, it was not really owned by Massillon itself. This is because there was no money collected from the city in taxes, and the “hospital supported entirely from the money received from patients for services rendered”. The hospital is both a member of the American and Ohio Hospital Associations and it functions through the Board of Trustees (consisting of nine local men).The hospital was originally the Eastern Ohio Mental Asylum, but was later changed to the Massillon State Hospital.
The McKinley Hall hospital was one of the most popular and “the most beautiful institution in the world”. By 1950, the hospital housed 3,100 patients with approximately 365 full and part time workers and nurses. The expanse of the land was so beautiful that many family picnics took place on the lawn, as well as the Massillon football and baseball games.
Under Dr. Hyde, the most popular superintendent of the hospital was very well liked and Judge John H. Lamneck said that Dr. Hyde “did more than any other single individual in Ohio for the mentally ill”.[2]
As philosophies for mental health treatment shifted by the mid-1970s, more than half of the patients were transferred to other facilities. The state hospital changed its name to Massillon Psychiatric Center and then to Heartland Behavioral Health Center, which remains its name today, with only a few hundred patients remain. Other community organizations and mental health agencies have stepped in to help and make services available to the community.
Apparently this was one of the first hospitals to be designed on the Cottage Plan.

A sanatorium, also called a sanitarium, is a resort for treatment of chronic diseases. MVDC started out as the Ohio State Sanatorium in 1925 to treat patients having tuberculosis. Treatment was for patients from the age of 7 on up. The hospital treated over 13,000 patients between 1909 & 1945. The Sanatorium changed it's name to Mount Vernon State Hospital in 1945, at that time it began to admit patients with mental illness & tuberculosis. In 1959 people with mental retardation/developmental disabilities without TB were transferred here. At that time the hospital began to admit and treat only patients without TB. On February 1, 1969 the Center's name changed to Mount Vernon State Institute for the Mentally Retarded, home to 492 individuals. On August 9, 1979 the Center was renamed Mount Vernon Developmental Center.
Today, the campus is over 300 acres, with 15 buildings of various sizes and a large underground utility and fiber optic network. It houses 222 residents ranging in age from 25 to 85.

The hospital was the first of its kind in the United States and the largest institution dedicated to the care of epileptics. The hospital opened on November 30, 1893. Originally, the hospital was to consist of thirty-six buildings. The administration buildings were to be in the center, with cottages for the patients encircling the other buildings. Each cottage was to hold fifty patients. As of 1901, the hospital consisted of an administration building, thirteen residence cottages, a laundry cottage, a schoolhouse, two vocational buildings, one kitchen, a cold house to store food, two dining rooms, one power plant, and a cottage for insane patients that could house two hundred people. All epileptics in Ohio were eligible for care at the hospital, however, the institution’s maximum capacity was 1,060 patients in 1901.
Prior to the creation of the Ohio Hospital for Epileptics, many epileptics, if their families were unable to care for them, resided in county poorhouses. In the hospital, the patients received medical care, adequate food and clothing, and an education. The Ohio Hospital for Epileptics closed in 1976. The hospitals buildings no longer exist, with the exception of two sandstone water towers, which inmates from the Ohio Penitentiary constructed for the hospital’s use. The towers are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1]

The grounds consist of 644 acres, and the Center properties cover approximately 60 acres on which are located 35 buildings.  The properties and facilities of Tiffin Developmental Center present the appearance of a college campus with its well-dispersed buildings, roadways, beautiful trees, lawns, and wooded picnic and recreation area.  Prior to 1944, when these properties were acquired by the State of Ohio, the grounds and many of the present buildings provided a home and educational facility for thousands of Junior Home “Kids”.
From 1944 to October 1975, this facility was known as the Tiffin State Hospital and served only mentally ill patients.  In October of 1975, a component of 124 people with mental retardation and/or developmental disabilities were brought to what is now known as Tiffin Developmental Center.  The facility now has 187 licensed beds to serve individuals with mental retardation and/or developmental disabilities.  The Center serves individuals from a fourteen county area of Northwest Ohio.
The overall objective of the Tiffin Developmental Center program is to provide multipurpose residential care and training services for people with mental retardation and/or developmental disabilities and acknowledges each individual’s capacity for learning, growing, and developing, regardless of his or her disability.  To this end, all staff and volunteer efforts are directed toward programming adequately for each individual.

Ohio,Toledo State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Toledo_State_Hospital,,1888,1888,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Toledo Insane Asylum,"Note: The Toledo Asylum for the Insane, 1888, was the first institution designed to the cottage plan system.
Designed by prominent Toledo architect, Edward O. Fallis, the Toledo Asylum for the Insane opened for occupancy in 1888, with Dr. Henry A. Tobey as superintendent. It was built on 150 acres of land located at the corner of Arlington and Detroit Avenues, and its design was based upon the cottage model which was a revolutionary concept at the time. There were thirty four buildings, twenty of which were pavilions or “cottages” that housed the “less extreme cases” of insane individuals, while six buildings--two infirm wards, two hospitals, and two strong wards--housed those considered more “critically insane” or “incurable.” The grounds also featured man-made lagoons, an administration building, a farm, an auditorium, a greenhouse, and a chapel. The maximum capacity of the entire project could house 1,800 patients.
The “cottage system,” as it became known, was conceived by General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, the founder of the Ohio State Archeological and Historical Society, who believed in abolishing the use of mechanical restraints in the treatment of the insane, and housing them in cottages to allow them the feelings of self-worth and independence while under the care of the state. The Mission Statement and Philosophy of the Asylum read, “To many the subject of caring for the insane is…a mystery. The secret of their care and keeping them contented is to have them lead as normal a life as possible, with good clean, healthy surroundings, plenty of nourishing food, and fresh air.”
The Asylum began moving patients off of the property in the early 1970s, and the buildings were destroyed in the early 1990s. Northwest Ohio Psychiatirc Hospital (NOPH), located on the same site, is the current treatment center and psychiatric hospital in Toledo and is owned and operated by the state of Ohio.

Located in Columbus, Ohio, the institution rented several buildings on East Main Street. In the first year of the Institution for Feeble Minded Youth’s existence, nine students enrolled. By the third year, the institution began to average between forty and fifty students every year.
Due to the institution’s success, the Ohio legislature authorized the construction of an actual campus for the school. Completed in 1868, the institution soon enrolled more than three hundred students. On November 18, 1881, a fire struck the school, destroying several of the buildings. The six hundred students escaped unharmed. The Institution for Feeble Minded Youth rebuilt the destroyed buildings and enrollment skyrocketed to 1,100 students in 1900. Eventually, the institution developed branches across Ohio.
The Institution for Feeble Minded Youth enrolled both boys and girls. These children struggled in the public schools of their own communities, and the institution gave the children a chance to enroll in a more supervised and stringent setting. The Institution for Feeble Minded Youth also provided the children with vocational training, with the boys working on a farm owned by the school and the girls performing domestic duties. This institution helped provide students with various learning and social problems the skills necessary to lead productive lives.[1]

Ohio,Gallipolis Epileptic Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Gallipolis_Epileptic_Hospital,"April 11, 1890","November 12, 1891","November 30, 1893",Demolished,Cottage Plan,,The Asylum for Epileptics and Epileptic Insane | The Ohio Hospital for Epileptics,"Between the determined efforts of the Board of State Charities of Ohio and the persistent individual endeavors of its members, the Ohio Hospital for epileptics at Gallipolis, Ohio was founded. It was the first of its kind in America, and the pioneer of all others in the world in having been owned and run by the state, and therefore from public revenues. The statistics obtained by the Board of State Charities and repeatedly presented to the different Legislatures, made it evident the prevalence of epilepsy within the state. It was shown that in 1890 there were 7000 epileptic residents in the state, a ratio of 1 epileptic for every 500 people living in the state. It was also shown that, while many were safely cared for by relatives, others were at large, distressing their neighbors, or were crowded in insane hospitals, infirmaries and jails, creating conditions and environments unsuited and unjust to the epileptics to be properly cared for. Plus their presence within these institutions were detrimental to the care of the other residents also residing in these places.
Prompted by the investigations and recommendations of the Board of State Charities, the General Assembly passed an act, April 11, 1890, creating a commission empowered to investigate and determine the best possible methods of caring for the epileptic and epileptic insane; to adopt plans in accordance with this object, and to select a site for such an asylum accommodating 1000 patients. The members of the commission, Col. John L. Vance, C. C. Wait and C. F. Bonnell, visited and duly considered the various locations offered, and decided that the one at Gallipolis, Ohio, combined the greatest number of advantages.
The site consists of a natural plateau, above flood stage of the Ohio River, perfectly drained, and splendidly protected by the surrounding hills. At the rear are beautifully wooded hills containing valuable coal and stone deposits, while in front the site overlooks the Ohio River and its narrow valley, which separates it from the rugged hills of West Virginia. After considering the natural advantages of the proposed site as regarded healthfulness, drainage and protection, the ease with which a water system could be installed, the fact that practically no grading would be necessary, the presence of excellent building stone, sand, gravel and coal within its borders, the commission recommended it as an ideal location for an asylum.
The commission consulted the foremost neurologists and alienists, at home and abroad, especially those experienced in the treatment of epilepsy, and submitted plans for the construction of 36 buildings for the segregation of epileptics in classified colonies, after the method of the Bielefeld Colony in Germany, as the best adapted for the welfare and treatment of those affected with epilepsy. Later, in further compliance with the act creating the commission, a Board of Trustees was appointed, who approved the plans and let contracts for the erection of the asylum.
The first appropriation for $40,000 was passed March 4, 1891, with which three stone residence buildings were begun, the cornerstone of the first being laid November 12, 1891, with appropriate ceremonials. In 1892 the General Assembly passed an act changing the name of the institution from "" The Asylum for Epileptics and Epileptic Insane "" to "" The Ohio Hospital for Epileptics."" The three cottages begun in 1891 were completed and opened :orthereception of patients November 30, 1893. Dr. H. C. Rutter, an alienist of reputation, was appointed superintendent, and under his skillful management the hospital made rapid progress.
In November, 1894, there were 351 patients, nine stone residence cottages, a kitchen and bakery building and boiler house completed, ind a dining room and two cottages in course of construction, at aggregate cost of $376,341. Since 1894 the institution has had J steady growth. The acreage has been increased to 459 acres, <bont one-third of which is in farm land, and buildings have been tdded until the hospital now consists of 42 buildings, exclusive of small structures. The buildings are divided into five main groups, consisting of the administrative group, the east group, the west group, the insane wards and the farm group. The administrative group consists of the administration building, two congregate dining rooms, two industrial buildings, power, heating and lighting plant, ice plant, kitchen and bakery, and cold storage.
The east group consists of 13 cottages containing 15 wards for 805 male patients and is subdivided into an inner colony accommodating those patients evidencing the advance of dementia and those needing hospital or custodial care, and an outer colony for those patients who have a better mental and social status; who crave more homelike surroundings and greater privacy, and in whom the benefits of such surroundings would favor their contentment and possible recovery. The west group consists of 10 cottages containing 12 wards accommodating 670 female patients, and is also subdivided into inner and outer colonies, corresponding in classification to those of the east group. The north group, removed one-half mile from other residence cottages, accommodates 200 insane; 100 of each sex.
The farm group, about one-half mile from the other group, is a substantial cottage, colonizing 32 epileptic males, who, other than their epilepsy, are healthy and render valuable service as farm laborers. Nearby is the dairy, a comparatively new acquisition, which offers a proper occupation to many patients. In addition to the dairy proper, there is a residence for the dairyman and swineherd, a residence for other employees, a storage house, a storage barn for feed and agricultural machinery, silos, horse barns, exclusive of shelter for cattle, poultry and swine.
The estimated value of the whole plant is $1,000,000. There have been five superintendents of the hospital in the course of its existence, who have presided over its affairs for varying lengths of service: Dr. H. C. Rutter, from August, 1893, to August, 1901 Dr. W. K. Coleman, from September, 1901, to May, 1902; Dr. A. P. Ohlmacher, from July, 1902, to February, 1903; Dr. W. H Pritchard, from February, 1903, to May, 1911; Dr. G. G. Kineon from May, 1911, to present time.
Twenty-three physicians have had the medical care of patient; and otherwise assisted the management, their length of service varying from one to eight years.
Until August 15, 1911, the hospital had been controlled by a board of five trustees appointed by the Governor for terms o: from one to four years. By an act of the Legislature of 1910-11 this board was abolished, and a Central Board of Administration created having control of all state benevolent institutions.
As of April 1912 there was an enrollment of 1475 patients with a daily average of 1421 present; including officers and administrative assistants, there are 236 employees variously in charge of patients and work. The institution is filled to its capacity and further crowding would create unhygienic conditions. A plan for the erection of additional buildings should be adopted, as it would be an economical measure to provide for those epileptics now confined in insane hospitals of the state, as well as those on the waiting list of the hospital.
The colonization plan, in the light of past experience, is more than ever to be commended, as being the ideal one in the modern care of epileptics. The patients are for the most part contented and acquiesce readily and cheerfully to any reasonable disciplinary regimen, and sympathy prevails between officers, employees and patients. Improved methods of preparation of food are used; a suitable diet is furnished; a reasonable amount of work is required, and amusements and recreation are encouraged and supplied.
As the institution grows in years and numbers, the number annually discharged as recovered becomes fewer, owing to the fact that the hospital has no longer selected cases alone to deal with; that many of those longest on the hospital register have progressed to an epileptic dementia, the final goal to which epilepsy tends; that many cases previously discharged were those in which correct methods of living had resulted in a temporary cessation of attacks, or were questionable cases of idiopathic epilepsy and should have been classified as hysteria, malingering, renal or cardiac affections or functional or organic changes in the nervous system with epileptic seizures.
At the inception of the institution those most closely interested in it, as well as the medical profession in general, and most of all, the unfortunate epileptic people of the state, were optimistic of the benefits which were to follow and with reason. It was hoped that the opportunity for observation and careful, painstaking examination of the epileptic under all circumstances might result in discovering a cause for this obscure disease and suggesting methods for combating it. To this end Dr. C. H. Clark and Dr. Richard O'Connell were appointed to the medical staff to direct the medical work, and Dr. B. M. Bolton, associate professor of bacteriology of Johns Hopkins University, was placed in charge of the laboratory to cooperate with the physicians. Later Dr. Bliele, of the Ohio State University, assumed the directorship of the laboratory and much valuable work was done on the excreta of epileptics. No definite variations in the proportion of urinary constituents symptomatic of epilepsy were found, but from the excreta following seizures a body or bodies were obtained which, when administered to animals in small quantities, produced convulsive seizures.
Dr. A. P. Ohlmacher succeeded Dr. Bliele and did much valuable original research work, especially on the thymus and lymphatic glands. His painstaking histologic studies and investigations of the pathological anatomy of epilepsy have been valuable contributions to the literature of the subject, but have not suggested profitable avenues of study or treatment.
By an act of the Legislature $5000 was appropriated for the investigation and study of epilepsy. For many reasons the work was not taken up as soon as the funds became available, but in the following year new equipment was added and the laboratory placed under the non-resident directorship of Dr. Walter H. Buhlig, of Northwestern University, of Chicago, with Dr. Mary L. Austin, of the hospital staff, in immediate charge. The problem undertaken was a study of metabolism in epileptics, beginning with nitrogenous metabolism in selected groups of similar ages. The work has been carefully done on several groups, but until all have been covered it is undesirable to draw conclusions. Incidental to the above work a substance resembling pentose was found with moderate frequency in the urines, which may prove to bear a causal relation to epilepsy. At all times the laboratory is in use for clinical and diagnostic purposes, and to this availability and the vigilance of the staff is due the fact that epidemics and contagious diseases in general are practically unknown in the institution. The mortality reports show that death is due in the large majority of cases to epilepsy and its legitimate sequel.
New and old treatments have been given careful consideration Bromides are given more than any other one remedy, but by nc means in all cases. Dietary measures, hydrotherapy, crotalin calcium lactate, venesections, salvarsan, intraspinal administration of sodium and magnesium salts have failed or at best have resulted only in an improvement, and very rarely in even an apparent cure[1]
The Ohio Hospital for Epileptics closed in 1976. The hospitals buildings no longer exist, with the exception of two sandstone water towers, which inmates from the Ohio Penitentiary constructed for the hospital’s use. The towers are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Brecksville V.A. Hospital opened in 1961. The 102-acre ""campus"" on Brecksville Road included 16 buildings and offered such amenities as a swimming pool, a 6-lane bowling alley, a baseball field, a gym, a theater, a chapel, and at one time, a fishing pond. Hospital staff navigated the corridors connecting the buildings in electric carts called widgets. The facility became nationally recognized for its role in pioneering treatment of gambling addiction, substance abuse and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
In 1971, after operating as separate facilities, each with its own budget and director, the Brecksville and Wade Park hospitals merged. Surgical patients in Brecksville were transferred to Wade Park; neurological/psychiatric patients from Wade Park were transferred to Brecksville. In 1999, the Wade Park facility was renamed the Louis Stokes Cleveland V.A. Medical Center in honor of the former U.S. Congressman.
A decision was made in 2004 to consolidate all patient care at the Stokes Cleveland V.A. Medical Center, saving the V.A. about $23 million per year. In preparation for the consolidation, Stokes Cleveland was renovated and an additional 222-bed tower, administrative office building, a 122-bed homeless domicile and a parking garage were constructed on the campus.

Ohio,Broadview Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Broadview_VA_Hospital,,,1939,Demolished,Single Building,,Broadview Veterans Administration Hospital,"In the 1930s, a grand hospital was built by the Federal Government. It opened in 1939 and was called the Broadview VA hospital. It provided general medical and surgical services to veterans. After the war, all patients were moved to Crile Hospital and the building was used for Tuberculosis patients. In the late 1940s the building became too small for TB patients. Another wing was built east off the back of the original building.
August of 1961, Brecksville VA Hospital opened on Miller Road and Route 21. It was associated with Wade Park VA Hospital which opened in June 1964, taking in all patients from Crile Hospital which was sold to Cuyahoga Community College. A mixture of patients in the old building were relocated.
In 1965 the property was sold to the State of Ohio for $1 to be used for mentally handicapped patients. Several additional buildings were constructed on the property for housing. In 1972 the Thorin Building (now known as the Community Building) opened for offices, classrooms, and recreation.
In 1987 the State closed the old hospital building and all clients were housed in cottages. Then in 1992 the State moved out of the Broadview Developmental Center altogether. Several of the outlying buildings continued to house patients through a private operator.
In 1995 the General Assembly voted to sell Broadview Developmental Center to the City of Broadview Heights; it became official in 1996 when the City purchased the 68-acre property for $750,000. In 1998 the Recreation and Human Services Departments moved into the Thorin Building at the newly-renamed ""Broadview Center"". The Thorin Building underwent extensive renovation, and in 1999 City Hall moved into what is now called ""The Community Building"".
One of the outlying cottages was renovated for the Police Department which moved to the Broadview Center in 2000. The Service Department renovated and moved into the former Dietary Building and the steam power house was demolished. Buildings 9, 10, and 11 were also renovated for use by the Service Department. A new service garage and salt bin were constructed in 2003, then a skatepark in 2004. Other outlying buildings soon housed various organizations including the community theater, photo club, garden club, historical society, Lend-a-Hand, etc.
The old hospital was demolished in 2006. A playground was built in 2007, football field in 2009, and a pavilion in 2011. The grounds of the Broadview Center continue to change with the needs of the community.",1966 (VA)/1993,"Broadview Heights, OH",,,1939,1992,,,,0
Ohio,Dayton VA Medical Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dayton_VA_Medical_Center,1865,,1867,Active,Cottage Plan,Thomas Budd Van Horne,"Dayton National Asylum | National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Central Branch | National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers | Col. Edwin Brown Hospital","In March 1865, President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill to provide care for volunteer soldiers who were disabled through loss of limb, wounds, disease, or injury during service in the Union forces during the Civil War. Initially called the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, the name was later changed to the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers because of the negative connotation of the word ""asylum."" The first three homes opened in Togus, Maine; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Dayton, Ohio. Eventually, there were 11 National Home branches across the country. Requirements for admission were that soldiers had been honorably discharged from military service and that they had contracted their disabilities during the war. Men admitted themselves to the home voluntarily and could request a discharge. The homes were run in a military fashion: men wore uniforms and were assigned to companies; bugles and cannons signaled daily schedules. The homes provided schools, churches, hospitals, and gardens thought to be therapeutic for the veterans.
In 1867, the government purchased land and began construction on the Central Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Dayton. By 1868, the Central Branch was equipped to care for 1000 disabled soldiers. As the campus grew, it eventually covered 627 acres, complete with living quarters, hospital, library, and chapel. It was constructed in part using lumber recycled from the nearby Camp Chase where Confederate POWs had been confined. By 1884, the Dayton Soldiers' Home, as it became known, had become the largest of its kind in operation, accounting for 64% of the veterans receiving U.S. government institutional care. Dayton's veteran population reflected the diversity found in the Union Army, including black veterans, who the Dayton Home was the first federal institution to admit. More than 200,000 African-American soldiers and sailors served in the Union military, and many went on to serve on cemetery details after fighting ceased. The Dayton Home was progressive in other ways, as well. It operated according to the philosophy that exercise, reading, music, healthcare, and occupational training in preparation for reentering society-all taking place in a picturesque environment-would improve the health and well-being of the veterans under its care. Modern innovations included steam heat, indoor plumbing, and elevators.
Ten years after its founding, by 1877, the facility had been transformed into a city with 132 buildings, many of which had running water, steam heat and gas lighting. There were six and one-half miles of road, two miles of gravel walkway, many wells and four lakes. The facility also boasted a 250 acre farm which provided much of the produce consumed by the patients.
In July 1930, the National Soldiers Home system was dismantled and consolidated into the newly formed Veterans Administration. A new hospital, Col. Edwin Brown Hospital, named for an early administrator of the site, was dedicated in 1931 replacing the old Home Hospital. An extensive construction program resulted from the depression and the government program of public works. Many of the frame and brick buildings dating from the earliest years of the Central Branch were razed to make way for a new mess hall, and new domiciliary buildings. Among the changes, the old snorers barracks, used to accommodate ""loud sleepers"" disappeared. Patrick Hospital, originally built in 1940 as a domiciliary, was converted to a geriatric hospital in 1950. The Dayton VA Medical Center was among the early Veterans Administration providers of nursing home care as mandated by an executive order signed by President John Kennedy.
Since 1974, the Dayton VA Medical Center has been affiliated with the Wright State University School of Medicine. The VA currently serves as the principal teaching hospital for Wright State University's Department of Medicine and as a major contributor for the Departments of Surgery, Dermatology, and Neurology. The VA is also affiliated with the University of Cincinnati for residency training in Psychiatry.
In 1989, the Veterans Administration was yet again re-named and restructured by presidential action. Today, the Dayton VA Medical Center is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and provides care for veterans in a multi-county area of Ohio and Indiana. The Medical Center is located on over 300 acres of land and the facility includes a general medical, surgical and psychiatric hospital; a nursing home; and domiciliary. Comprehensive medical programs in medicine, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, rehabilitative medicine and dentistry are available to today's veterans. [1]",,"Dayton, OH",,,1867,,,,1000,0
Ohio,Boys Industrial School at Lancaster,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Boys_Industrial_School_at_Lancaster,1856,,1858,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Fairfield School for Boys | Southeastern Correctional Facility,"The establishment of the Ohio Reform Farm (or School) was authorized by the Ohio General Assembly on April 7, 1856. A law enacted April 17, 1857, outlined in detail the organization of the institution. Located on 1,170 acres five miles south of Lancaster, Ohio, the Ohio Reform Farm was the first institution in the United States to be operated on the cottage or ""family"" plan rather than the ""big-house"" system. Each ""family"" of 40 boys, who ranged in age from ten to eighteen, was supervised by an “Elder Brother.” The Boys Industrial School was governed by a Board of Commissioners until 1911. At that time, control was given to the newly created Ohio Board of Administration, which in turn created a Bureau of Juvenile Research in 1913 to “test, examine, and evaluate delinquent juveniles entrusted to its care.”
In 1921, this bureau was transferred to the Ohio Department of Public Welfare. The Ohio Department of Mental Hygiene and Correction began overseeing the Boys’ Industrial School in 1954. In 1963, the Ohio Youth Commission was created and assumed control of the Boys' Industrial School. Comedian Bob Hope spent some time at the Boy's Industrial School as a child. As an adult, Hope donated sizable sums of money to the institution. The institution ceased to operate as a juvenile reformatory in July 1980. The campus was converted to a medium security prison (Southeastern Correctional Institution) for adult offenders under the supervision of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.",1980 (as a Juvenile Center),"Lancaster, OH",,,1857,1980,,,,0

Many legislators feared that placing juvenile criminals in prisons with adult offenders would further corrupt the youth. The institution was located on the grounds of the former White Sulphur Springs, a resort established in 1847. Many people believed that water from the spring had medicinal qualities. On February 24, 1874, a fire destroyed several of the buildings, but the State of Ohio rebuilt the destroyed structures and, over the years, added several additional buildings.
In 1901, the Girls' Industrial Home consisted of a 189-acre farm on the west bank of the Scioto River. Eleven buildings comprised the Girls' Industrial Home at this point, including an administration building, a school building, a hospital, and eight cottages to house the inmates. Each cottage held between forty and fifty girls.
C.M. Ginther of the Dayton News wrote in 1920 that: “When the school was established fifty-one years ago, its purpose was misunderstood. Its founders had a definite aim, but, unhappily, the public obtained a perverted notion about it. The idea gained credence that it was a place of punishment where girls from 8 to 21 years of age were incarcerated for disobedience or wilfulness. Apparently no shred of the truth reached the public mind that it was a school in which the best theories of modern education were followed. Girls admitted to the place were, by the very fact, ostracized and given a character which bordered on depravity. When they left the school the public regarded them with suspicion.”  And, yet, the very next year, the school was officially described as a place for “the instruction, employment and reformation of evil-disposed, incorrigible, and vicious girls.”",,"Delaware, OH",,,1869,,,,,1
Ohio,Cincinnati Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cincinnati_Sanitarium,1873,,1873,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The Cincinnati Sanitarium was located in the College Hill neighborhood. Three doctors established the Sanitarium because they saw a need for a private care psychiatric facility. The 32-acre property was purchased from the Ohio Female College in 1873. Patients were treated for mental illness as well as alcohol and opium addictions. In addition to the main hospital, there were four two-story cottages, an amusement hall with a billiard hall in the basement, a flower conservatory, several physical plant buildings, an ice house and even a station for the Cincinnati Northwestern railroad.
In 1913 a nearby large residence adjacent to the property was purchased. Called the “Rest Cottage”, it was used in the care of individuals with “nervous and nutritional disorders”. The buildings were situated in the middle of a 30-acre park with fruit trees, shrubs, flowers, an artificial lake, gravel walks, a highly cultivated vegetable garden and a living spring. A major change in the landscape occurred in 1927 when the lake was drained.
By 1956, the Cincinnati Sanitarium was renamed for Emerson Arthur North, MD, a pioneer in clinical psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati. The 95-bed psychiatric hospital specialized in serving adults, adolescents and children in need of treatment for behavioral, emotional and chemical dependency problems. During the 1960s and early 70s, Emerson A. North Hospital became part of the Cincinnati Mental Health Institute, serving as the inpatient component of the community mental health centers. A new facility was built in 1988 (Phoenix International). The hospital closed in 1994 when its services moved to Providence Hospital in Mt. Airy. In 1994 the campus was occupied for six years by Phoenix International, a company that conducted clinical trails of drugs for the pharmaceutical industry. The clinic closed after it was sold to another company and operations were consolidated.
Today the property is home to the Cincinnati Children's College Hill Campus, a hospital that treats mental illness for children and adolescents.",1956,"Cincinnati, OH",,,1873,1994,95,,,0

Ohio,Oxford Retreat,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oxford_Retreat,,1856,1882,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The building was created in 1856 as the home of the Oxford Female College. In June 1867, Oxford Female College and Oxford Female Institute united under the name Oxford Female College. The school moved into the building of the Oxford Female Institute at the southwest corner of High Street and College Avenue. The building of the Oxford Female College then briefly was a United Presbyterian academy, before being sold in 1882 to Dr. D.A. Morse, previously superintendent of the Dayton Asylum for the Insane (1878-1880), and Dr. George F. Cook.  The two doctors created the trust company called the Oxford Retreat.
The Retreat opened its doors to 17 clients its first year. But first the building received some modifications to its structure in order to provide an adequate living space for its patients.  At 155 feet by 171 feet, the old college building was already set up to house up to 100 patients. Upon its being sold to Dr. D.A.  Morse, the Hamilton Telegraph(1) discussed the living arrangements “well ventilated,” and spacious and ample grounds.
The first floor housed those patients “nearly ready to be discharged, and those troubled with other diseases than those of the brain”, according to as description in the Oxford Citizen.(2) These rooms were filled with handsome furniture in order to make the patients more comfortable. The second floor was used for the less treatable cases, the north and east wing for the violent ones, with the men in the north side, and the women housed in the east side. The first year the third floor of the building was not used.
There were two large fires at “the Pines,” which was the building adjoining the Retreat; both times the building burnt down to the ground. The first fire occurred in 1913. After its initial burning, the Oxford Retreat built “the Pines” back up and used it as a place for “nervous women,” and kept the patients with more severe problems in the main building. In 1924, another fire occurred. On June 14th, 1925, two days after the fire at “the Pines”, the Miami University Board finance committee authorized the arrangements to purchase the Oxford Retreat property.  Authority was given to this committee and the building committee to remodel and change the Retreat building as deemed necessary.
After the university took over the main building it was called Fisher Hall and used as a residence hall. The sanitarium moved to “the Pines” and continued to operate there until 1936. At that time the hospital went out of business and the university turned the building into a female dorm for students. In 1979 the main building (Fisher Hall) was no longer used by the university and demolished despite attempts to save it. The Pines, now named Wilson Hall, continues to be used as a residence hall for Miami University.",,"Oxford, OH (campus of Miami University)",,,1882,1936,100,17,,0

It was for the incurably ill and the elderly. The building sits on 10 hillside acres that had been a cemetery. The cemetery had been placed under interdict in 1849 because of violations of canon law by its directors. The trustees of the German Catholic Cemetery Association was selling plots to persons ""not in communion with the Church."" They did this probably because of financial problems. Thus when Archbishop Purcell laid the cemetery under interdict it meant the land was no longer consecrated.. The graves were moved to the St. Joseph Cemetery in Price Hill and the land was donated to the Franciscan Sisters. A $25,000 bequest from Reuben Springer (1800-1884) enabled the Sisters to begin construction.
The first patient was admitted on January 2, 1889. By 1938  the hospital had cared for 41,000 patients, 85% of whom had been unable to pay. It was the only hospital west of the Alleghenies in those days with facilities for treating cancer. By the 1970s it was obvious the hospital was becoming obsolete and it was closed in 1981.

Ohio,Windsor Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Windsor_Hospital,1898,1844,1927,Closed,Single Building,,Prospect Sanitarium,"Windsor Hospital was a 71-bed not-for-profit hospital for the treatment of acute neuropsychiatric disorders and chemical dependency in adolescents and adults. Windsor Hospital was founded in 1898 by Dr. Christian Sihler, a neurologist and the first chief of staff at Lutheran Hospital to treat convalescents, mainly those with minor nerve disorders requiring isolation and rest. The hospital took its name from its original site on Windsor Ave. (later Chester Ave.) in Cleveland. The hospital incorporated as a nonprofit corporation in 1956 with a board of 3 trustees, later increased to 4. In 1938 Windsor Hospital moved to a fireproof building on Prospect Ave., where it was renamed Prospect Sanitarium. This facility closed in 1942. In 1927 a second site had been purchased in Chagrin Falls. Known as Linden Hall, it offered postoperative care; it closed shortly after the stock market crash in 1929. It reopened in 1932 as Windsor Hospital 2 under a third brother, Edmund Sihler.
In its early years, Windsor used hydrotherapy to treat first typhoid fever and nervous disorders, then psychiatric patients. In the 1920s and 1930s, the hospital in Cleveland cared largely for state psychiatric patients as a result of an overflow from state mental hospitals, while the hospital in Chagrin Falls treated mainly private patients. This emphasis on private patients continued in Chagrin Falls after the closing of the Cleveland facility. From the 1950s, Windsor Hospital experienced a steady shift to short-term care. In the 1980s it implemented a developmental school (for adolescents) and increasingly emphasized the treatment of chemical dependency. In the early 1980s, St. Luke's Medical Center, in partnership with Windsor, proposed to build a $20 million, 143-bed hospital on the Windsor Hospital site. The plan was dropped in 1984 because of a downturn in the local hospital industry. The hospital manager in 1994 was David G. Blackburn and the hospital was owned by Mental Health Management of McLean, VA.
The Windsor complex in Chagrin Falls operated for 78 years until closing permanently in 2005. The entire property was purchased in 2007 by a developer, and again sold in 2012 to a couple who made numerous renovations. The structure was then left to continue to fall into further disrepair, and the city looked to demolish it since no buyers were stepping up.  In 2013, the structure was brought back to life when Auburn-based developer Robert Micco signed a purchase agreement to buy the 21-acre property. In partnership with Gary Spaeth  of Manorbrook Homes Inc. they built 32 homes on the property. The home now sits in front of the neighborhood, which sits along Falls Walk Way and Pear Tree Circle.",2005,"Cleveland, OH",Greek Revival,,1898,2005,71,,,0
Ohio,Woodruff Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Woodruff_Hospital,,,1935,Demolished,Single Building,,Ingleside Hospital,"The Woodruff Foundation traces its history to the opening of a mental health hospital in 1935 by Mabel A. Woodruff, a World War I Army nurse who became a psychiatric social worker. Appalled by conditions in existing mental health care facilities, she borrowed $800 on her own life insurance, and with funds from friends and supporters, founded a private institution in Cleveland where ""one could obtain good care, good food and kindness at the lowest possible cost"".
Ms. Woodruff opened her hospital in the old Higbee mansion on Cleveland’s Ingleside Avenue. It was first called the Ingleside Hospital and retained that name when it moved to the former Severance mansion at 8821 Euclid Avenue in 1937. Shortly after Ms. Woodruff died in 1963, the hospital was renamed in her honor.
By 1968, Woodruff Hospital had increased its capacity from 40 beds to 98 beds and had built a modern facility on East 89th Street, which became the largest private psychiatric hospital in northeast Ohio. It reopened in 1969, renamed Woodruff Memorial Institute in honor of its founder. It specialized in alcoholism, drug dependency, and adolescent programs. In 1986 Woodruff Hospital closed, and its programs were transferred to St. Vincent Charity Hospital & Health Center.

Ohio,Cooley Farms,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cleveland_City_Hospital_Tuberculosis_Sanitarium,1909,,1912,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Warrensville House of Correction | Highland View Hospital | Cuyahoga Chronic Hospital | Cleveland Workhouse | Sunny Acres Sanitarium | Warrensville Sanitarium | Cleveland City Hospital Tuberculosis Sanitarium,"In his ongoing fight against people of privilege and on behalf of the ""common man,"" Tom Johnson found a friend and soulmate in his church pastor, Harris R. Cooley. Three years younger than Johnson, Cooley was born in Royalton, Ohio on October 18, 1857. His father was Lathrop Cooley, a well-known minister in the Disciples of Christ church. He was active in various ministries in the Western Reserve for six decades, and he imparted to his son a sense of duty and obligation to the less fortunate members of society. The elder Cooley preached at the city workhouse, the city jail, and the Aged Women's Home, and he served as superintendent and chaplain of the Cleveland Bethel Union, a seaman's mission involved in work-relief programs.
Cooley's son Harris trained for the ministry at Hiram and Oberlin colleges and served as pastor in several Cleveland and northeast Ohio churches. At Cleveland's Cedar Avenue Christian Church he befriended Tom Johnson, and the two men soon found that they shared strongly held beliefs about social justice and economic and political equality.
One of those shared beliefs concerned the causes of criminal activity. Cooley and Johnson, like most Progressives, believed that the physical setting in which people lived actually influenced whether they would engage in criminal activity. The city itself— especially the run-down industrial districts and the neighborhoods where industrial workers lived -- bred crime like a swamp breeds mosquitoes. A collateral problem was the disease and disability often found in these places. Both Cooley and his friend the mayor believed that humane treatment, both of the ill and of the criminally inclined, was essential to the recovery of both and that removal from the city setting was the appropriate way to achieve this goal. The city's citizens would regain physical and social health by being removed from the city — an anti-urban attitude that shaped much of American social and economic policy during the 20th century.
Immediately upon taking office as mayor, Johnson appointed Cooley as Director of Charities and Corrections for the City of Cleveland. Cooley held this post for ten years, into the administration of Mayor Newton D. Baker. Acting on his theory that the crowding, dirt, noise, and other negative aspects of urban life militated against public health and healthy lifestyles, upon his appointment to his city post Cooley began to develop the idea of a rural campus, ""wholesome surroundings"" in which the city's charges could be cared for without the evils of the city intruding. Mayor Johnson gave Cooley his vigorous support, and acquisition of land began in 1904. The location was in Warrensville Township, some 10 miles southeast of downtown Cleveland, on a high tract of rolling rural land. The city had already begun acquiring land here in 1902 for a cemetery and between 1904 and 1912 acquired some 25 farms at a total cost of $350,000. The complex eventually totaled 2,000 acres, located primarily between Northfield and Richmond roads (which ran north-south) and on either side of Harvard Road (which ran east-west).
Cooley himself expressed the purpose of the new facility in terms which summed up his philosophy and his attitude toward his fellow man -- terms which might be considered softhearted and romantic by some but which went to the core beliefs of this unusual public official. Speaking of the indigent and the delinquent in particular, Cooley said:
“They have made the human voyage. Among the unfortunates are some who have been wasteful, intemperate, and vicious. Some are undeserving, some have done wrong, but these things are true of some of the children of luxury.”
The entire complex became known as Cooley Farms and became widely known for its progressive approach toward the people in its care. Consistent with Cooley's and the mayor's ideas about crime, the complex also included a correctional facility for rehabilitation of lawbreakers. Attitudes of the time held that negative influences of the urban setting contributed to crime and vice and that removal of offenders from that environment was essential to their ""correction."" The Cleveland Workhouse was first established in 1855 on the Scranton Road site near the city's hospital and infirmary. It moved in 1871 to a site on Woodland Avenue at East 79th Street, and in 1912 it became part of Cooley Farms.
There were four components of Cooley Farms, all of which were in place by the period just before World War I. They included Colony Farm, which was the city infirmary/poorhouse, which also included a halfway house and cottages for elderly couples; Highland Park Farm, the city cemetery; Overlook Farm, a tuberculosis sanatorium; and Correction Farm, the city workhouse and house of corrections. The first two were north of Harvard Road, the cemetery in the northwest quadrant and Colony Farm in the northeast quadrant. The other two were south of Harvard, the Correction Farm in the southwest quadrant and Overlook Farm in the southeast. Each of the four occupied about 500 acres.
Adoption of the name ""Farms"" was not just to commemorate the original use of the land. Social philosophy of the time held that productive work was important in rehabilitating people of all kinds, from the aged and ill to the poor and the criminal. Thus the Cooley Farms complex was set up as a working farm, nearly self-sufficient, where everyone was expected to work according his physical and mental ability. Workhouse inmates did the heaviest work, which included operation of a quarry for building stone and cement production. They worked at the facility's dairy, piggery, greenhouse, blacksmith shop, sawmill and cannery. Farm work included vegetable and feed production and an orchard. Workhouse inmates also maintained the grounds of the entire complex and worked on construction of many of the buildings. Able-bodied residents of the other ""farms"" also worked, mainly at lighter tasks. The entire Cooley Farms complex was considered a model for progressive treatment of social ills, the workhouse in particular. Social and economic journals of the day devoted considerable space to studies of the complex, and the Cleveland facility inspired similar efforts in Toledo and in two cases in New York City, the Farm Colony on Staten Island and the 1930s Camp LaGuardia in rural Orange County, intended for derelicts from the Bowery.
The workhouse at Correction Farm, completed in 1912, was also called the Cooley Farms Workhouse and the Cleveland House of Corrections. A women's wing was added in 1913, and a separate boiler house was part of the original construction. The architect was J. Milton Dyer, a major Cleveland architect who had to his credit such important structures as Cleveland City Hall, the Peerless Motor Car Company, and the U.S. Coast Guard Station. The buildings employed a restrained Spanish Colonial Revival style, represented primarily by their red clay tile hip roofs and stuccoed walls. They were replaced by new facilities in the mid-1980s, and no historic structures survive at the site today.
Overlook Farm, the tuberculosis sanatorium, was first located in the Robert J. Walkden house, one of the farmhouses acquired by the city when it was making land purchases for Cooley Farms. Located on the west side of Richmond Readjust north of Harvard Road, the house served from 1906 until completion of the main sanatorium in 1913. The Walkden house was an 1870 Italianate building of brick construction. It had been unused and was in a state of deterioration at the time it was destroyed by fire in 1982.
The 1913 sanatorium was known as both Sunny Acres Sanatorium and Sunny Acres Hospital (exposure to sunlight was at one time thought to help cure tuberculosis). Both the main building and a 1931 addition were designed in a simplified Mission Revival style, which complemented the Spanish Colonial Revival elements of the Cleveland Workhouse and the Colony Farm. The 1913 building was designed by Herman Kregelius, and the 1931 addition was designed by George S. Ryder. The original facility, and its 1931 addition, survived into the late 1970s, when they were demolished for a new facility, which still serves as part of the county's health care system as a long-term skilled nursing facility. No historic structures remain at the Sunny Acres site today.
The principal buildings of the Colony Farm, which was the replacement for the old City Infirmary at the Scranton Road site near downtown, were completed between 1909 and 1912.
Other later structures, discussed below, expanded the complex, and a large new main hospital building was built in the early 1950s after the complex was transferred to Cuyahoga County. It was about this time that the complex became known as Highland View Hospital. The sit was on the north side of Harvard Road west of Richmond Road.
The original complex included eight buildings: the Old Couples' Cottage, the Female Insane Cottage, the North Dormitory, the Administration Building, the Quadrangle, the Power House, the South Dormitory, and the Male Insane Cottage. The design of the complex was the work of J. Milton Dyer, architect of the workhouse. The symmetry of the complex indicated the formality of the Beaux-Arts design Dyer originally proposed, which was abandoned in favor of the modest Spanish Mission-influenced design ultimately built.
The complex at its peak had fifteen separate structures and today consists of nine standing buildings and one set of ruins. Four of the buildings standing on the site were listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 8, 1979, including original Colony Farm buildings known today as Sweeney Hall, Bingham Hall, the Quadrangle Building, and Carter Hall; the nomination was prepared by the Cuyahoga County Archives and was called ""Cooley Farms Group."" The nomination also included the Cleveland House of Corrections, the House of Corrections Boiler House, and the Robert J. Walkden House. As was noted above, all of these buildings have been demolished.
The combined Sanborn maps of 1926-51/1953-61 give a picture of the hospital complex when it had reached its greatest size. From north to south, the principal buildings by the late 1950s included the following:
Other surviving elements of the site include concrete walks, paved drives and parking areas, and portions of former tunnels and covered passageways that provided all-weather access between some buildings. There are numerous trees and shrubs, many of which obviously were part of the site's landscaping; others have grown up since the property was abandoned in the early 1980s.
Under the county's administration, Highland View Hospital became well known for its care of chronically ill patients, specializing in treating the chronically disabled, stroke victims, and patients with neuro-muscular diseases. In 1957-58 the Cuyahoga County Hospital system was established and was credited with being the nation's first county-run public hospital system. Highland View and City Hospital (now MetroHealth Medical Center, at the original Scranton Road location) were the system's two principal units.
Between 1969 and 1973, the county began a move to phase out Highland View in favor of MetroGeneral Hospital at the location near downtown Cleveland. This decision apparently was made for financial reasons, to cut the cost necessary to run two large hospital complexes. By 1978 the last of Highland View's patients was transferred to MetroGeneral. Other than use of two wings of the Main Building in the early 1980s as an alcoholism treatment center, the buildings at Highland View were never used again. The site was proposed for redevelopment during the 1980s by a local industrialist, but these plans never materialized. More recently, the property has been transferred to a Cleveland developer and is proposed for long-term commercial development.
Back near downtown Cleveland, after removal of the non-medical functions to Cooley Farms by the period just before World War I, City Hospital continued to operate in both the 1889 structure and in the former infirmary building. A tuberculosis sanatorium was established at the site in 1903, and the complex also cared for the insane, but these functions also were moved out by the mid-'teens. From that period forward, the focus of the facility was on medical care, primarily for the indigent.
The distinction between the early institutions appears to have been that the City Hospital was for those suffering from short-term ailments and injuries, while the Infirmary was intended for people with chronic and long-term health problems. The long distance from the city apparently was thought not to be an inconvenience for such patients, perhaps because they were thought of as permanent residents with little need to leave the facility.
At MetroGeneral Hospital, there has been considerable demolition and re-building at the site, but three major structures — the General Hospital Building, the Psychopathic Building (both built in 1922), and the Nurses' Residence (1926) -- survive with a high level of integrity as excellent representatives of Cleveland's early public health institutions.
All of the historic structures at the Cooley Farms site will soon be gone as redevelopment goes forward. This will leave MetroGeneral Hospital's historic buildings as the only ones remaining with a connection to city and county efforts to create large-scale public health facilities. For this reason, National Register nomination of Metro General's surviving historic structures should be a high priority.[1]

Ohio,Edwin Shaw Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Edwin_Shaw_Hospital,1908,1910,1915,Closed,Rambling Plan,,Springfield Lake Sanitarium,"Construction began on the Springfield Lake Sanitarium in 1910 following the passing of a 1908 Ohio law that forbid tuberculosis patients from being treated in the same facilities as general medical cases and required counties to provide for their treatment.  The Springfield facility was originally constructed on a one hundred acre parcel acquired by Summit, Stark, Portage, Columbiana, and Mahoning County commissioners.  In 1915 the facility opened it's doors to seventy-two patients, a capacity later enlarged to 200.
In 1919 Summit County bought out the shares of the other four counties.  Service further expanded in 1922 when Sunshine Cottage was opened to serve pediatric tuberculosis cases; the program continued to operate until 1947.  In 1934 the facility was renamed in honor of philanthropist Edwin Shaw, a name that would stick with the institution to this day.  In 1959 a law was passed allowing tuberculosis hospitals in Ohio to admit general medical cases and by 1960 most patients were of that nature.  At this point Edwin Shaw gradually began the transition to rehabilitative services, eventually becoming Edwin Shaw Rehabilitative Institute after the hospital relocated to Cuyahoga Falls in 2009.  Today, the original hospital complex still stands abandoned in the outskirts of Akron.[1]","Sanitarium, 1960; Hospital, 2010","Akron, Ohio",,,1915,,200,,,0

So many people were affected with tuberculosis that many patients ended up dying on these grounds. In 1927 it was renamed Hamilton County Tuberculosis Sanatorium. Dr. Henry was one of the main and very important doctors at this facility from 1909 through to 1940. In 1945, the hospital was renamed to Dunham Hospital for him. The facility on the west side had a theater and a laundry facility which were the only ones to survive the area after it turned into a park in 1973.
The Theater Building is still used as a performing arts center while the laundry area has been turned into a garage to maintenance vehicles. The main building was in the center of the park with two different wings around the center. When the main building was destroyed the parking was all that remained. Two more buildings were on the east side.

Ohio,Molly Stark Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Molly_Stark_Sanitarium,,,1929,Closed,Single Building,Albert Thayer,,"The need for the health facility had been felt ever since Stark County had sold its interest in the Springfield Lake tuberculosis hospital to Summit County. But, it took years after the withdraw from the Springfield Lake facility to make Molly Stark a reality. During that time, Stark County’s patients were scattered in other sanitariums throughout the state. An architect was hired. The original plans for a smaller facility grew to a hospital with 150 beds. Financing was obtained through a $750,000 bond issue that Stark County voters passed by “an overwhelming majority,” the newspaper reported.
When the money was assured, bids were let, and the location of the new facility was selected — “a well-adapted site several miles north of Louisville on the Canton-Alliance Road,” explained The Repository. “Of the entire tract, about 25 acres have been landscaped and planted in grass,” explained the newspaper in its article of introduction to the hospital. “A nursery where shrubbery and trees will be grown for transplanting on the landscaped area as needed, will be established at the rear of the property. Wide concrete walks and drives connect all of the buildings. To add to the beauty of the surroundings, all telephone and electric wires have been placed underground.” Those grounds surrounding the hospital were important because of the medical philosophy of most facilities that were constructed to treat tuberculosis at the time — the air and the light of the outdoors cured. “There are five buildings in the hospital group: the main hospital, children’s hospital, nurses home, superintendent’s residence and power plant,” the newspaper noted. “The Spanish style of architecture has been followed and the various units are so arranged as to give a most pleasing effect as viewed from the highway.”
The building itself was organized with an intention of employing psychology with sunshine in the treatment of the patients’ disease. Patients were to be made to feel as though they, if not earning their good health, were at least achieving it. They were lodged in the hospital according to the stage of their disease — and that lodging “improved” during treatment. “Bedridden cases are sent to the upper floor, and as improvement is noted, they are transferred one floor lower until they reach to first floor, which has been set aside for the ambulant or semi-ambulant cases.” Lowest-floor patients were allowed to roam the grounds surrounding Molly Stark Hospital. They bathed in the sunshine and celebrated their cure in that open space.
In later years with the decline of tuberculosis, the facility was converted for use as a nursing home. By the late 1970s funding from the state was cut-off and the hospital was turned over to Stark County to be used for offices. After the concern about asbestos was brought up, it was decided to leave the building entirely instead of paying the large amount for asbestos removal.",1995,"Louisville, OH",Spanish Revival,,,,150,,,0

A sanatorium, also called a sanitarium, is a resort for treatment of chronic diseases. MVDC started out as the Ohio State Sanatorium in 1925 to treat patients having tuberculosis. Treatment was for patients from the age of 7 on up. The hospital treated over 13,000 patients between 1909 & 1945. The Sanatorium changed it's name to Mount Vernon State Hospital in 1945, at that time it began to admit patients with mental illness & tuberculosis. In 1959 people with mental retardation/developmental disabilities without TB were transferred here. At that time the hospital began to admit and treat only patients without TB. On February 1, 1969 the Center's name changed to Mount Vernon State Institute for the Mentally Retarded, home to 492 individuals. On August 9, 1979 the Center was renamed Mount Vernon Developmental Center.
Today, the campus is over 300 acres, with 15 buildings of various sizes and a large underground utility and fiber optic network. It houses 222 residents ranging in age from 25 to 85.

Ohio,William Roche Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=William_Roche_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,,,1937,Closed,Single Building,,William Roche Memorial Hospital,"Due to the prevalence of tuberculosis in America, a tuberculosis hospital was proposed in Lucas County in 1934. Three years later, the William Roche Tuberculosis Sanatorium was opened adjacent to the Lucas County Hospital (Maumee Valley Hospital). It was a hospital established specifically for the care of TB patients. Because of rising rates of the disease in Toledo in 1949,the hospital actually ran out of room and requested to keep some patients in the old Lucas
County Infirmary building.
In November 1950, two 3 mill levies were passed to expand the hospital. However, over time, treatments improved and occurrences of the disease decreased, leaving the William Roche Memorial Hospital at a loss for funding. In 1967, their physical therapy unit was discontinued, and one year later, the entire hospital was closed. From 1969 to 1975, MCO used the building for educational purposes. Though the disease had decreased dramatically, there were still a few tuberculosis patients in the area. In March, 1974, plans were made for general hospitalization of these patients. The William Roche Memorial Hospital was
not in existence as long as the Maumee Valley Hospital, but it was an important institution that played a significant role in the history of the main hospital.",1968,"Toledo, OH",,,1937,1968,,,,0

Urie and Sylvester Alger,Heartland Home,"In 1850, the first county infirmary was opened at a cost of $4,000. There are no known photographs of the building but it was a two-story brick home. Male residents farmed the land and the women canned fruits and vegetables. There was also a slaughter house and enough pork and beef were stored in the winter and chickens were killed and used as needed. 
A new building was constructed in 1897 to replace the original structure that was deemed unsafe. Vernon Redding, who also designed the recently demolished middle school and several churches and homes in Ashland, was the architect. The woodwork was from the late Victorian period. Theo McNeely completed the carpentry work which also included six ornate, oak mirrored mantle pieces.
By 1974, the building was deemed a “maintenance nightmare” by the Ashland County Commissioners and the state fire marshal dubbed it a fire trap and stated it had to be closed. The third county home building known as the Heartland Home was built at a cost of $1.2 million after a bond issue was passed. It was dedicated on Nov. 9, 1975. Many Ashlanders objected to the “sterile” look of the new building though because it lacked the previous “homey atmosphere.” Due to budget reasons, the facility was permanently closed in 2009 and the building is now used for county offices.",2009,"Ashland, OH",,,1850,2009,,,,0
Ohio,Ashtabula County Poorhouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ashtabula_County_Poorhouse,1845,,1858,Demolished,Single Building,,Ashtabula County Infirmary,"Commissioners spent nine months studying various proposals before they determined that Luce’s Kingsville Township farm best fit their original resolution of March 1840 to build the poor house “in (someplace) convenient and suitable as soon as these can be procured at a fair price.” The task of building the poor house went to E.G. Benjamin and Howard Allen, who had the “lowest proposition,” $1,670. The board accepted their bid Feb. 2, 1841, and nine months later settled up with the contractors on their final bill.
The first patient admitted was a 25-year-old man, Dexter Bromer, from Rome Township. Dexter was admitted Jan. 17 and ran away the next day. He returned May 1, 1843, and died on March 19, 1845.
Residents in the infirmary’s early years ranged in age from infants to 84. Most of the residents were children and young adults. Unable to care or provide for themselves for whatever reason, they came from every corner of the county and from every tragic circumstance. Some stayed long enough to get their affairs in order and return to supporting themselves in society. Others were taken in by family and discharged. Some died of smallpox, tuberculosis or old age. One was found dead in the swamp.
The infirmary was funded by property taxes. In 1845, commissioners set the tax rate for the poor house at 1.5 mills per dollar of property value. Another mill was levied for the expenses of operating the poor house and one-half mill for debts related to the infirmary.
The total of 3 mills for the poor house was a big chunk of property taxes. Residents paid only one-half mills for bridges and 5 mills for overall county operations. The infirmary provided housing for 65 residents, and judging from an artist’s rendering done in the 1850s, it was a fine frame building surrounded by pastures and wood fences. It was a working farm, to which more acreage was added in 1851, and inmates capable of physical labor were expected to contribute to their upkeep.
A foreman (later director) and matron oversaw the day-to-day operations under the direction of a three-member board.
By its very nature, the poorhouse was an ever-expanding library filled with volumes of human misery and woe. But on Feb. 2, 1858, the infirmary itself became a tragic story. Late in the afternoon of that day, a Mrs. Huldah Morrison, an inmate, asked a small boy to hand her a lighted stick with which to light her pipe. For whatever reason, Huldah instead thrust the glowing stick into the straw tick of her mattress and opened the door to her room to ensure a draft. The fire spread quickly through the frame building. By the time it was discovered, around 5 p.m., the blaze was well on its way to consuming the home and its occupants. The poorhouse became an inferno in which six inmates were cremated. The victims were Thomas Neno, Joseph Brunson, Eliza Percival, Anna Ellison and a Mr. Minor and Mrs. Bennett.
About 60 of the residents escaped into the winter night. Residents of Kingsville opened their homes to the residents, some of whom had to be sent to other county infirmaries for care. Mrs. Morrison was charged with the crime and sentenced to jail after a jury found her guilty of setting the fire that brought about the deaths of the inmates. Meanwhile, county commissioners tackled the task of rebuilding the infirmary.
In 1858 commissioners set the property tax rates for the infirmary at 0.65 mills for operation and 1 mill for reconstruction. On April 22, 1858, the board accepted a proposal of G.W.  Cummings, Ziba Fox and Josiah Hicks to rebuild the home. For some unrecorded reason, however, it was Charles Hall and E.P. Smith of Conneaut who built the second infirmary at a cost of $9,771. Commissioners settled with the builders on March 7, 1860. The infirmary was expanded in 1902, with D.B. and G.A. Slaybaugh performing the work. A women’s wing and men’s annex were added to the imposing structure in 1907. In March 1913, the infirmary’s population was 31 residents aged 16 to 60, and 71 over 60. As to the causes of their “pauperism,” old age was responsible in 30 of the cases, sickness in 45, loss of members in three, deformity in eight and blindness in three. Seventy-two of the inmates were from Ohio; 31 were foreign-born.
The minutes of the infirmary board’s meetings are filled with tragic stories of people whose last stop on life’s journey was the poorhouse. These samples are from 1910-15: A “colored” woman of age 84, who was sick and destitute, was visiting friends in Geneva when she became ill. She stayed with them six weeks until becoming a burden upon the family. Her personal effects, valued at around $50, were liquidated to the benefit of the county, and she was placed in the care of the infirmary. A 55-year-old transient, very sick with fever and having no means with which to pay for his care, was admitted to the infirmary;
n Edward, a 42-year-old man from Ashtabula, had been in and out of the infirmary. He was admitted once again in 1912, “sick, drunk and destitute.”
Over the course of the 20th century, the infirmary lost its “poor house” stigma and, eventually, the concept of having to labor for one’s keep on the farm was abolished.  Nevertheless, the records of the infirmary board indicate that when an aged resident entered the infirmary, all their possessions and their pension checks were turned over to the county in exchange for the security of a place to sleep, three meals a day and medical care.
For many years, Dr. C.L. Fox of Kingsville served as the infirmary’s physician, earning, in the early 1900s, an annual fee of $300, plus $45 for most all of the medications used at the infirmary. Residents were housed in wards with up to 22 beds in one large room. Fire was a constant fear, with most wards served only by a single staircase and outside metal fire escape. Bedridden patients were housed on the first floor, but there were usually more nonambulatory residents than first-floor beds.
The county added the 55-bed Longview Hospital to the infirmary in the early 1930s to provide care for the chronically ill.
The inadequacy of the infirmary building and its manner of operation came into focus in 1960, when the Ohio Department of Public Welfare pointed out numerous deficiencies. In July 1966, the Department of Industrial Relations found 11 building code violations. Voters eventually passed a $1.68 million bond issue that allowed the county to construct and equip a new county home on the south side of Route 84. The new home opened in November 1971. The infirmary was demolished in December 1973, and the new hospital closed five years later.",1978,"Kingsville, OH",,,1841,1973,55,,102,0
Ohio,Athens County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Athens_County_Infirmary,,1904,1905,Preserved,Single Building,M. Beers,Athens County Farm,"In the first quarter of the nineteenth century, when the general public believed that the insane and paupers could be rehabilitated into productive citizens, the Ohio Legislature gave authorization to county commissioners to establish county ""poor houses."" The Athens County Home, formerly known as the Athens County Infirmary, opened on this site in 1857 to provide care for indigent citizens of Athens County. When fire destroyed the original building in 1903, a new building was constructed from 1904-1905, designed with the capacity to house up to one hundred people. When it was built, it was considered to be one of the finest and most modern charitable institutions of its time.
When the Athens County Infirmary opened in 1906, its design and operation incorporated the principles of scientific charity. This social theory moved away from indiscriminate giving, and instead focused on understanding the causes of poverty and what outcomes might be obtained by charitable acts. Children and mentally ill patients, who had resided in the infirmary before 1906, were sent to other locations. The remaining adult population was divided by sex into separate wings of the building. This included separate dining areas and porches to maintain complete separation of the sexes. Able-bodied residents aided with the farm chores, helping support the operation of the infirmary and the farm on which it resided. Complete with its own livestock, barns, farm equipment, surgical room, and even its own power plant, the facility was nearly self-sufficient. The facility continued to provide housing for indigent and elderly residents until 1997 when the County Commissioners closed the home and it became a primary location for the delivery of social services in Athens County.",1997,"Millfield, OH",Colonial,,1857,1997,100,,,0

This was nine years after the organization of Auglaize County and four years before the start of the Civil War. The County Commissioners purchased 200 acres in Duchouquet Township for $3,800 from William Ross and John Fisher.
There was a two-story log house on the property. Superintendent, William Smith, lived in half of the house and the residents occupied the other half. In 1858, at a cost of $600, a five-room frame building was built for the superintendent to live in.
In 1861, it was decided to erect a large brick building, but because of the high cost of building materials during the Civil War, all bids were rejected. The bids were again received 1867, and a new building was built. In 1891, living quarters were again crowded and a new wing was put on the East side of the building.
On Wednesday, September 25, 1905 at 3:30 A.M., a fire of unknown origin completely destroyed the building and many of its nearby sheds and out-buildings. There were 38 residents at that time. They were moved to infirmaries in adjoining counties, until a new building could be constructed.
There was much discussion in the county about rebuilding west of Wapakoneta along the Wapak-St. Marys Road and the Western Ohio Traction Line. Finally the location was decided by a county wide election held on November 30, 1908. The outcome of the vote was in favor of the old and present location.
The new building built in 1909, at a cost of $68,000, is still in use today and is known as the East Building. In 1976, the County Commissioners decided to construct a 78-bed addition. Residents were moved from the old part of the building to the new and the old part was extensively remodeled. Auglaize Acres was now complete as a Medicaid certified facility with 142 Intermediate care beds.
Auglaize Acres is proud of the fact that it has spanned two centuries and is “Stepping Into The Millennium” with 150 years of service to the people of Auglaize County.",,"Wapakoneta, OH",,,1857,,142,,38,0

An additional tract was purchased making a total of 365 acres.  Currently, approximately 300 acres are leased.  The tracts were set aside for a county dog pound, cemetery, and garden.  The garden was farmed last by County Home residents and personnel in 1967.  The Carroll County hospital (as it was called) was built in 1937 with county funds and opened for use April 1, 1938.  By the early 50’s, it was difficult to keep the buildings in decent repair.  A bond issues enabled the county to renovate the outmoded facility and add the new building which was completed in 1954.  The County Home was named Carroll Golden Age Retreat in 1988.  It has been operated continuously by the county as a residential facility and today the Home provides custodial care and assisted living for persons not requiring “skilled” nursing care.",,"Carrollton, OH",,,1938,,,,,1

Ohio,Columbiana County Poorhouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Columbiana_County_Poorhouse,,,1829/1879/1964,Demolished,Single Building,,Columbiana County Infirmary | Columbiana County Home,"The original county home, opened in 1829, was roughly one mile south of the present county home near the current day Robert Bycroft school. Over time, as the needs and population of the infirmary grew so did the amount of structures. By September 1880, the infirmary held 176 inmates, decreasing to 125 people by February 1905. A remodeling project to the circa 1873 building, costing nearly $5,000, were completed in late-1908. A small hospital with three wards and 30 beds was added in 1936 by the Public Works Administration. Prior to the completion of the hospital, patients were sent to the City Hospital in Salem. In the 1930's the needs of the institution was such that a small brick hospital was built on the property to care for the people living in the institution.
On December 12, 1960, the state Department of Industrial Relations ordered the county to discontinue occupancy of the county infirmary due to violations found during an inspection in November. The administration building, primary residence, hospital building, and laundry and boiler building were all found to be deficient and the review also noted inadequate sanitary facilities and the severe negligence of maintenance. The order gave the county 120 days to evacuate the residents but two extensions to delay the county home’s closure were granted. In April 1964, the county requested $200,000 in federal Auxiliary Works Program funds for which the county would pay an equal amount of money for a new county nursing facility. It was approved and the ground was broken for a one-story, 40-unit county nursing home on April 17, 1964. Built by Riley Construction of Alliance for $430,000, the new county home opened in mid-January 1965 but it was unable to admit its first 20 residents until August 17 due to a lack of equipment.
The original infirmary complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In 1994, the nursing home was renovated and expanded into a county-wide jail. The poor house was finally closed in 1976. The county abandoned efforts to use federal funds to demolish the infirmary in June 2010 as it would have required a waiver from the state Office of Historic Preservation. The Columbiana County Infirmary complex was demolished in 2016, with components from the building salvaged by the Amish community for reuse.

Ohio,Cooley Farms,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cooley_Farms,1909,,1912,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Warrensville House of Correction | Highland View Hospital | Cuyahoga Chronic Hospital | Cleveland Workhouse | Sunny Acres Sanitarium | Warrensville Sanitarium | Cleveland City Hospital Tuberculosis Sanitarium,"In his ongoing fight against people of privilege and on behalf of the ""common man,"" Tom Johnson found a friend and soulmate in his church pastor, Harris R. Cooley. Three years younger than Johnson, Cooley was born in Royalton, Ohio on October 18, 1857. His father was Lathrop Cooley, a well-known minister in the Disciples of Christ church. He was active in various ministries in the Western Reserve for six decades, and he imparted to his son a sense of duty and obligation to the less fortunate members of society. The elder Cooley preached at the city workhouse, the city jail, and the Aged Women's Home, and he served as superintendent and chaplain of the Cleveland Bethel Union, a seaman's mission involved in work-relief programs.
Cooley's son Harris trained for the ministry at Hiram and Oberlin colleges and served as pastor in several Cleveland and northeast Ohio churches. At Cleveland's Cedar Avenue Christian Church he befriended Tom Johnson, and the two men soon found that they shared strongly held beliefs about social justice and economic and political equality.
One of those shared beliefs concerned the causes of criminal activity. Cooley and Johnson, like most Progressives, believed that the physical setting in which people lived actually influenced whether they would engage in criminal activity. The city itself— especially the run-down industrial districts and the neighborhoods where industrial workers lived -- bred crime like a swamp breeds mosquitoes. A collateral problem was the disease and disability often found in these places. Both Cooley and his friend the mayor believed that humane treatment, both of the ill and of the criminally inclined, was essential to the recovery of both and that removal from the city setting was the appropriate way to achieve this goal. The city's citizens would regain physical and social health by being removed from the city — an anti-urban attitude that shaped much of American social and economic policy during the 20th century.
Immediately upon taking office as mayor, Johnson appointed Cooley as Director of Charities and Corrections for the City of Cleveland. Cooley held this post for ten years, into the administration of Mayor Newton D. Baker. Acting on his theory that the crowding, dirt, noise, and other negative aspects of urban life militated against public health and healthy lifestyles, upon his appointment to his city post Cooley began to develop the idea of a rural campus, ""wholesome surroundings"" in which the city's charges could be cared for without the evils of the city intruding. Mayor Johnson gave Cooley his vigorous support, and acquisition of land began in 1904. The location was in Warrensville Township, some 10 miles southeast of downtown Cleveland, on a high tract of rolling rural land. The city had already begun acquiring land here in 1902 for a cemetery and between 1904 and 1912 acquired some 25 farms at a total cost of $350,000. The complex eventually totaled 2,000 acres, located primarily between Northfield and Richmond roads (which ran north-south) and on either side of Harvard Road (which ran east-west).
Cooley himself expressed the purpose of the new facility in terms which summed up his philosophy and his attitude toward his fellow man -- terms which might be considered softhearted and romantic by some but which went to the core beliefs of this unusual public official. Speaking of the indigent and the delinquent in particular, Cooley said:
“They have made the human voyage. Among the unfortunates are some who have been wasteful, intemperate, and vicious. Some are undeserving, some have done wrong, but these things are true of some of the children of luxury.”
The entire complex became known as Cooley Farms and became widely known for its progressive approach toward the people in its care. Consistent with Cooley's and the mayor's ideas about crime, the complex also included a correctional facility for rehabilitation of lawbreakers. Attitudes of the time held that negative influences of the urban setting contributed to crime and vice and that removal of offenders from that environment was essential to their ""correction."" The Cleveland Workhouse was first established in 1855 on the Scranton Road site near the city's hospital and infirmary. It moved in 1871 to a site on Woodland Avenue at East 79th Street, and in 1912 it became part of Cooley Farms.
There were four components of Cooley Farms, all of which were in place by the period just before World War I. They included Colony Farm, which was the city infirmary/poorhouse, which also included a halfway house and cottages for elderly couples; Highland Park Farm, the city cemetery; Overlook Farm, a tuberculosis sanatorium; and Correction Farm, the city workhouse and house of corrections. The first two were north of Harvard Road, the cemetery in the northwest quadrant and Colony Farm in the northeast quadrant. The other two were south of Harvard, the Correction Farm in the southwest quadrant and Overlook Farm in the southeast. Each of the four occupied about 500 acres.
Adoption of the name ""Farms"" was not just to commemorate the original use of the land. Social philosophy of the time held that productive work was important in rehabilitating people of all kinds, from the aged and ill to the poor and the criminal. Thus the Cooley Farms complex was set up as a working farm, nearly self-sufficient, where everyone was expected to work according his physical and mental ability. Workhouse inmates did the heaviest work, which included operation of a quarry for building stone and cement production. They worked at the facility's dairy, piggery, greenhouse, blacksmith shop, sawmill and cannery. Farm work included vegetable and feed production and an orchard. Workhouse inmates also maintained the grounds of the entire complex and worked on construction of many of the buildings. Able-bodied residents of the other ""farms"" also worked, mainly at lighter tasks. The entire Cooley Farms complex was considered a model for progressive treatment of social ills, the workhouse in particular. Social and economic journals of the day devoted considerable space to studies of the complex, and the Cleveland facility inspired similar efforts in Toledo and in two cases in New York City, the Farm Colony on Staten Island and the 1930s Camp LaGuardia in rural Orange County, intended for derelicts from the Bowery.
The workhouse at Correction Farm, completed in 1912, was also called the Cooley Farms Workhouse and the Cleveland House of Corrections. A women's wing was added in 1913, and a separate boiler house was part of the original construction. The architect was J. Milton Dyer, a major Cleveland architect who had to his credit such important structures as Cleveland City Hall, the Peerless Motor Car Company, and the U.S. Coast Guard Station. The buildings employed a restrained Spanish Colonial Revival style, represented primarily by their red clay tile hip roofs and stuccoed walls. They were replaced by new facilities in the mid-1980s, and no historic structures survive at the site today.
Overlook Farm, the tuberculosis sanatorium, was first located in the Robert J. Walkden house, one of the farmhouses acquired by the city when it was making land purchases for Cooley Farms. Located on the west side of Richmond Readjust north of Harvard Road, the house served from 1906 until completion of the main sanatorium in 1913. The Walkden house was an 1870 Italianate building of brick construction. It had been unused and was in a state of deterioration at the time it was destroyed by fire in 1982.
The 1913 sanatorium was known as both Sunny Acres Sanatorium and Sunny Acres Hospital (exposure to sunlight was at one time thought to help cure tuberculosis). Both the main building and a 1931 addition were designed in a simplified Mission Revival style, which complemented the Spanish Colonial Revival elements of the Cleveland Workhouse and the Colony Farm. The 1913 building was designed by Herman Kregelius, and the 1931 addition was designed by George S. Ryder. The original facility, and its 1931 addition, survived into the late 1970s, when they were demolished for a new facility, which still serves as part of the county's health care system as a long-term skilled nursing facility. No historic structures remain at the Sunny Acres site today.
The principal buildings of the Colony Farm, which was the replacement for the old City Infirmary at the Scranton Road site near downtown, were completed between 1909 and 1912.
Other later structures, discussed below, expanded the complex, and a large new main hospital building was built in the early 1950s after the complex was transferred to Cuyahoga County. It was about this time that the complex became known as Highland View Hospital. The sit was on the north side of Harvard Road west of Richmond Road.
The original complex included eight buildings: the Old Couples' Cottage, the Female Insane Cottage, the North Dormitory, the Administration Building, the Quadrangle, the Power House, the South Dormitory, and the Male Insane Cottage. The design of the complex was the work of J. Milton Dyer, architect of the workhouse. The symmetry of the complex indicated the formality of the Beaux-Arts design Dyer originally proposed, which was abandoned in favor of the modest Spanish Mission-influenced design ultimately built.
The complex at its peak had fifteen separate structures and today consists of nine standing buildings and one set of ruins. Four of the buildings standing on the site were listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 8, 1979, including original Colony Farm buildings known today as Sweeney Hall, Bingham Hall, the Quadrangle Building, and Carter Hall; the nomination was prepared by the Cuyahoga County Archives and was called ""Cooley Farms Group."" The nomination also included the Cleveland House of Corrections, the House of Corrections Boiler House, and the Robert J. Walkden House. As was noted above, all of these buildings have been demolished.
The combined Sanborn maps of 1926-51/1953-61 give a picture of the hospital complex when it had reached its greatest size. From north to south, the principal buildings by the late 1950s included the following:
Other surviving elements of the site include concrete walks, paved drives and parking areas, and portions of former tunnels and covered passageways that provided all-weather access between some buildings. There are numerous trees and shrubs, many of which obviously were part of the site's landscaping; others have grown up since the property was abandoned in the early 1980s.
Under the county's administration, Highland View Hospital became well known for its care of chronically ill patients, specializing in treating the chronically disabled, stroke victims, and patients with neuro-muscular diseases. In 1957-58 the Cuyahoga County Hospital system was established and was credited with being the nation's first county-run public hospital system. Highland View and City Hospital (now MetroHealth Medical Center, at the original Scranton Road location) were the system's two principal units.
Between 1969 and 1973, the county began a move to phase out Highland View in favor of MetroGeneral Hospital at the location near downtown Cleveland. This decision apparently was made for financial reasons, to cut the cost necessary to run two large hospital complexes. By 1978 the last of Highland View's patients was transferred to MetroGeneral. Other than use of two wings of the Main Building in the early 1980s as an alcoholism treatment center, the buildings at Highland View were never used again. The site was proposed for redevelopment during the 1980s by a local industrialist, but these plans never materialized. More recently, the property has been transferred to a Cleveland developer and is proposed for long-term commercial development.
Back near downtown Cleveland, after removal of the non-medical functions to Cooley Farms by the period just before World War I, City Hospital continued to operate in both the 1889 structure and in the former infirmary building. A tuberculosis sanatorium was established at the site in 1903, and the complex also cared for the insane, but these functions also were moved out by the mid-'teens. From that period forward, the focus of the facility was on medical care, primarily for the indigent.
The distinction between the early institutions appears to have been that the City Hospital was for those suffering from short-term ailments and injuries, while the Infirmary was intended for people with chronic and long-term health problems. The long distance from the city apparently was thought not to be an inconvenience for such patients, perhaps because they were thought of as permanent residents with little need to leave the facility.
At MetroGeneral Hospital, there has been considerable demolition and re-building at the site, but three major structures — the General Hospital Building, the Psychopathic Building (both built in 1922), and the Nurses' Residence (1926) -- survive with a high level of integrity as excellent representatives of Cleveland's early public health institutions.
All of the historic structures at the Cooley Farms site will soon be gone as redevelopment goes forward. This will leave MetroGeneral Hospital's historic buildings as the only ones remaining with a connection to city and county efforts to create large-scale public health facilities. For this reason, National Register nomination of Metro General's surviving historic structures should be a high priority.[1]

Highland View and City Hospital (now MetroHealth Medical Center, at the original Scranton Road location) were the system's two principal units.
Between 1969 and 1973, the county began a move to phase out Highland View in favor of MetroGeneral Hospital at the location near downtown Cleveland. This decision apparently was made for financial reasons, to cut the cost necessary to run two large hospital complexes. By 1978 the last of Highland View's patients was transferred to MetroGeneral. Other than use of two wings of the Main Building in the early 1980s as an alcoholism treatment center, the buildings at Highland View were never used again. The site was proposed for redevelopment during the 1980s by a local industrialist, but these plans never materialized. More recently, the property has been transferred to a Cleveland developer and is proposed for long-term commercial development.
Back near downtown Cleveland, after removal of the non-medical functions to Cooley Farms by the period just before World War I, City Hospital continued to operate in both the 1889 structure and in the former infirmary building. A tuberculosis sanatorium was established at the site in 1903, and the complex also cared for the insane, but these functions also were moved out by the mid-'teens. From that period forward, the focus of the facility was on medical care, primarily for the indigent.
The distinction between the early institutions appears to have been that the City Hospital was for those suffering from short-term ailments and injuries, while the Infirmary was intended for people with chronic and long-term health problems. The long distance from the city apparently was thought not to be an inconvenience for such patients, perhaps because they were thought of as permanent residents with little need to leave the facility.
At MetroGeneral Hospital, there has been considerable demolition and re-building at the site, but three major structures — the General Hospital Building, the Psychopathic Building (both built in 1922), and the Nurses' Residence (1926) -- survive with a high level of integrity as excellent representatives of Cleveland's early public health institutions.
All of the historic structures at the Cooley Farms site will soon be gone as redevelopment goes forward. This will leave MetroGeneral Hospital's historic buildings as the only ones remaining with a connection to city and county efforts to create large-scale public health facilities. For this reason, National Register nomination of Metro General's surviving historic structures should be a high priority.[1]

The three story brick structure was completed for a cost of $8,500.00. Struck by lightning on the morning of June 2, 1897, it burned to the ground. Seventy five residents were housed at the fairgrounds until a hastily built temporary structure was erected. A permanent building was completed in 1898. It was one of the many 19th century Ohio poorhouses that took care of the destitute (or just their children), mentally ill, and elderly. Residents were referred to as ""paupers"" in the register. Sometimes parents under financial burdens would send their children to places like this. Eight-year-old Ohioan Annie Oakley was sent to this infirmary by her widowed Mother and lived there for 2 years in the 1860's until she was hired out by a family to do chores.

Ohio,Erie County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Erie_County_Infirmary,,1885,1886,Preserved,Single Building,George Phillip Feick,Erie County Poor House | Erie County Home,"In 1816 the Ohio General Assembly authorized boards of county commissioners to construct county poor houses to care for paupers. From 1838, when the State Legislature, established Erie County, until around 1850, indigent citizens were cared for in individual homes with the respective township funding their care. However, Portland Township did have a poor house, a residence where a number of citizens lived in one household. In March 1850, the Erie County Poor House farm consisted of about 63 acres of land with Milan Road on the east and Bloomingville Road (later renamed South Columbus Avenue) on the west.
In 1850 the legislature voted to change the name from Poor House to the County Infirmary. An Erie County Infirmary was established in Erie County in 1855 to serve as a home for the aged and indigent. The original building was destroyed by fire in 1885 and the current structure, the historic limestone building at 2900 Columbus Avenue, (the Erie County Services Center), was built in 1886. In 1919 the name changed from the Erie County Infirmary to the Erie County Home.
In 1976 the Erie County Home residents were transferred to the new facility at 3916 East Perkins Avenue, Huron, Ohio, which was dedicated on July 4, 1976, and renamed the Erie County Care Facility. Our facility is proud to have provided health care services to the residents of Erie County for more than 145 years.",1976,"Sandusky, OH",Second Empire,,1855,,,,,0
Ohio,Fairfield County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fairfield_County_Infirmary,,,1828,Preserved,Single Building,,Fairfield County Infirmary,"The Fairfield County Home was opened in 1828 as a frame structure, said Dave Fey, director of the Fairfield County Historical Parks District. The brick building that stands today was built in 1840 and expanded in 1865. This building soon filled to capacity and a large brick building replaced it in 1840. The building was expanded on again in 1865 and numerous outbuildings were constructed to serve various purposes, including a laundry, tenant house, storage, and farming facilities. A farm was established across the road from the infirmary to help sustain those living there. In 1917, the infirmary farm brought in a total of $4,300 from the sale of crops and livestock. Natural gas lines were run to the infirmary in 1917 to provide lighting and heat. In 1926, 3,857 feet of pipe was laid to provide water to the infirmary, which previously relied on a natural spring and groundwater. The infirmary didn’t see electricity until 1958.
The home’s last residents (called inmates in the 19th century) left in 1985, sent to nursing homes or other care. County officials remodeled the building for government offices in 1986 and named the building for Clarence E. Miller, the late former congressman. The farmland across from the infirmary was sold to Ohio University in the mid-1960s to establish a remote campus there. The infirmary’s population continued to dwindle until just sixteen residents remained when the facility closed for good in May 1985. Those remaining residents were sent to nursing or foster homes. The old infirmary was remodeled in 1986, adding a sprinkler system, enclosed stairwells, emergency lighting and a fire alarm, to accommodate county offices. The building was rechristened the Clarence E. Miller Building, named for the late former congressman, and served as the county’s health department for the next 27 years.
By 2011, the building was literally falling apart. Mold, crumbling walls, loose bricks and other concerns were commonplace. A study showed the facility would require over $4 million in renovations to resurrect the building. The health department decided to move to a leased modern office building in Lancaster in 2013. February 2020 the building was purchased by Adam Kimmell.",1985,"Lancaster, OH",,,1828,1985,,,16,0

The first County Infirmary, initially known as the poor house, was built in 1833 at the fork of the Scioto and Olentangy Rivers and housed nine residents. In 1869 land was purchased to build a larger and more accessible facility at the west end of King Avenue. Plans were drawn up by the architect N. B. Kelly but the County Commissioners decided the project too expensive and the land was sold. By 1876 ninety eight acres of land were purchased on Eberle Road (now Alum Creek Drive).  On November 1, 1883 residents moved into the new infirmary, built to accommodate 350 residents.  The plans were similar to those originally created for the property on King Avenue.  The infirmary continued to be used for 85 years until new buildings were erected in 1968.

In the new building, the number of inmates continued to increase. In June of 1858, there was only one person admitted. By the following June, the admissions had increased to about 5 or 6 people a month. A third building was constructed in 1869, and a children's home was added in 1880. Future space concerns were solved by building additional wings to the building, rather than constructing an entirely new one.
Initially called the ""Poor House,"" the original intention of the institution was to provide destitute Greene County residents with a place to live, and potentially a way to find work. This mission later expanded and they took in anyone who could not support themselves, be it caused by disability, sickness, or insanity. The name of the institution changed to reflect that, being called the ""Greene County Home"" and eventually the ""Greene County Infirmary.""
Those that stayed at the infirmary had to abide by a strict set of rules. Any violation of these rules resulted in their discharge from the institution. These rules included the fact that every patient had to do their daily chores. They weren’t allowed to swear, or to spit tobacco in the bedrooms. Visiting hours were open, but prohibited on the Sabbath. There was no smoking or drinking allowed. They also had to wash up before every meal. These are not unreasonable rules, especially for the time, and yet people were dismissed from the Infirmary for breaking them quite often. Individuals  who were deemed ""insane"" or ""idiotic"" resided in a separate building on the infirmary's campus. The recovery process for some very ill inmates required extended stays.
The grand three-story infirmary building stood for 108 years in Xenia (1869-1977). Several different records were found before the building was torn down. They were given to Greenewood Manor. The Greene County Archives have some of these whimsical records.",,"Xenia, OH",,,1829,1977,,,,0

The proposition was defeated by a large majority.  However a few years later, the county commissioners took steps toward purchasing a convenient location for a so-called ""Poor Farm"".  The first site selected was 160 acres of land about 2 1/2 miles northeast of Kenton, owned by John Parkinson.  The farm was purchased, but nothing was done toward improving it, nor was it ever occupied for the purpose intended.  In the fall of 1868, B.R. Brunson and David Snodgrass, two of the county commissioners, concluded that the Parkinson Farm was not a suitable place for an infirmary,  and against the protest of Samuel Wood, the other member of the Board, voted to change the location.  They selected a site west of Kenton on the Lima Road.  The present county home farm was purchased for $5,000.00 An infirmary was erected on this site and was opened for inmates on January 5, 1871.  The auditor's report for the year of 1869 stated that the farm and buildings cost $46,000.00.
The present county home was voted on by the voters at the November 1953 general election for a bond issue of $600,000.00 to run for 20 years.  The bond issue passed by a vote of 5,112 to 3,461.  The present county home was ready for occupancy in 1957. Hardin County Home was built in 1955, with quite a bit of remodeling done between 1976-1977.  More remodeling was done in 2000.  The Board of Education moved into the lower level and all residents were moved to the upper level.  Then in 2002 the chapel was transformed into 2 new suites with restrooms and the front entrance received a face lift.  The Home must operate according to ODH rules, regulations and nursing home laws.  It is subject to an annual state survey.  Nursing Assistants employed must be state-approved with the Ohio Department of Health Long Term Care Nurseaide program.  Hardin County Home is independent of the County General Fund.  We are self-supporting through medicaid, medicare and private pay residents.

The matter was submitted to the voters of the County at the election in 1859. The County Commissioners purchased the Adams farm, containing 320 acres, at $65.00 per acre. Building the Infirmary proceeded slowly due to the Civil War and the lack of funds. The building was finally completed in 1867 at the cost of $24,000.

Ohio,Jackson County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jackson_County_Poor_Farm,,,1839/1887,Demolished,Single Building,,Jackson County Infirmary,"Jackson County’s poor house/farm became one of the first created in the earliest days of Michigan statehood. Generation after generation of poor souls lived there. Some were blind, deaf or insane, and others just homeless for a variety of reasons. The 1881 “History of Jackson County” documented that 33 people — equal numbers of men and women — lived there then. The men worked about the farm and in the garden, barn and wood pile. The women performed household duties. Fire destroyed the original poor house about 1886 and a new wooden frame building with a brick exterior was built a year later.
After World War II, federal and state governments issued more mandates, and poor houses and farms began to vanish from the social landscape. Counties could no longer warehouse people, but they were expected to provide medical care. By 1950, Jackson County’s poor-home residents were so aged and infirm they were no longer capable of field work. The Social Services Board put the farm up for sale, and on Aug. 15, 1951, the Citizen Patriot reported the sale of 183 acres, for $18,350, to John Jenkins. By about 1960, the grand old poor home was in serious decline. The county put to voters a $1.7 million bond issue to build a new Jackson County Medical Care Facility on Lansing Avenue.
In February of 1963 nearly 90 residents were moved from the old poor home to the new building. And the old building sat empty — except for May 1963, when it briefly served as a hideaway for four escaped Southern Michigan Prison convicts. In the summer of 1964, the poor home was sold to local Seventh-day Adventists for $12,000. They built a school on the property, a short distance from the old home. On April 23, 1967, a father and two sons who had a contract to demolish the old home inadvertently started a fire. They were burning rubbish in an open area when sparks apparently settled in the home’s eaves. Within moments, the top of the building went up in flames.",1963,"Jackson, MI",,,,1963,,,90,0

Ohio,Lake County Poorhouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lake_County_Poorhouse,1852,,1876,Preserved,Single Building,Benjamin Morse,Lake County Infirmary | Lake County Home,"The new Lake County History Center occupies a building constructed in 1876 by the Lake County Commissioners. The building replaced the former “Lake County Infirmary,” earlier known as the County Poor House, that had occupied the property since 1852 when the County bought a farm house and 110 acres from the Pettingel family. Benjamin F. Morse was hired to design the new structure and Col. Arthur McAllister of Cleveland was named as builder. McAllister had built a reputation through construction of homes on Millionaires Row and the Soldiers and Sailors monument on Public Square in Cleveland.
The two-story T-shaped Italian ate structure remains an excellent example of an 1800’s institutional building retaining its architectural integrity and historic significance. The building was designed with four rooms at the front of the building designated as superintendent’s quarters on the first and second floor, followed by two wings extending from each side of the center to house residents, men and women in separate wings. The rear extension held the kitchen, dining hall and laundry area. The basement level was used for storage and workshop areas as well as a number of cells for housing the mentally ill. In 1897, a cottage hospital was added that served the entire county until a modern hospital was built in Painesville in 1924. Residents were supported by county tax dollars, individual donations and a large working farm on the grounds.
In 1900, the very first medical facility in Lake County opened up at the Poor House. It was built just off of the main house in a detached building to stop the spread of disease. It was considered modern at the time and operated until the 1930s. The facility was referred to as an infirmary and the patients were actually called inmates.
The Lake County Home remained one of the few operating facilities in the state until 2004. With only 9 residents remaining, a task force determined the facility needed to be closed. Residents were transferred to other facilities and the home sold to the adjoining school district, Riverside Local. Visitors today will still be able to see much of the original home, cells, cottage hospital and outbuildings as the Society continues to refurbish the building as the Lake County History Center. The records of the County Home residents and business affairs have been recorded since 1852 and are kept in the Lake County Administration Building in Painesville. The home was sold to Painesville Township who then negotiated a purchase to the local school district, Riverside Local.
The Lake County Infirmary Cemetery was located on Riverside Drive just north of the Infirmary, now called the County Home. The home was opened in 1852 on the former William Pettingell farm. From the Record of Paupers in Lake County Infirmary Commencing July 22, 1852, the first burial was that of Robert Gordon, aged 64 years, who died August 14th, 1852, “of Dystentary and Buried in the Infirmary Burying Ground.” The Record contains numerous entries for burials over the years.
In March, 1877, the bodies interred in the county infirmary ground were removed to Evergreen Cemetery, where a lot had been purchased for the County. The Painesville Telegraph reported that the old ground, near the infirmary building, “had been used for burial purposes for seven years.”",2004,"Painesville, OH",,,1852,2004,,,,0

Simon Parker was the superintendent and Elias Nigh, clerk.  The farm, in which corn and oats were raised, comprised twenty-six acres.  The infirmary proper was a one-story brick building, 130 feet by 38 feet, and contained twenty-four rooms, which were never vacant.  Superintendent Parker's residence was a two story house, with an L, about a quarter of the size of the main building. In 1918 or 1919, a small  building was added to the property. In 1949, the infirmary was remodeled. The building had a total of fifty-five rooms. The third floor housed the twenty-two patients. Sixteen women and six men called the infirmary home in 1949. Many of the residents were “old-aged pensioners,” who could not afford to live elsewhere. Mr. and Mrs. Albert Hanshaw were superintendents in 1949. The couple made their home on the second floor of the building. The first floor included twelve rooms. The building’s new ten bed, hospital ward was located on this floor. The floor also housed the laundry room, heating plant and storage. People was not the only residents on the property. The infirmary boasted 230 chickens, bee hives and several hogs. A Shepherd named King had called the infirmary home for fifteen years before the construction in 1949.",,"Coal Grove, OH",,,1857,,10,22,,0
Ohio,Licking County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Licking_County_Infirmary,,,1850,Demolished,Single Building,,Licking County Poorhouse | Licking County Home,"The Infirmary housed persons who were impoverished, homeless or otherwise in great need. It was established under the authority of the County Commissioners in 1838. Until 1850 it was officially called the Poor House, and from 1919 onwards it was called the County Home. The original institution was located near the present-day community of Union Station.
The population of the home usually stayed around 100, with people of a large range of ages coming and going. Babies were born there, some children were moved to orphanages or sent out for farm work, and adults might spend most of their adult lives there, helping with maintaining the grounds and operation of the home. Several people ran away only to return later, others were discharged back to their families, and some even died at the home. Families sometimes moved the dead to private cemeteries, but about 260 people were buried in the infirmary cemetery.
James Lucus and his wife were superintendent and matron from April 1914 until February 1939, when Edgar Burrell and his wife were appointed. My late wife, Mary Lou, was a friend of Burrell’s daughter, Burdell, and she spent several nights there. They, of course, had to be kept separate from the residents. The Burrells lasted until July 1960, when Homer Comisford and his wife took over. The home was moved to the old Tuberculosis Sanitarium on Price Road, where Mrs. Comisford was the last superintendent.
The Infirmary Cemetery has been known by many names including ""farm plot burials,"" ""County Home Cemetery"" and ""Infirmary burial ground."" Most of its known graves from ca. 1904 to 1955 were marked with stones that only showed identification numbers. There do not seem to be headstones remaining for inmate burials before 1904. Most of the bodies of inmates who died before 1904 might have been taken to private cemeteries or another ""potters field."" The last known burial in the Infirmary Cemetery was in 1955.",1969,"Newark, OH",,,1838,,,,100,0

It was built in 1868 on land the county commissioners purchased because it was central to the county and close to the county seat in Elyria, said Smith. It became a very large complex, a working farm, on more than 200 acres. A poorhouse was a place that provided people a place to go if they could no longer support themselves. Communities thought they were doing a good thing because it often cost less to have a facility for people than to try to support them in their own homes. In the 1900s the poorhouses gradually began to be known as the county home, a term used well past the middle of the twentieth century. Residents were transferred to an Amherst facility when the infirmary closed in 1967. It used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. It is now a nursing home.",1967,"Elyria, OH",,,1868,1967,,,,0

The Lucas County Poor Farm was established in 1838 and located at the southeast corner of Detroit and Arlington Ave. The farm sustained many of society’s outcasts, including the mentally ill, the infirm, the disabled, elderly, epileptics, and others that were unable to support themselves. In 1861 the Lucas County Commissioners voted to construct
an asylum on the poor farm to handle the mentally ill that were being housed in jails. It was also at this time that the name of the institution was changed from the “Poor Farm” to the “County Infirmary.”
In 1869 the Ohio Board of State Charities (OBSC) deemed the county infirmary to be inadequate and need of improvement. Along with improvements to existing structures being made, a new building to replace the previous asylum and house the growing numbers of mentally ill was constructed and completed in 1871. This building was named the Northwestern Hospital for the Insane. This three-story structure accommodated up to 100 patients and was in operation until
1888 when many of the patients were transferred to the newly constructed Toledo Asylum for the Insane located on the southwest corner of Detroit and Arlington. The Toledo Asylum for the Insane was initially capable of accommodating the growing number of mentally ill that were otherwise being placed in jails.",,"Toledo, OH",,,1838,1888,100,,,0

The land is located on state Route 42 towards South Charleston, across the road from where Cordle’s Motel is now located. The county didn’t actually purchased the land until June 1866. The house that was standing on the property was the first infirmary. The new structure became operational in January 1872. The building was brick with a stone foundation and stood four stories high. The basement or first story contained 19 rooms. Each of the other stories contained 20 rooms.

It was known by various names; the County Home, the Poor House and locally as the old “Pogey.” The homeless, handicapped, elderly and poor were housed there.  Some stayed only a short time and some stayed until their death. There are records of women who gave birth there and it is also recorded that at times children lived in the home. Prior to Mahoning County’s creation of the Infirmary (Poor House) needy and challenged individuals were cared for by the township where they resided. In some cases reports state that people were run out of town before they had a chance to become a public charge. Also at times the county may have taken a role in the care of these unfortunates. There was a home established in Trumbull County in 1835 and prior to 1846 when Mahoning County was formed, some public charges may have been sent there.
A search was initiated in deed records to establish when the Infirmary was established.  Through these records it was discovered that the county home opened in November of 1855. The original proprietors of the land where the Infirmary was located were stockholders in the Connecticut Land Company. They acquired ownership in 1798. Judson Canfield sold this particular lot (lot 1, 4th division) to Otis Guild with a deed dated January 4, 1800. The subject of establishing the Infirmary appears in the Mahoning County Commissioner’s minutes of March 1854; however no action was taken. On April 12, 1854, the selection process of finding a suitable farm for the poor house was begun by viewing several farms in the county. At an adjourned meeting the next day, the choice was announced. Three Infirmary Directors were elected at the Mahoning County general election on October 9, 1955. For three year staggered terms, James Brown, James Jones and Manuel Hamilton were chosen.
The Mahoning County Infirmary was completed in 1898, replacing the original building destroyed by fire in February 1897. Of the 240 inmates, only one died in that fire. In January 1909, the men’s wing of the building was gutted by fire, which started on the third floor. At that time, thirteen men of the total population of 225 in the institution suffered burns; four died.

A fire destroyed the original building, and it was rebuilt in 1861.  This main building is still in use today, and several additions have been constructed.
For many years, the County Home was a working farm.  Proceeds from farming operations helped offset the cost of running the facility.  Hogs, sheep, and chickens were kept at the County Home and a dairy was operated.  In 1961 the dairy was replaced with a herd of beef cattle. In 1970, the Medina County Board of Commissioners decided to discontinue farming and raising of livestock.  The remaining acreage is currently being leased for farming.

On October 24, 1877, the farm was increased in size by the purchase of a 160-acre tract, adjoining the first mentioned tract on the south, being described as follows: East half of the southeast quarter, the northwest quarter of the southeast quarter and the northeast quarter of the southwest quarter of section 3, township 6 south, range 2 east. The property was bought of David E. Gray for $1,000. The Infirmary farm is located about two miles west of Celina, in Jefferson township. The buildings and grounds are well cared for and present a very pleasing appearance. The farm is almost entirely self-supporting, the only support derived from the county being through the liquor tax. The institution has about 50 inmates yearly. The present superintendent, Sylvester H. Weaver, succeeded Michael Reusch in 1903; the latter was in charge for 15 years, succeeding Alexander Partner.
On September 11, 1863, B. F. Suwalde, George W. Mosier and Thomas Upton were appointed directors of the County Infirmary to take charge of the property until their successors were duly elected. The original house on the Hale property was used until 1868, when an additional house was built at a cost of $1,550, the work being finished by Fred. Beckman. The building was a frame structure, 32 by 42 feet in dimensions, attached to the main building with a hall through the center 12 feet wide and with four sleeping rooms. On July 22, 1871, a brick building was contracted for to cost $8,278, which was completed in 1873. In the latter year a barn, 46 by 72 feet in dimensions, was erected by William Long at a cost of $1,000. The wants and comforts of the inmates requiring new and more convenient rooms, the contract for another building was awarded on March 30, 1876, to J. S. Smith, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, for $7,270, which was finished and completed to the satisfaction of the directors October 13, 1876.

The number of occupants reported for the first year was nineteen.  Since the first building was poorly constructed and inadequate as to accommodations, a new building was authorized in 1852 and occupied in 1854.  This building was 116 feet long and 46 feet wide with a hall extending the length through the center of each floor.  It consisted of an elevated basement, two principal stories, and an attic eight feet in height which gave the appearance of a four-story building.  Before the new building was completed, a violent storm tumbled the old building down on the heads of the inmates, injuring many.
By 1879 the number of inmates had increased to 116. This number included boys and girls who were soon to be transferred to the new Children’s Home. On May 20, 1886, a contract was let to T. R. Townsend for building an additional building for the Miami County Infirmary to accommodate the permanently insane.  This is today at the rear of the south end of the main building.

McGrath,Morgan County Infirmary | Morgan County Home for the Insane,"In 1849 the county commissioners purchased a county farm, or poor farm, as it was then styled. The tract contains 314 acres, and is situated upon the river two and a half miles below McConnelsville. The price paid for it was $6,600. Work was at once begun, new buildings erected and old ones repaired, and the paupers removed to their new home. From March 6, 1849, to January 1, 1852, the county paid for farm buildings, improvements and superintendence the sum of $20,600. The paupers are properly cared for by the proceeds of the farm, aided when necessary by a county tax. The infirmary building is of brick and stone, two stories high, eighty feet from and thirty feet wide, with a wind of the same size. It is well arranged, properly ventilated, and the building and its surroundings kept in good order. Among the earliest superintendents of the farm were George Campbell, 1849, William Thompson, 1850-53, Enoch Parker and Eden Updike. James McAdoo became superintendent in the year 1885.
With the insane charges of the county a course similar to that formally adopted with respect to paupers was pursued. In the commissioners' records, under the date June 7, 1830 we read: ""This day the commissioners put up John Smith, an insane person, to sale to the lowest bidder; whereupon it appears that John Shriver was the lowest bidder, for which said Shriver agrees to keep said Smith for the time of one year in clothes and good, wholesome food, etc., for the sum of $49.25""
In 1885 it was decided to erect an additional building at the farm in which to keep the incurable insane, and in May, plans, specifications, etc., were presented by H.

The name changed to Infirmary in 1850. Muskingum County’s infirmary was built in 1839 on 200 acres of farmland along Newark Road. After a fire in 1860, the building was rebuilt. The site also hosted a Civil War encampment known as Camp Zanesville.
A replacement was soon sought, and in 1881 a grand structure was built at a cost of $40,000. The building had 112 rooms and featured several towers and a peaked roof. Eventually, the building fell into disrepair, leading to the elimination of the towers and eventual orders by the state fire marshal’s office to repair the building. The brick building soldiered along until it was closed in 2008, with residents transferred to a former privately owned facility, which in turn closed in 2012.

Crist now stands. The institution was closed out in a few years, the property sold and for more than 30 years the county was without an Infirmary. At the October election in 1865, the commissioners submitted to vote a proposition to buy a farm and build an Infirmary, which received 3,206 votes to 1,087 in the negative. On September 8, 1868 the farm in Washington township, four miles from Circleville, on which the Infirmary buildings are located, was purchased from Christopher F. Branstadt  paying $18,000 for 256 acres. The farm of Lewis Lutz, south of Circleville, containing 180 acres, had been purchased the previous year for the purpose, but there were objections and it was sold and another farm selected. The building of the Infirmary  was commenced in 1872 and finished August 1873.
The commissioners having  accepted  the building from contractors, placed  the directors in charge and on the  9th of September  the institution was formally opened. The structure cost $125,000 and was substantially built  under the superintendence  of William Doane, who was the master mechanic and expert builder. The first superintendent and matron were John Morris and his wife , Elizabeth Morris, who continued in the positions until April 1, 1896 - 23 years and  8 months - their administration being completely successful.They were succeeded by  S. M. Yates as superintendent  and his wife, Martha Yates , as matron, who managed the institution judiciously and economically for six years, their successors, Mr. and Mrs. Louis Schneider, the present efficient superintendent and matron, taking charge April 1, 1902. The number of inmates on the 31st of August, 1906, was 64 males and 25 females - less than half the number of inmates until recent years.
Pickaway County had a total of 118 people remaining in the infirmary on September 1, 1879. Of that total, 76 had been received during the year. Four babies were born there, making a total of 198 cared for during the past year. Only 10 inmates had died while 88 were discharged to return to their homes or to find a place to live. None ran away from the institution. Insane people, epileptic, idiotic and children were all taken care of at the infirmary. During the year 1856, a report of deaf and dumb, blind, insane and idiotic people in our county revealed some interesting facts. Of the blind, two lost their sight from exposure, two from fever, one from inflammation, one from cold and one was blind from birth. One person was blind as the result of amaurosis. Causes for idiocy were unknown, but insanity resulted from a fall, fevers, rickets and fits. Most of the people listed were farmers, most uneducated. Relationships of the parents before marriage were also listed, apparently to show some congenital cause for the child's defect. Pickaway reported a total of 32 people who were deaf, blind, insane or idiotic compared to 15 from Hocking County.",,"Stoutsville, OH",,,1873,,,198,118,0

Ohio,Richland County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Richland_County_Infirmary,1845,,,Active,Single Building,,Richland County Home | Dayspring Assisted living Care Facility (Current),"Richland County Commissioners purchased 160 acres to build the first county home in 1845 for the cost of $3,000. Additional land was purchased through the years and, at one time, the county home sat on 320 scenic country acres. Due to a land swap with the state, Dayspring now has 226 acres.
Dayspring was home to the paupers, infirm, disabled, and the insane of the county. Dayspring has been called by several names throughout the years such as The Infirmary, the Poor House, and Richland County Home. In 1995 the name was changed to Dayspring Assisted Living and Care Facility. Dayspring is an unlicensed facility with occupancy of 58 residents. The majority of rooms at Dayspring are private rooms. However, there are a few rooms that are double.
Today, Dayspring is a mix of non, partial, and full paying residents. In 2000, dayspring was approved as a VA Home. Residents from other counties are welcome at Dayspring but they must be a Richland County resident to receive subsidy from the County.

Ohio,Ross County Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ross_County_Home,,,1875,Demolished,Single Building,,Ross County Infirmary,"Ross County established its own poorhouse in 1820. In March 1872, a Scioto Gazette article described the building being used by the county at that time as “a monument of disgrace.” Not long after this article appeared, a contract in the amount of $76,666 was awarded to Hersheiser, Adams, & Co. of Columbus for the construction of a new poorhouse. It did not however include site excavation, bricks, and a few other things, which the county would handle itself. The company agreed to have the facility finished by Jan. 1, 1875. 
The new Ross County Infirmary was located about a half-mile east of the Clarksburg Pike (Ohio 104), five miles or so north of Chillicothe, along what is today Fairgrounds Road. The 1872 Gazette article puts the old 1820 poorhouse in a spot “near” the location that a new one was to be built. The infirmary was designed and the work overseen by well-known local architect John Cook. In an article from November 1874 the Gazette questioned the cost of the new infirmary, which would eventually amount to somewhere in the neighborhood of $100,000.
The infirmary was used to house a variety of paupers. There were the poor and unemployed; widowed and single mothers; people who were sick and had no one to take care of them; undoubtedly some people with mental health issues; and at times entire families. During World War I and the days of Camp Sherman, women with sexually transmitted diseases were guests (inmates might be the more accurate term) in the infirmary in an effort to keep them away from the soldiers until their condition could be successfully treated.
During the 1930s and 1940s and the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, policies on social programming began to change. Unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children, social security and more contributed to the disuse of the infirmary (county home by that time). Few records exist today, but a 1939 survey found that it had just 75 residents, and that the cost per resident had risen by 69 percent since 1934. By the 1950s it was little used and in disrepair. In 1957 it was condemned. No one seems clear on exactly when it was torn down, but the mid-1970s might be an accurate guess.",,"Chillicothe, OH",,,1875,1957,,,75,0

Ohio,Shelby County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Shelby_County_Infirmary,1866,,1869,Active,Single Building,,Fair Haven (Current),"On March 23, 1866 the Shelby County Commissioners bought a farm of 158 acres southwest of Sidney to be used for a County Home farm. The farm was purchased for $8,500. A farmhouse on the grounds was used to accommodate any unfortunates who found their way there until the impressive three –story building was erected in 1869.  The building was brick with a mansard roof and situated back off the main road.  The institution in the beginning housed thirty-eight inmates.  Its structure was designed to hold 90 “paupers,” with a brick building at the rear was intended to house the mentally deficient.  A beautifully kept lawn was in front to the home while the rest of the farm was highly cultivated.  Livestock and crops raised on the farm were used to feed those who resided there.
There were no elevators in the old infirmary.  This made moving residents from floor to floor extremely difficult. Farming operations were still in full swing until the move to the new facility.  Those residents, who wanted to and were able to, worked on the farm.  The residents grew corn, soybeans, wheat and oats, raised cattle, hogs and chickens.  The crops were used to feed the livestock and the residents consumed the meat. Over the years, the old image of the “infirmary” has disappeared.  It slowly changed its image form a home for the poor to a home for the elderly.
In 1969 the first part of the existing county home was completed.  In the early 1970’s the old infirmary was torn down and by 1975, a new wing had already been added to the new county home. Today, Fair Haven has three additional wings to the original building.  Currently, Fair Haven is a 134-bed facility.  One of those wings is used for an Alzheimer/Dementia unit.",,"Sidney, OH",,,1869,1970,90,,38,0

Ohio,Tuscarawas County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tuscarawas_County_Infirmary,1842,,1844/1927,Demolished,Single Building,,Tuscarawas County Home | Colonial Manor,"Counties in Ohio took steps to erect infirmaries after the Ohio General Assembly voted on March 5, 1842, to authorize county commissioners to open “poor houses” in their counties to take care of the indigent. In January 1843, the Tuscarawas County commissioners purchased two farms on what is now University Drive to erect a “poor house.” The building was built at a cost of $3,800 and was completed and accepted by the commissioners on June 6, 1844. Jesse Landes, a native of Goshen Township, was named superintendent of the infirmary in 1854. He was assisted in his duties by his wife, Eliza.
On a Friday afternoon in March 1858, a wooden structure used to house mentally ill patients caught fire at the Tuscarawas County Infirmary outside of New Philadelphia. The inmates in the building, known locally as the “Crazy House,” were locked in their cells, so there was no way for them to escape the flames. All five of the inmates were incinerated, burned beyond recognition. At the time the fire was discovered, there was no “efficient, active man upon the spot,” the newspaper said. Jesse Landes was at a blacksmith shop about a mile away at the time. “Had it been otherwise, it is barely possible that one or two of the unfortunates might have been rescued by knocking in an outside doorway which had been weatherboarded up,” the paper said.
The fire quickly engulfed the building, rescuers were driven back by the flames. Newspaper accounts differed on whether the inmates were still alive at the time. The Ohio Democrat reported that no sound came from the “Crazy House,” “save the crackling of the flames which were rapidly enveloping the dry wooden structure.” The Tuscarawas Advocate provided a more gruesome version. “Their awful yells could be distinctly heard above the crackling of the flames — but they were beyond the reach of any human agency.”
Officials believed that one of the inmates, Matilda Crey, 25, made a rope of her torn clothing and threw it through a grated door to a stove in the hallway. She succeeded in igniting her clothing and setting the building on fire. The Advocate said she was very violent and had tried to set fire to her clothing before she was taken to the infirmary.",,"New Philadelphia, OH",,,[1844],[None],[None],[None],[None],0
Ohio,Union County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Union_County_Infirmary,1848,,1851/1961,Demolished (Original building),Single Building,Jones & Gartner,Union County Home | Union Manor,"In June 1848, Liberty Township in Union County petitioned the County Commissioners for the construction of a poorhouse in that township.  No action was taken on the petition, but the issue of the need for a county poorhouse was duly noted.  A year later on June 7, 1849, the Union County Commissioners, after due consideration, agreed unanimously to levy a tax for the purpose of purchasing land on which to erect a county poor-house, and a tax of one-half mill on the dollar of valuation, for a total of about $850, was ordered.  In December 1850, seventy-five acres of land was purchased from Josiah Kelsey, to be used as a poor-farm.  James McIlroy was awarded the contract for erecting a building on the premise on January 5, 1850, for the sum of $1,400.  McIlroy was subsequently charged with forgery, and the Board of Commissioners re-awarded the contract on March 4, 1850, to James W. Evans, for $1,409.  The building, as constructed, was 40x31 feet in dimension, two stories high, with a hall across the middle; also a wing, one story high, with a cellar under, and a porch in front of the wing eight feet wide; the whole building was constructed of brick.
In the winter of 1866, an amount of land equal to the original purchase was bought from G.W. Kent, making the farm 150 acres.  On May 19, 1870, the Commissioners advertised for proposals for 500,000 brick, and on June 6 authorized the levy of a tax of two mills on the dollar for the purpose of building a new Infirmary.  In July they awarded the brick contract to John Weaver Sr. for $6.50 per 1,000 bricks.  Commissioners Joseph K. Richey and James Fullington along with Infirmary Directors John F. Sabine, Daniel G. Cross and John Guthrie, met and considered plans for the new building on January 30, 1871.  They selected the one presented by Jones & Gartner, architects, of Columbus, Ohio.  On March 31, 1871, the Board of County Commissioners met to consider bid proposals and awarded the contract to R.N. Jones & Company of Delaware, Ohio, for $27,600, not including heating appliances, with C.A. Garrow to superintend the work.  Several changes were made in the plans, and the entire cost, exclusive of heating apparatus, was increased to $29,200.  The building was completed on November 8, 1872.  The new infirmary was a four story structure with a basement and had one hundred rooms, while the old infirmary was utilized as a barn.
In 1883, the infirmary was described as being “one of the finest for the purpose in the State” of Ohio.  In the fall of 1883, the Commissioners decided to build an addition to the infirmary for the purpose of keeping insane individuals.  The contract was let in January 1884 to Brooks & Kemper of Dayton at a cost of $1,570.  The addition was completed later that year.  In June 1895, Samuel Amrine added two verandas to the Infirmary for the cost of $250. On January 1, 1884, the General Assembly prohibited admitting children who were eligible for children’s homes to the infirmary, unless the children were separated from the adult inmates.  This legislation resulted in the creation of the Union County Children’s Home that same year.  Records pertaining to the Union County Children’s Home can be found under the Children’s Home records.  Fourteen years later, it became unlawful to confine the insane and epileptic individuals in the infirmary.
During the Great Depression the Work Progress Administration (WPA) constructed a new porch, resided and painted the woodwork where applicable on the County Home and also demolished in 1937 one unused building on the Infirmary grounds, probably the original infirmary building.  In the spring of 1949, this porch was removed and replaced with a cement and steel porch.
Beginning in the late 1950s discussion began circulating about replacing the nearly ninety year old county home.  The Board of County Commissioner accordingly placed a bond issue for $680,000, $615,000 for the building and $65,000 for equipment, on the November 1958, ballot, which the voters rejected by 317 votes.  A reduced bond levy, this time for only $470,000, was tried again on the November 3, 1959, ballot.  It passed 3,216 to 2,283, with a fifty-nine percent majority.  On December 14, 1959, the Commissioners approved the plans presented by Howard Manor, architect, of Bellefontaine, Ohio.  Knowlton Construction Company of Bellefontaine was awarded the construction contract on June 20, 1960, for the cost of $290,800.  The construction lasted throughout 1960 and 1961, with the Commissioners accepting the new county home, on July 31, 1961.  In January 1962, plans for demolishing the old county home were placed in motion with the contract finally being awarded on September 25, 1962, to Lima Building Wreckers, of Belle Center, Ohio, for $3,600.  The demolition was completed on February 11, 1963.  In July 1966, the commissioners decided to make an addition to the county home, which was completed in the spring of 1968.  This final addition made the facility into a 32,000 square foot structure with ninety beds.  On April 19, 1976, the name was formally changed from the Union County Home to Union Manor.
On January 1, 1995, the County Commissioners relinquished control of Union Manor to Memorial Hospital of Union County.  The old county home proved to be inadequate and discussions began whether to conduct a major remodel of Union Manor or to construct a new facility.  It was decided to build a new building at Green Pastures in Marysville.  Bids went out in May 1999 and construction began in August of that same year.  The final cost for the 54,000 square foot facility came in at $8.2 million.  On April 1, 2001, Union Manor was officially closed and all the patients were transferred to the new facility, The Gables at Green Pastures.",2001,"Marysville, OH",,,1872,2001,90,,,0

A two-story brick building called the Warren County Infirmary was built on East Street near Lebanon. Eleven residents moved in on April 13, 1831. Twenty two people were occupants at the end of the year. The property was a working farm. In The Centennial Atlas of Warren County, Ohio, 1903 it states the farm once had more land but at that time had one hundred and eight tillable acres on which corn, potatoes, cabbages, turnips, melons, tomatoes, and other vegetables were grown for the inhabitants. An orchard provided fruit. Animals were also raised: pigs for pork and Durham cattle for beef.
Soon more room was needed in the main building so an addition was added in 1836. The mentally ill had been housed with the poor but this was found to not be ideal. In 1845 a small brick building was built near the infirmary to serve them. A fire in Dec. 31, 1866, destroyed the infirmary, but there was no loss of life. A new building was built in 1867. It was designed by Capt. William H. Hamilton, a county commissioner. The structure was three stories tall with a full basement. It contained 70 apartments with a center court featuring a fountain.
In 1900 the mental health patients were moved to the Dayton State Hospital. The boilers for a steam pipe heat system were installed in the building they had occupied. Heat was piped underground to the main building. In spite of these precautions, a fire destroyed the infirmary on Nov. 2, 1915. Sixty patients were in residence but all were able to escape without injury. The residents were temporarily placed in various locations.
On July 19, 1917, a new infirmary was completed. It was constructed on the same site as the former structure. Lady’s quarters were located on the north side of the building and men’s on the south. The basement area contained the kitchen and dining rooms. The second floor provided residence for the superintendent and his family and the employees. A chapel was in the northwest corner and had a reed organ. On the third floor was a hospital with an operating room, five wards for general use and one for contagious diseases.

Ohio,Wood County Infirmary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wood_County_Infirmary,1865,,1869,Preserved,,,,"When boards of county commissioners were instructed by the Ohio General Assembly to designate a portion of taxpayer funds for the construction for poor houses, little was realized about the depth of knowledge needed to maintain a public charity building and those that inhabited the structure. Although Wood County was incorporated in 1820, it was not until 1863 that county commissioners entertained the idea of constructing a building specifically for community members who required permanent public charity assistance.
Wood County is divided up into nineteen townships.  People needing public charity relief filled out an application for relief with their local township trustee.  To qualify for relief an applicant was required to live within the county for one year.  If the applicant did not live in the county for one year, the legal county of residence was determined and required to reimburse the contributing county.  Applicants needing temporary help in the form of money to pay medical bills, buy food or clothing, pay for burial, or obtain other necessities of life were awarded outdoor relief and did not live at the county managed infirmary.  If an individual or family required relief considered permanent, then township trustees would discontinue outdoor relief and grant indoor relief or admission to live at the county poorhouse.
Opening in 1869, Thomas C. Reid managed the infirmary until 1877 when E.M. Jenkins assumed the role of superintendent.  Jenkins position was short lived and in 1878 the county commissioners hired Edwin and Charlotte Farmer to manage the poorhouse.   Over the course of 26 years, Edwin and Charlotte raised their four children: Alfred, Warren, Lottie, and Rose, at the infirmary.  In 1904 when Edwin died suddenly, their daughter Lottie and her husband Frank Brandeberry took over as Superintendent and Matron until 1949 when age and declining health forced the couple into retirement.  The Farmer and Brandeberry families managed the Wood County Infirmary for 72 out of the 102 years the original site of the poorhouse cared for the counties indigent.
Built in 1885 for $1,700.00, the Lunatic Asylum was designed to house mentally ill male residents. The first eight patients were transferred here in 1886 from the Perrysburg Insane Farm. By 1900, Ohio legislation mandated that all mentally ill patients transfer to state hospitals, which changed the focus of the facility to dormitory space for trustworthy male residents. Evidence of remodeling occurred between 1925 and 1940, most likely to accommodate more residents as a result of the Great Depression
A majority of recommendations made by the Ohio State Board of Charities occurred during the Farmer/Brandeberry years of service, making their story the focus of this chapter on Wood County, Ohio. The original infirmary building closed in 1971 and the site reemerged in 1975 as the Wood County Museum.  The Wood County Historical Society maintain institutional archives related to the former county infirmary.
The Ohio State Board of Charities recommended all county infirmaries set aside at least an acre of land for pauper burials.  The Wood County Infirmary Cemetery was used from 1870 until the late 1940s.  In 2019, the Wood County Museum, with the help of the Wood County Genealogical Society, identified 252 confirmed burials and dedicated a monument noting the people buried in the cemetery.  Additional identifications of the deceased continue to be located and are documented.  Records of those who either died at the county home or, due to financial circumstances, were place in a pauper grave do exist and are stored in the archives of The Wood County Museum.",1971,"Bowling Green, OH",,,1869,1971,,,,0

Over the years, the homestead raised Holstein cattle that supplied dairy products.  There was also a field for planting and raising crops.  The farm was managed by the male residents.  The residents harvested a great number of crops that the kitchen staff, consisting of female residents, prepared.  The crops also were a source of income to support the home’s operation.",,"Upper Sandusky, OH",,,[1869],[None],[None],[None],[None],0
