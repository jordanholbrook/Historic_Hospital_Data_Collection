The asylum was the product of a collaborative effort between the state and two private citizens, Reuel Williams of Augusta (married to Sarah Cony) and Benjamin Brown of Vassalborough. While early mental health institutions may fall far short of present-day standards for treatment for mental illness, the establishment of such places in the early nineteenth century was based, in part, on reforming care for the mentally ill.
Prior to mental health hospitals, the mentally ill were the responsibility of their families, and if their families could not cope, they were either put in poor houses, put out on the streets, or locked away in jail. Mental health reformer Dorothea Dix (1802-1887), a native of Hampden, Maine, worked closely with the second superintendent of the Augusta asylum, Issac Ray (appointed in 1841). The building was state-of-the-art when constructed. All parts had ventilation, lighting, heating, and water. Men and women had separate wings.
Over its 162 years of service, the hospital has carried a number of names and today it is called the Augusta Mental Health Institute. Many buildings on the campus now serve as state offices. A new hospital,Riverview Psychiatric Center, was opened in 2004 to replace the facility.

Maine,Bangor State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bangor_State_Hospital,,1895.0,,Active,Pavilion Plan,,Eastern Maine Insane Hospital | Bangor Mental Health Institute | Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center,"From the hospital's official state web page:
The Eastern Maine Insane Hospital was opened on July 1, 1901. It was built on a pastoral hill named 'Hepatica Hill' for its flowers overlooking the city of Bangor and the Penobscot River. Pine trees were planted around all of the driveways on the campus and have since grown to enormous sizes.
Within five days of opening in 1901, 145 patients were transferred from the Maine Insane Hospital in Augusta to the Bangor location. Patients were generally committed to the hospital by their community peers, such as town selectmen, family, etc.
Patients worked the fields, raised livestock, manned the laundry, sewing room and kitchen as part of their ""treatment."" This made the hospital self-sufficient and any excesses were sold at market to pay additional costs, until 1973 when the case of Sonder vs. Brennan went to court and it was determined that patients in public institutions could not work without being paid.
The name of the hospital changed in 1913 to Bangor State Hospital and then eventually to Bangor Mental Health Institute in the early 70's. The highest patient census was in 1970 with 1,200 patients; however, with a concerted downsizing effort in the 70's, the census fell to 470 in 1974. There were approximately 300 patients through much of the 80's.
Treatment for patients ranged from 'family' type care in the early 1900's to hydrotherapy and electrical therapies in the 1930's. The hydrotherapy and electrical therapies, however, were only used for a small number of patients. Most patients, who were thought to be incurable, received little specific treatment for their problems. New effective medications for mental illness became available in the mid 50's.
On August 26, 2005 BMHI name was changed to Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center.

Maine,Maine School for Feeble Minded,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Maine_School_for_Feeble_Minded,1907.0,,1908.0,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Pownal State School | Pineland Hospital and Training Center | The Pineland Center,"From 1907 when the Maine Legislature decided to establish a school for ""idiotic and feeble-minded"" children until 1996 when that institution closed its doors, doctors, social workers, parents, legislators and community advocates discussed and debated the nature of the problem of developmental disabilities in children and adults and the best way for the state to care for those individuals. The enabling legislation passed in 1907 specified that the residents of the new facility would be between ages 3 and 21. When the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded opened, the ""patients"" lived at Hill Farm on the New Gloucester property. As the population of the facility grew rapidly, so did the building of large dormitories. Gray and Staples halls were the first dorms. Planners had thought residents would live in small units, but that was not practical due to the ever-growing number of residents.
The population grew rapidly for several reasons. First, some medical personnel and caregivers had a goal of sending all developmentally disabled persons to institutions. Also, judges sometimes send people to the facility because they were poor or orphans with no one to care for them. In one well-known case, the state removed residents of Malaga Island off Phippsburg from the island in 1912. Many of the residents were mixed race and some, when removed from the island, were sent to the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded. Graves in the cemetery at Malaga were dug up and reinterred at the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded cemetery.
At times the residents of the institution were largely forgotten by most people in Maine. At other times, they and the facility were closely scrutinized. The history of Pineland offers insights into Maine's treatment of persons with disabilities and a window into national movements and beliefs about such care over nearly a century. Further, the institution never kept to the original legislation specifying that it would serve those ages 3-21. Older persons were residents and few people left at any age, at least legally. Over the years, many residents escaped from the facility, some permanently.
The post World War I era changed ideas about care for persons with developmental issues -- in Maine and elsewhere. At the New Gloucester facility, a new superintendent, Dr. Stephen Vosburg, arrived in 1919. He brought with him new ideas about the facility's population and appropriate treatments. America viewed persons with developmental problems as potential criminals and dangerous to society. These ideas affected how communities and institutions dealt with persons with developmental disabilities. For example, many professionals believed that retardation was hereditary. The method to stop the ""spread"" of mental retardation was sterilization. It was an era of a belief in eugenics: selective human reproduction to ensure that the ""best"" people with the ""best"" genes reproduced -- and those with ""defective"" traits would not reproduce. Vosburg argued in favor of sterilization for what he called the ""subnormal"" population in Maine.
In 1925, a state law permitted sterilizations of persons deemed to be mentally deficient. Also in 1925, the facility Vosburg headed changed its name to the Pownal State School, dropping what had become an out-of-date term, ""feeble-minded."" Along with eugenics, the post World War I era brought the use of intelligence testing. The tests differentiated levels of disability and hence, suggested different care options. Still, most doctors urged parents of children born with developmental problems to place them in institutions immediately after birth.
In the 1930s, while institutions like Pownal State School continued to grow, many began to realize that changes were needed. First, it was too expensive and impractical to think of institutionalizing everyone who had developmental disabilities. Some professionals began considering the benefits of community-based care for those with less severe disabilities. This included the idea of ""special education"" in public schools for those children who could function in the community. In addition, education was stressed more for some residents of Pownal State School. The institution provided elementary level academic training as well as training in many skills: residents worked on one of the two farms, in the kitchen, the laundry and the hospital. Girls and women learned sewing and other crafts and boys and men learned a variety of manual skills -- all tailored to the ability of the person. The school had a woodshop and print shop and some students learned how to repair machinery of various types.
Pownal also had Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops that participated in parades and other events outside of the institution, as well as giving members opportunities within the school. While the stigma of developmental problems would remain for many years, these activities suggested to residents and the community outside of Pownal State School that developmental problems did not equate with ""criminal"" or ""dangerous"" behavior. A new era of care had begun as a new term, ""mental deficiency,"" was being used.
Funding was tight, but the population of the school continued to grow, reaching about 1,100 by the end of the 1930s. The growth was fueled, in part, by the use of Pownal State School to house people without economic means, problem youths and others who did not meet the intent of the facility. Dr. Nessib S. Kupelian, who served as superintendent of Pownal from 1938 to 1953, envisioned Pownal State School growing to serve more than 7,000 residents. In 1939, there were 51 buildings and some 200 employees. The facility was like a small city with its own water system, farms and power plant.
In the post-World War II era, Pownal State School, like many other institutions was increasingly in the public's awareness as commissions, interested citizen groups, former patients and former employees criticized conditions within the facility or raised questions about its method or effectiveness. Gov. Frederick Payne, at the suggestion of the Maine Federation of Women's Clubs, appointed a visitation committee that reported on Pownal State School in January 1951. The report was quite critical. It cited instances of abuse of residents and a lack of constructive work on their behalf. Kupelian and other staff defended their institution and the Maine Legislature appropriated funds for staff increases and other changes.
New buildings were built, including Bliss and Kupelian halls, which opened in 1949, and housed hundred of children in open wards. In later years, Kupelian would come under fire for poor conditions ""warehousing"" residents. In 1957, the facility became the Pineland Hospital and Training Center. The name suggested the new focus: Bowman, like his predecessors, was a medical doctor, and believed in a medical model of treatment. He added a dentist and psychiatric employees. The name of the facility became ""Pineland Hospital and Training Center."" All reference or labels about the ""condition"" of the residents was gone.
By 1970, Pineland had lost its accreditation and, in 1971, Bowman lost his job as superintendent. In 1973, the facility's name was changed yet again. ""Pineland Center"" as it was now known had dropped any reference to ""medical"" as well as to ""disability."" The national trend of deinstitutionalization and community-based care affected Pineland. The patient population decreased to fewer than 500 by the mid-1970s. Pineland stayed in the public eye. Again, national trends played out in Maine as Pine Tree Legal Assistance filed a class action suit in 1975 alleging that Pineland did not provide adequate care. The suit resulted in a consent decree in 1978 that created care standards and set a goal for a smaller institution. The institution's progress was monitored by the courts until 1981. Criticisms of poor care continued, however, and, along with continuing changes in philosophies of care for developmentally handicapped persons and rising costs, led to a state decision in 1991 to close Pineland. It closed in 1996.

The French-Canadian Sisters of Charity was a group of nuns who traveled from Montreal to Lewiston Maine to provide health and social support for the French-Canadian population in the area. Healey Asylum began as an orphanage and housed approximately 100 children, most of whom were in 5-7 years old. [1] Historical records suggest that it was debatable as to whether the facility cared specifically for children with mental health diseases.
Restoration efforts began in the new millennium to turn the asylum into affordable income housing. The project, now called Intown Manor, was lead by Sutherland Conservation and Consulting in Augusta Maine, worked with the National Park Service to design housing that maintained the building's historic character, while modernizing the facility into specialized housing. An informational portfolio from Sutherland explians:
""The rehabilitation project created 22 apartments with community rooms utilizing existing spaces in the main building and adjacent boiler and former laundry building, giving each unit a unique floor plan. The former chapel on the second floor was rehabilitated into two units while maintaining the decorative moldings and restoring those that had been nearly lost in previous renovations. The boiler house and former laundry building on the site now contains two apartments and offices for a non-profit community organization. The rehabilitation work meets Maine State Housing’s Green Building energy efficiency standards, with upgraded systems, new insulation, and solar panels.""[2]
According to Bagala Window Works, a company based in Falmouth, ME working on the restoration:
""Bagala Window works is restoring original window sash as part of the transformation of this former children’s orphanage into 32 affordable elderly apartment units. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979 and will be rehabilitated, in part, with tax credit equity from Historic Tax Credit (HTC) programs.

What began as little more than a tent city, the treatment center constructed wooden buildings in 1912 which were destroyed by fire in 1913. In time with new construction the hospital grew to include a children's section and a surgical wing.
In 1915, the state took over both the Chase Memorial Sanatorium and the Maine State Sanatorium in Hebron, Maine renaming them the Central Maine Sanatorium and Western Maine Sanatorium. Patients who were the sickest went to Central Maine. Those for whom a cure was deemed probable were assigned to the Hebron hospital.  A third tuberculosis hospital was also authorized at this time in Presque Isle and named the Northern Maine Sanatorium.

There were three patient buildings, the Powers Building, for men, with 30 beds, completed in 1920, the Wilson Building, for women, with 48 beds, completed in 1922 and the Knight Building, for children, with 42 beds, completed in 1924.

Officially, it was the Maine Sanatorium Association that created the new institution, but Dr. Estes Nichols provided the expertise in tuberculosis treatment and the energy and vision behind the new venture.
Nichols claimed to have visited all the sanatoriums in the United States and Canada and planned to build one on a mountain in rural Maine that would surpass any he had seen. He and the Association hired Portland architects John Calvin Stevens and John Howard Stevens, planned the farm that would feed patients and spread the word about what constituted effective treatment for the disease that had been known as consumption. The climate on Greenwood Mountain was as important as the design of the buildings and the methods of treatment.
Until 1915 when the state took over control of the sanatorium, Dr. Nichols continued to raise money, oversee care of patients, deal with the Legislature, correspond with potential patients, and handle the day-to-day operations of the ever-growing facility. In 1915, the state passed a law to provide for the care and treatment of tubercular persons in three state-operated state sanatoriums. The state took over the private hospitals in Hebron and Fairfield and built a new facility in Presque Isle. The sanatoriums were given geographical designations -- Western Maine Sanatorium, Central Maine Sanatorium, and Northern Maine Sanatorium. The state capped patient bills at $5 per week.
Wealthier people with TB in Maine probably went to private sanatoriums, in Maine or elsewhere in the country. Some of these facilities were much like resorts. Especially popular were sanatoriums in the southwest, where the warm, dry air was believed to be better for the damaged lungs of TB patients.
The era of state-operated tuberculosis facilities in Maine lasted from 1915 until 1969. From the time the state took over in 1915, the Central Maine Sanatorium was designated as the facility where surgeries were performed and where patients with more advances cases of TB were sent. Presque Isle took patients of all types and performed surgery because of the difficulty of transporting patients from northern to central Maine. Hebron and Presque Isle both closed in 1959.",1959.0,"Hebron,ME",,,1915,1959,,,,0
