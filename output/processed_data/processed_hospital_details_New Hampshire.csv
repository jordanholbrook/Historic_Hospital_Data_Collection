New Hampshire,Concord State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Concord_State_Hospital,1838.0,1841.0,"Oct 29, 1842",ActivePreserved (Original Building),Pre-1854 Plans,Elias Carter,New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane | New Hampshire State Hospital  | New Hampshire Hospital (Current),"About the year 1830 the condition of the insane of New Hampshire began to awaken a deep interest in the hearts of philanthropic persons in all sections of the state. As the public interest in the subject deepened, a settled conviction was formed in leading minds that the state should take the initiative in whatever measures might be adopted. Influenced in part, perhaps, by this general sentiment, but feeling deeply the importance of the enterprise, Governor Dinsmore, in his message to the Legislature in June, 1832, thus called attention to the condition of the insane:
""I feel no apology need be made, in an age so distinguished for its public and private charities, for calling your attention to a subject which has so much reason and humanity on its side as a measure for the security and recovery of the lunatic or insane. The Legislature of the state has never yet recognized these unfortunate beings as entitled to any special favor from the government.""
He also recommended, as a preparatory step, the institution of an inquiry:
""To ascertain, with as much exactness as practicable, the whole number of insane within the state, distinguishing paupers from others, the number which have been committed to jail within a given time by authority of court, or by their friends or others, without the order or sanction of judicial proceedings, and the length of their respective terms of confinement; and to ascertain, in like manner, the actual or probable amount of cost of court and jailers' fees, and expenses of their support and maintenance in cases of confinement.""
In accordance with this recommendation, the Governor was directed ""To take proper means to ascertain the number of insane persons in the state.""
In his message at the opening of the winter session, Governor Dinsmore made the following report:
""In 141 towns, being all from which returns have been received, the whole number of insane is 189—90 males and 99 females—one-third of whom are paupers. The whole of those now in confinement is 76, of whom 25 are in private houses, 34 in poorhouses, seven in cells and cages, six in chains and irons, and four in jail. Of those not now in confinement many were stated to have been at times secured in private houses; some have been handcuffed; others have been confined in cells, and some in chains and jails.""
In pursuit of the Governor's recommendation, a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives ""For the establishment of the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane."" This was read twice, laid upon the table, and, on the 28th day of December, indefinitely postponed by a vote of 139 to 78. Upon the assembling of the next Legislature, in 1833, Governor Dinsmore again alluded to the subject in his message, and said, in relation to the establishment of an asylum for the insane:
""Although your predecessors did not feel prepared to sanction the measures recommended, I have never lost the hope of seeing at an early period zealous co-operation of the several branches of the government with the friends of suffering humanity in promoting a charity so plainly recommended by the principles of our religion and by every consideration of justice and philanthropy.""
On the 20th day of June of that year a resolution was introduced into the House of Representatives authorizing the appointment of an agent to examine and inspect sundry asylums for the insane and ""Report a plan for an asylum in this state."" The resolution was passed and sent to the Senate, where, in a few days afterwards, its further consideration was postponed to the next session of the Legislature. Another resolution was introduced appropriating $10,000 "" for the erection of an insane hospital,"" the further consideration of which was postponed to the next session of the Legislature.
Upon the opening of the session of 1834 Governor Badger warmly urged in his message the importance of taking some measures for alleviating the existing conditions of the insane. A resolution for an appropriation by the state of the sum of 812,500 for the erection of an asylum for the insane was again postponed to the next session of the Legislature. Later a resolution was passed which required the selectmen of the several towns to make return to the Secretary of State of the number and condition of the insane in their respective towns and districts. ft is noteworthy that the friends of the insane were not discouraged, but obtained the use of the Hall of Representatives for a lecture from Dr. William Perry upon the condition and wants of the insane of the state.
In the following year a resolution was introduced appropriating 25 bank shares for the asylum for the insane, but it was defeated. The following year the question was again brought up by the Governor and a committee was appointed to report on such portions of the Governor's message as referred to provision for the insane. It is interesting to notice that the report given by Dr. Luther V. Bell is very harrowing in its details as to the condition of the insane in the almshouses and receptacles of the state, but action was again postponed. A few days later, upon the occasion of a resolution appropriating bank shares for the erection of an asylum, a resolution was passed directing the Governor to take the sense of the qualified voters of the state upon the question, ""Is it expedient for the state to grant an appropriation to build an insane hospital?"" At the next session of the Legislature it was found that less than one-half the voters of the state had expressed any opinion, and the bills as far as received indicated that there was no decided majority in favor of the step. For a year, in consequence of the financial stress in all parts of the country, no effort was made to agitate the question.
In 1838, a bill for the establishment of an asylum was passed and the long struggle of more than six years was over. This bill was in the form of a charter to establish a corporation known as the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane. The corporation had power to hold real and personal property for any amount necessary for its support, provided that this income from real and personal estate should not exceed $30,000. There were 39 incorporators. The institution was placed under the management of a board of 12 trustees, three of whom should vacate their office yearly and eight of these trustees were elected by the corporation and four by a Board of Visitors. It was further provided that the sum of $15,000 should be secured to the institution by individuals before any money should come from the state. If these conditions were met 30 shares of New Hampshire bank stock, worth about $18,000, were to be given to the institution. As might have been anticipated, difficulties arose almost at once in the corporation between the subscribers to the voluntary fund and the trustees appointed by the state. It accordingly became necessary for the Legislature to act and provide that the direction, management and control of all the property and concerns of the asylum should be vested in trustees without power of interference on the part of the corporation. It was finally in 1840 deemed best to put the whole institution under the control of 12 trustees, to be appointed by the Governor and council. The Legislature also provided at the same time that all the contributions by private individuals, previously made, should be returned to them if claimed before a certain time.
The asylum was located in 1841 in the Town of Concord, because the town had given the sum of $9500 to secure the location. Private individuals also contributed in addition to this sum. The Building Committee entered upon its duties at once and n October, 1842, procured the completion of a portion of the present center building with accommodations for 96 patients. The whole amount expended for the farm of 121 acres, the erection of the hospital and outbuildings, furniture, stock, etc., was $36,277.70. Of this sum $19,000 had been paid by the state, the balance being received in contributions by the town and citizens of Concord, the Society of Shakers and other benevolent individuals.
The asylum was opened for the reception of patients on the 29th day of October, 1842, under the superintendency of Dr. George Chandler, who in June following reported to the trustees the admission of 76 patients during the previous seven months. Dr. Chandler remained at the head of the institution for about three years, and to him it is largely indebted for the initiation of a wise routine of management. He was succeeded in 1845 Dv Dr. Andrew McFarland, afterwards superintendent of the Illinois Asylum for the Insane, who discharged the duties of superintendent for about seven years and resigned in the summer of 1852. In 1849 the Chandler wing was built, named in honor of Dr. George Chandler.
Dr. McFarland was succeeded by Dr. John E. Tyler, who held the office for a period of about four years and a half. During his superintendency the first portion of the Peaslee building was erected in 1854; steam fixtures for warming the halls and other parts of the house were introduced in 1855; and in consequence of increasing applications for admission, the Rumford wing was erected the same year, thereby increasing the limit of accommodations to 225 patients.
In consequence of impaired health Dr. Tyler resigned in 1857 and was succeeded by Dr. Jesse P. Bancroft. Dr. Bancroft's period of service was a long one, extending from 1857 to 1883. It was also an active one, during which no less than seven important buildings were added to those previously in use. The first of these, in order of construction, was the Kent building, erected in 1867. This is the corresponding building, on the female side of the asylum, to the Peaslee building, on the male side. It embodies most of the advanced ideas pertaining to the custody of highly excited patients prevailing at the time of its erection, and is still well abreast of the present period in this respect.
The greatly enlarged number of patients in 1868 rendered necessary a new kitchen, bakery, cellar, dining room for employees, sewing room and chapel. These wants were all supplied in the present chapel building, which was built that year. The ventilation of the buildings proved more and more defective as time elapsed and numbers increased. To remedy this defect, Dr. Bancroft devised a new system for the halls and rooms in 1869. The enlargement of the asylum structure on the south brought into very objectionable contiguity the barn and stable of the institution. The necessity for larger structures of this character, better planned and more remotely located, was met in 1871 by the removal and reconstruction of the barn and stable upon the sites which they now occupy.
In 1874 the Peaslee building was beyond capacity and lacking important conveniences. Its accommodations having become insufficient rather than unsuitable, it was enlarged to double its size and furnished with additional conveniences as the most advanced treatment of highly excited patients required.
Three years later it became apparent that the asylum had outgrown its boiler house and repair shops, and that a new structure to meet these wants had become imperative. A new boiler house and work shops were accordingly constructed in 1877.
The central building of the asylum had been enlarged twice. Its accommodations were first increased, in 1860, by an addition of some 36 feet upon the west; an additional story was put upon it in 1879. These additions have doubled its original capacity.
The Bancroft building was erected in 1882. This was suggested partly by the need of additional room on the female side of the asylum and partly by a desire on the part of the friends of a somewhat limited class of patients in the state for more ample accommodations and a more private life than is usually found practicable at institutions for the insane.
In its plan of construction this was an advance on all the others. Previously the more agitated and irresponsible classes had been amply provided for in the older buildings, but not so the convalescent and those not needing restraint. The partially self sustaining patients had been associated with more or less incompatible classes for lack of sufficient variety in apartments. So, also, persons with ample means and needing no other than moral restraint had not found, in the older buildings, sufficiently liberal accommodations to satisfy their habits and tastes. Both these classes have been provided for in the construction of this building.
Then followed the Twitchell building for convalescent and appreciative men patients, the summer cottages at Lake Penacook, constituting a beginning of a colony four miles distant from the hospital itself, the north pavilion and the south pavilion for chronic men and women patients, the additions to the Kent and Peaslee buildings for the more disturbed patients of either sex, the hospital building for the admission of new patients and the care of such as need hospital nursing; and, lastly, a group in process of erection for the care of quiet patients of either sex of the industrial class.
The New Hampshire Hospital is located in the very heart of the City of Concord, upon a tract of ground of about 125 acres. Some 25 acres of this are occupied by the various buildings and airing courts; the remainder by the pond, farming areas, groves, avenues and paths. In addition to the ground about the house, the asylum owns a pasture of 50 acres about half a mile distant.
One of the greatest boons enjoyed by the institution is that of an unlimited supply of purest water. This comes from a well sunk by Dr. Bancroft upon the premises in 1880, which has a diameter of 50 feet and a depth of 15. It is drawn upon daily for about 50,000 gallons, and is capable of yielding a much larger supply.
In 1855, as before stated, the furnaces which had been previously employed were discarded and appliances for warming the buildings by steam were introduced. Up to 1870, wood was the fuel used, but this growing more and more dear in price and its supply more and more uncertain, it gave way to coal, which has been the fuel used for the last 15 years.
After an active service of 25 years Dr. Bancroft resigned the superintendency in 1882, and was succeeded by his son, Dr. Charles P. Bancroft.
There have been many private donors, and the legacies which from time to time have been given the institution early assumed sizable proportions. The institution was fortunate in securing these many bequests, for it is doubtful whether it could have been established as early as it was without them. The large donations to the asylum had one bad effect: they rather tended to withdraw public interest from the institution and the Legislature was too prone to rely on the income from the funds for maintenance of the new institution rather than upon legislative appropriations.
In 1837, before the opening of the asylum, Miss Catharine Fiske, of Keene, a lady of high culture and benevolent impulses, bequeathed to it a legacy of nearly $6000, charged with certain temporary annuities, since terminated. By the terms of her will this bequest was not to be paid to the asylum until the expiration of 50 years from the time of her decease. It became payable in 1887 and amounted at that time to over $23,000.
In 1846 and at subsequent times the state, as trustee for the asylum, received in partial payments from the estate of Jacob Kimball, of Hampstead, a legacy amounting to $6743.49, the interest of which is annually paid by the State Treasurer to the asylum.
Again in 1847 Samuel Bell, of Chester, made to the asylum generous donations of money, to be expended in the purchase of books for the use of patients. With this some 250 volumes of standard works, well suited to the purpose intended, were procured. These formed the nucleus about which the present asylum library has grown. The important additions since made have resulted from numerous smaller and later gifts. This collection of books, now containing about 1800 volumes, is of great value as a curative agency in the treatment of large numbers of convalescent and mildly affected patients.
Two years afterward, in 1849, me institution received as a contribution to its fund the sum of $200 from John Williams, of Hanover. Abiel Chandler, of Walpole, the founder of the Chandler Scientific School at Hanover, who died in 1851, bequeathed to the asylum two legacies—one of $600, charged with the lifeestate of a niece, and another of $1000, at the same time making the institution his residuary legatee. The several sums, paid to its treasurer from time to time by his executors, amounted to 827,631.15. The ultimate amount of this fund, which bears the name of its donor, has been fixed by the trustees at $30,000, and, already increased by the addition to it of interest, stands upon the books of the institution at $29,800.
The Countess of Rumford, who died at Concord in December, 1852, was also a benefactress of the asylum. Feeling a deep interest in this and other benevolent institutions in her native state and elsewhere, at her decease she left to such a very large proportion of her estate. To her the asylum is indebted for a legacy of $15,000, which was paid in 1853.
Benjamin Thompson taught school in Concord three years previous to the Revolution. He married Mrs. Sarah, the young widow of Benjamin Rolfe, and a daughter of the Rev. Timothy Walker, minister to the First Parish of Penacook, now Concord. Of this union was born October, 1774, a daughter, who some years later inherited the title of Countess of Rumford on her father's death. After being suspected of Toryism, Benjamin Thompson left Concord and was sent by General Gage to England. His first wife having died, the daughter followed her father to Europe, where she lived with him in Paris and London. She returned to Concord in 1845, where she died. She had accumulated considerable property, leaving at her death money to found the Rolfe and Rumford Asylum for Children in Concord, and $15,000 to the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane, which was the beginning of the invested funds now held by the institution.
Mr. Joseph Walker, of Concord, for 60 years one of the trustees of the hospital, was a lineal descendant of the minister, Timothy Walker, and he now lives in the house which was occupied by Timothy Walker himself. A portrait of the Countess of Rumford hangs in the chapel of the hospital.
Mrs. Mary Danforth, of Boscawen, who also died in 1852, after making other specific bequests, left to the asylum the residuum of her estate. From this the sum of $347.90 was realized by the institution.
One of the early trustees of the asylum was William Plumer, of Londonderry, who ever manifested a deep concern in its welfare. It was found after his decease that, retaining this interest to the last, he had left to it a legacy of $500, which was paid in 1863. Still another benefactress of the asylum was Mrs. Peggy Fuller, of Francestown, from whose estate it received in 18621863 the sum of $1814.42. In 1862 the institution received from the executors of the will of Mrs. Fanny S. Sherman, of Exeter, a lady of great excellence of character, a legacy of $5000, the annual income of which is, by her direction, given to indigent patients, to assist them in paying the necessary expenses of their support, and is the first bequest ever received by the asylum to which any particular direction has been attached by the donor. Some five years later a legacy of $202.10 was paid to the asylum by the executors of Horace Hall, of Charlestown. The largest bequest ever made to the asylum was the munificent one of Moody Kent, who died in 1866. Having watched its progress with great interest for a long series of years, he left it at his decease the residue of his property, after the payment of numerous legacies to relatives and friends. From this estate the institution received $149,414, which sum, increased by a small addition derived from accrued interest now constitutes the present Kent fund of $150,000.
The Rev. Charles Burroughs, D. D., of Portsmouth, who for about 13 years had held the office of president of the Board of Trustees, left at his decease in March, 1868, a bequest of $1000 to be paid to the institution at the close of the life of Mrs. Burroughs. Isaac Adams, of Sandwich, after having served the institution for several years with signal ability as one of its trustees, upon retiring from the board, in 1868, accompanied his resignation with the liberal gift of $1000, requesting that the interest might be expended in affording means of indoor recreation to male patients so situated as to be deprived of it in the open air.
In 1872 John Conant, of Jaffrey, the constructing agent of the first asylum building, for many years a member of its Board of Trustees and for six years its president, gave a donation of S6000 as an addition to its permanent fund. The third on the list of female patrons of the institution was Miss Arabella Rice, of Portsmouth, who died in 1872 and left to it a legacy of $20,000.
Isaac Spalding, of Nashua, for many years a member of the Board of Trustees and from 1868 to 1875 its president, died in the latter year, leaving to the asylum a legacy of $10,000 as his contribution to its permanent funds.
In 1883 the asylum received a legacy of $1000 from the estate of Miss H. Louise Penhallow, of Portsmouth. In 1885 another of $1000 was received from the estate of Mrs. Rhoda C. Piper, of Hanover, and in 1886 still another of $500 from that of Mrs. Betsy S. Smith, of New Ipswich, which is the last which has come into the treasury.
The whole amount of the asylum's permanent funds on the 15th day of April, 1886, was $270,230.20.
One word may be added in regard to the application of the income from the funds. This has been largely used for assisting indigent insane patients. There are many people throughout the state, chiefly of the farming classes, who very much desire to maintain their relatives at the hospital, but who would be unable to do this unless assisted in some way financially. It was the intention of many of the donors of these funds to assist poor people who were ambitious to care for their relatives but who, without assistance, would find the burden a large one. Accordingly the trustees have for many years divided the income from the legacies among deserving worthy cases. These donations have prevented many deserving people throughout the state from awning to pauperism, and have realized the beneficent intention of one of the largest donors, who said that he wished to leave his money where it would do the greatest possible good to the largest number of people for the longest possible time.
From the time of the admission of the first patient, October 29, 1842, to March 31, 1886, a period of 43 years, 5 months and 2 days, 4,890 persons were admitted to the asylum and received its care. Of this number, 1,777 were ""cured"" and able to resume their places in society. A further 1,139 persons under care and treatment, but who did not fully recover mental health, left the institution for care in family settings. Of this class, a considerable number were convalescent on leaving, and fully recovered afterwards. The records show only 878 discharged whose diseases were not either removed or mitigated. 776 have died at the asylum since its opening. Total population of the asylum in 1916 is 960, and there are about 100 left in the various almshouses.
In hospital construction since the year 1882 the detached pavilion plan has been the favorite method of construction adopted by the trustees. The Twitchell house, the Bancroft building, the hospital building, and the new group for working patients are all detached buildings connected with the main building by long subways for the economical distribution of heat, water and electricity. In the convalescent buildings for both men and women every attempt has been made to secure the conditions of the private house and home as far as is possible.
At the farm colony an attempt has been made to establish conditions of life exactly as they exist on the ordinary New England farm. Much has been done in the culture of small fruits, in the raising of chickens and eggs, as well as the care of stock. It is to be hoped in the near future, when sufficient land is acquired in this locality, that a milk farm can be maintained. A nucleus has already been started in the building of a modern cow barn at this farm.
Shortly after 1886, 230 acres of land were purchased at Lake Penacook, four miles distant from the main building, and cottages were constructed. Two of these cottages are used for summer occupation only, and a third is open the year round for working farm patients. This latter cottage is the nucleus of a future farm colony. In this initial colony quiet, industrious male patients are employed with great benefit to themselves as well as financial profit to the hospital. These men cut ice and wood in winter, make maple syrup in the spring, and raise farm crops, eggs and poultry for the entire institution.
In the year 1888 a training school for nurses was established at the State Hospital by order of the trustees. This school has been in constant operation ever since. The training school has affiliated relations with one or two general hospitals as well as with the Concord District Nursing Association in Concord. In this way nurses receive instruction in surgery, in obstetric nursing and in general diseases.
In 1901 the Legislature changed the corporate title of the institution from New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane to New Hampshire State Hospital, thereby recognizing the true character of the institution as well as assuaging the feelings of the patients and their relatives.
In 1907 the new hospital building was opened for the reception of patients. It fulfills the double purpose of a psychopathic and admission hospital for new cases, as well as an infirmary for treatment of patients physically sick. The attempt is made in this building to treat insanity just as ordinary sickness is cared for in a general hospital. There is a resident physician and his assistant, and a pathologist; a well-appointed laboratory, diet kitchen, hydrotherapeutic room fully equipped with the most modern apparatus, dental department, and an operating room. Under the resident physician is the head nurse, who is also superintendent of the training school for nurses. Graduate women nurses are placed in charge of the men's wards in the hospital building, with assistant women nurses and orderlies, just as in a general hospital.
All new cases are admitted at the hospital building, are examined, charted, and assigned to their respective wards. As long as is necessary or possible they are detained in the reception wards. If their mental condition does not render continued residence in this location necessary or feasible, then they are transferred to the proper ward in the main building, or if convalescent, are assigned rooms in the Bancroft or Twitchell houses. Tubercular patients, when not too far advanced, are treated in beds on open verandas. There are also in addition to the large open wards four smaller wards with individual rooms so arranged with reference to bath rooms and lavatories that they can be completely isolated for the segregation of contagious disease. When patients in other parts of the institution become physically ill or . are not expected to live they can easily be transferred through the subway on a wheel carriage to the passenger elevator in the basement of the hospital building, and thence to their proper ward.
In the year 1910, additions were made to the building for disturbed and actively excited patients. These additions were of reinforced concrete construction, and as nearly fireproof as possible. Provisions for continuous baths were made in these additions.
The last detached building for patients—the Walker building, named in honor of J. B. Walker, for 60 years a member of the board—was opened in June, 1913. This latest structure, with a capacity for 212 patients, which can be doubled by the addition of one large wing, is a complete unit in itself, similar to the hospital building, having a central administrative portion with kitchen and congregate dining rooms. The Walker building is intended for quiet industrial patients of both sexes. The women are engaged in laundry work, sewing, rug making, basketry and various kinds of needle work. The men work on the farm, in the shops, kitchen and wherever they can make themselves useful. The benefits to patients living in detached houses are exemplified in the Walker building, situated as it is far from the other buildings, with abundance of sunlight, fresh air and with a pleasing outlook from its windows and verandas. A general air of contentment prevails; everyone is employed in some useful service, and well-cooked food is served from a model kitchen adjacent to a large, cheerful, sunny congregate dining room.
The erection of a large heat, light and power station made it possible to convert the old boiler house into a patient's industrial department. In this department various industries have been taken up, such as seating chairs, making slippers, brooms, brushes, mats, stockings, and printing. It is hoped that in the near future tailoring, shoemaking and basket making can be taken up. At the present time two industrial teachers are permanently employed, a man and a woman, who, under the direction of the physician, teach selected cases the particular work for which they seem adapted. In the women's department a large amount of the work is done on the wards, the industrial teacher going from ward to ward as may be necessary, and once a week having a class, of dementia praecox cases chiefly, in the entertainment hall.
In 1914 many women patients were employed in the garden picking vegetables. During the coming season a plot of ground is to be prepared and made ready for such women patients as can be induced to have a vegetable or flower garden. The contentment and general peace of mind that prevails where the interest of women patients is enlisted in useful work is very noticeable.
For one year the hospital has employed a field worker, who visits the different parts of the state studying the genealogical history, environmental conditions and everything pertaining to the causation of the particular attack in any individual case. It is proposed in the near future to combine field work and aftercare supervision with the hope that more definite statistical data may be procured regarding the causation of a particular attack and subsequent history of the case after discharge.[1]
Building construction continued through the 20th century as the hospital population continued to increase. In 1941 the Dolloff building was built to meet the growing need for a special facility for geriatric patients. The Thayer Building was also converted to such a facility as the population of geriatric patients grew dramatically in the late 1950's. Also in 1941 the Medical Surgical Building was constructed. Originally all medical care was provided at Thayer Building. New Hampshire State Hospital employed a staff of general practitioners to provide on-grounds medical care including surgical, routine health screening and dental services. There was no need send patients to area physicians, as specialists came to the facility to treat the patients. The Medical Surgical Building had three Surgical Rooms on the top floor as well as full autoclave capabilities to keep instruments sterile. The lower floors served as intensive care units or as recovery wards. The Dental suites were located in the basement, which also housed the pathology lab and physical therapy department. Routine X-rays and electrocardiograms were also provided on the first floor as part of the normal health screening process for all patients.
The Anna Philbrook Center, built in 1960, is named for Dr. Anna Philbrook who was instrumental in its creation Dr. Philbrook was one of the first women licensed to practice child psychiatry in this country and in 1933, the 63rd person to become a licensed psychiatrist in the US. She started her career as a staff Psychiatrist at New Hampshire Hospital. In 1945, she was named director of the State Child Guidance Clinics. This unit had two homes the home of Ambassador John Winant and the basement of Thayer Building before a new facility was built on Hospital grounds in 1959. Until 1969, the North Wing of the Child Guidance Center served as an outpatient treatment facility for emotionally disturbed children. In 1969 Dr. Philbrook's dream became a reality when the rest of the structure was completed as an inpatient unit and was named the Anna Philbrook Center.
The last building constructed was the APS building in 1989. When it first opened it was state of the art in psychiatric care for New Hampshire's adult and elderly populations. The architectural designs allowed more natural light to reach patient care areas to assist in the healing process. The mall type atmosphere as you entered gave it the look of openness and welcome to those who reside and visit. Though primarily an inpatient care facility, the Hospital hosts several outpatient support groups and programming to assist the public and families in recovering from mental illness.[2]

The site was built on 250 acres of land overlooking Lake Winnisquam and Lake Opechee. It housed people between the ages three and 21, but in 1905 it allowed women over 21. The school added a hospital, a farm, a dining hall, and a woman's dormitory by 1910. In 1916 overcrowding set in with 300 residents. The school's name changed in 1924 to the Laconia State School.
During the Great Depression, many families had fewer resources, so they sent their children to the school, where they would at least be fed. Every time the school faced problems, the Legislature refused to increase its budget. Requests for funds for repairs and expansion fell on deaf ears. In 1942, the school had 600 residents, who were served by staff working 51 hours a week, leaving one staff member to care for 30 to 35 residents. Time was increased for education and training, more steps towards individual privacy was made, a geriatrics unit was added, and there were introductions to co-educational activities.  In 1953, parents, with help from Hungerford, formed the New Hampshire Council for Retarded Children. However, after being viewed with hostility, in 1960, Hungerford was forced to resign.
The population continued to increase, with 1,000 residents, and a wait list of 400 in 1974. There was never enough staff to care for the residents. Parents decided to file a suit towards the state for failing at its own law, which stated ""the Division of Mental Health to establish, maintain, implement, and coordinate a comprehensive serviceable delivery system for developmentally disabled persons"". The reduction of 230 residents was ordered by the Garrity vs. Gallen ruling, but instead it was decided to slowly reduce the numbers until there were no residents left.
In 1991, the facility that was once Laconia State School became Lakes Region Facility, a state prison. But the plans to make the old school into a prison was challenged, as locals didn't want a prison in their town. In 1997, LRF became a permanent facility. The 300 cap was increased to 500 with the capability of expanding to 600 beds in the future. The buildings, many of them built in the 19th century, had been vacant and in disrepair. An inmate labor force was responsible for nearly all of the major renovations. Consequently upon completion, both male and female inmates would be housed at LRF to participate exclusively in substance abuse, educational, self-improvement and other programs.[1]
The prison closed in 2009. In 2019, NBBJ, a Boston consulting firm, presented a master plan for mixed use development of the property. The plan called for 345 housing units, including single-family, starter homes, townhouses and apartments. It also included recreational facilities, a boutique hotel and 32,500 square feet of retail, restaurant and office space. Since 2010, the state has spent more than $300,000 a year securing and maintaining the vacant property, an appropriation that is set to decrease to $232,000 in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.
Over the years some residents were buried in unmarked graves at random locations near the school before this cemetery was opened in 1941. As before, the burials were unmarked graves until the parents organized and asked that all the unmarked graves be identified. In 1976, marked gravestones, purchased by the parents, were laid over each of the graves.

New Hampshire,Sidis Psychotherapeutic Institute,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sidis_Psychotherapeutic_Institute,,,1910,Preserved,Single Building,,,"In 1910, Sidis opened a private asylum, the Sidis Psychotherapeutic Institute, on the Portsmouth, N.H., estate of a wealthy New Englander. Hoping for referrals from psychologically minded colleagues, he announced the opening of his hospital in the Psychological Bulletin and advertised it in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, which he had founded. The ad noted that he would treat patients by ""applying his special psychopathological and clinical methods of examination, observation and treatment.""
Sidis touted the luxury of the asylum's accommodations and setting, even more than the availability of psychotherapy. ""Beautiful grounds, private parks, rare trees, greenhouses, sun parlors, palatial rooms, luxuriously furnished private baths, private farm products,"" wrote Sidis in his brochure describing the institute. Moreover, he offered his patients the somatic treatments of hydrotherapy and electrical stimulation, as did his less psychologically minded colleagues. The emphasis on luxury combined with the availability of the popular somatic treatments, even in an institution created by an ""advanced"" thinker like Sidis, suggests that wealthy patients expected a traditional, medical approach to treatment.
As the Sidis Institute illustrates, life in the small, private asylums contrasted sharply with conditions in the late 19th-century public institutions. Patients at public hospitals were usually involuntarily committed, and they typically displayed violent or suicidal behavior before their hospitalization. The public hospitals were overcrowded and dirty, with bars on the windows. The staff was poorly paid and frequently treated patients harshly. Given these terrible conditions, well-to-do patients used their wealth to take shelter in a physician's home and escape the fate of the poor. Not surprisingly, the cost of a private hospitalization was steep. Sidis, for example, charged $50 to $100 and ""upwards"" a week ($50 would be equivalent to roughly $1,000 today). ""Bills are payable in advance,"" he informed his prospective patients.
For their money, patients received personal, attentive care. Fanny Farmer (1857–1915), the noted cookbook author, stressed the importance of pampering patients to improve their health. Speaking to the staff at one institution, Farmer recommended that patients be given individual custard servings, rather than ladling the custard from a large, common bowl because patients want to feel that they are ""being particularly looked out for.""",1923.0,"Portsmouth, N.H.",,,1910.0,,,,,0

New Hampshire,Carroll County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Carroll_County_Almshouse,,,"February 1, 1870",Demolished,Single Building Plan,,Carroll County Home | Mountain View Community | Carroll County Department of Corrections,"In 1869, the Carroll County Board of Commissioners purchased two 250 acre farms for the purpose of establishing the county’s almshouse and jail. The property was located a mile from the Ossippee train depot. The almshouse and jail opened on February 1, 1870.
The almshouse and jail were originally housed in the same building – a large wooden farmhouse, three stories in height above a basement, with a wing extending to the south and an ell attached to the wing. The building housed jail inmates, insane patients, and the poor – men, women, and children, as well as the superintendent and his family. The original almshouse had room for 52, while the jail consisted of only four cells.
A report from 1900 describes the living arrangements: “The superintendent’s rooms are in front, but open from the same corridor as the rooms of the paupers. The jail adjoins the main corridor downstairs, and the rooms for the insane are directly over it, opening from the main corridor upstairs. Men, women, and children, the insane and prisoners, are all together, nor can it be otherwise with the present building. The rooms for the insane are small, dark, and badly ventilated, but only a very few are confined all the time. At night the doors are locked only in the rooms for the insane, the jail, and the men’s dormitory in the attic.”
Unsurprisingly, the almshouse and jail were in poor condition. It wasn’t until 1885 did the almshouse receive one bathtub for the 55 “inmates,” as they were called. An 1885 report described the jail as, “wholly unfit for use, and is a disgrace to the county.” The jail, with its four cells, were extremely dark. A single window at the end of a narrow corridor provided light for the entire jail. They were cold and damp and poorly ventilated. The same report went on to say the jail was “in no respect are … fit for detention of any person.” Over the next four years, the jail received no improvements, and an 1889 report called it “the worst jail in the state” and noted its “utter unfitness for occupancy.”
By 1891, conditions did not improve much. Another bathtub was added to the almshouse, providing one each for the male and female population. Small 8x10 inch windows were added to each of the four jail cells, but reports still did not consider it a “decent place for the detention of criminals.” At this time, there were 60 inmates at the almshouse, including seven children, and two prisoners in the county jail.
1895 brought the almshouse and jail steam heating, doing away with the stove heating that posed a constant danger to a wooden building seriously ill-equipped to combat fire. At this time, there were 60 inmates, including six children and 15 insane patients. Still, the jail was “entirely unsuitable for its purposes” and it was strongly recommended that “the county should take early steps towards the erection of a decent jail.
The 20th century brought some much needed changes. A new three-story brick building was erected by 1911. The first floor housed an eight cell jail and two officer rooms. The women’s and children’s dormitories were on the two upper floors, which were connected to the main almshouse building by a covered passageway. They had their own separate dining and sitting rooms. The superintendent and his family, almshouse employees, and male inmates remained in the old almshouse building. Some of the male inmates remained in their attic rooms, while most of them lived on two floors in the ell wing.
The original almshouse and jail buildings, as well as the poor farm, remained as they were in the 1900s up until the mid-1970s. Slowly, the care of the almshouse became focused on its elderly population, and in 1973 its name was changed from the Carroll County Home to the Mountain View Nursing Home. The farm was now worked through prison labor, and the inmates were moved to a new facility on the same property.
Today, the Mountain View Community nursing home and the Carroll County Department of Corrections still sit on the same tract of land as its predecessors, though none of the original buildings exist.
Located a little over one and half miles from the almshouse property sits the Ossipee Pauper Cemetery. A graduate student at Vermont College stumbled across the cemetery and its rows of numbered markers and decided to honor the deceased by identifying each of the 298 graves. She was successful in identifying 268 of them. Though, as commonly practiced during this time, group burials likely occurred and the true numbers of those laid to rest in the pauper cemetery is unknown. The majority of the burials occurred between 1870 and 1930. The student started a campaign to raise a memorial. The inscription on the memorial plaque reads, “Carroll County Farm Cemetery c. 1870: Beyond the mournful numbers, lie no more grief or fear. No sad or sweet thoughts linger; for those who slumber here.”

New Hampshire,Grafton County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Grafton_County_Farm,,,1860s,Demolished,Single Building Plan,,Grafton County Almshouse and Insane Asylum | Grafton County Jail | Grafton County Farm | Grafton County Nursing Home | Grafton County Department of Corrections,"Sometime in the 1860s, an almshouse was established on 650 acres of farm land on a bluff overlooking meadows and the banks of the Connecticut River in North Haverhill, New Hampshire. A fire destroyed the original buildings and were rebuilt in the 1880s.
The almshouse was a two-story brick building with two wings that housed the female “inmates” in the east wing and male inmates in the west wing. There were about 40 sleeping rooms, each containing either two single beds or one double bed, and two converted sitting rooms that provided beds for 10 additional inmates.
The asylum building was connected to the west wing of the almshouse by a covered walkway. On average, the asylum housed 20-25 patients, both men and women. Some men were allowed to work on the farm, but, as noted in an 1898 report, “most of the women are totally irresponsible, and have to be confined constantly in their rooms. This asylum has an unusually large percentage of exceedingly bad cases.” By 1907, all insane patients were moved to the State Hospital at Concord.
The 650 acre farm yielded plentiful crops and included pastures for 100 cows, 15 horses, and 100-200 pigs and hogs. After the jail was built sometime in the late 1890s, much of the farm labor was provided by the inmates.
A 1898 report described the newly built jail building as brick and two-story, with two tiers of cells, one above the other. Each floor contained four steel-walled cells. Inside each cell were two swinging frames for cots, a washbowl set, and a water-closet. The jail was able to house 32 male inmates. However, other reports from the late 19th century note how female inmates were housed too closely to their male counterparts. Conditions at the jail were horrible. One report noted that ““The sanitary condition of this institution is the most abominable to be found in any institution of its kind – or for that matter, in any other – in the State. It would be difficult to devise a more filthy and disgusting arrangement than is here to be found.”
The Grafton County Farm, Nursing Home, and Department of Corrections currently sits on the grounds of the former almshouse, asylum, and jail buildings, though none of the original buildings still exist.
The farm is the only government-operated dairy farm in New England. Prisoners from the Grafton County Department of Corrections who are accepted into the farming program, work at the dairy barn, help with milking, or work in the calf barn for nine months before their release from the prison. Milk produced at the farm is sold to Cabot Cheese.

New Hampshire,Hillsborough County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hillsborough_County_Farm,1849.0,,,Closed,Cottage Plan,,"Poor's Farm, Goffstown | The Poor Farm at Wilton | Hillsborough County Farm at Grasmere | Hillsborough Poor Farm","In 1849, the townspeople of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire purchased farmland in Goffstown from a successful farmer named Noyes Poor. Poor’s Farm literally became the county’s poor farm, complete with an almshouse and a house of correction. Existing buildings on the farm were refit to house the county’s poor. Additional buildings were eventually erected to house the growing population at the poor farm, including a larger almshouse and insane asylum.
In 1853, a smallpox outbreak required there to be a “pesthouse” built to separate and care for the smallpox patients. The pesthouse was later used for other contagious diseases.
A fire broke out one morning in November 1866, destroying the almshouse and leaving 125 “inmates” without a place to live. Some of the inmates were moved to the jail and asylum, while others moved to various buildings in nearby Manchester.
It was decided that rather than rebuild the farm at Goffstown, it would be better to purchase another farm and its buildings to use as the county’s poor farm. In 1867, residents were moved to the Whiting Farm at nearby Wilton.
At the start, the county refit existing buildings for the purposes of housing the poor and those deemed “insane” before building nearly a dozen additional buildings including a reform school and a pesthouse. There was no hospital on the grounds. An 1885 report noted how a hospital was absolutely necessary as the current hospital room, which held 20 patients who were receiving treatment from infectious diseases such as Scarlet fever and measles, was being concurrently used as the ladies’ dining room.
The Hillsborough County Farm remained at this property for the next 26 years, and at its height, the farm was home to over 500 residents.
Due to some mishandling of sales accounts and the farm estate, the county again decided to move the poor farm back to Goffstown, this time to a farm called “Grasmere.” Construction on brand new brick buildings and wooden outbuildings began in 1894, and the Wilton property was abandoned a year later.
The Hillsborough County Farm at Grasmere opened its doors in 1895. The new property included a superintendent’s home and administration building, almshouse, house of correction, and insane asylum.
The administration building, situated at the front, is three-stories tall with a two-story ell. A parlor, sitting room, dining room, offices, kitchen and pantry were located on the ground floor. Fifteen sleeping rooms and other apartments were on the second and third floors. The cellar contained fruit and vegetable storage, a milk room, butter making department, boiler room, and a washroom for servants.
The new almshouse had room for 300 people. The basement contained an ironing room, dry house, smoking room, bathroom, bakery, and flour room. The female ward was located to the right of the main entrance. On the first floor was a reception room, eleven sleeping rooms, dormitories, sitting room, clothing room, and nursery. The second floor of the female ward had a sewing room, toilet room, additional dormitories, and a hospital room. The men’s ward was located to the left of the main entrance. The first floor was laid out similar to the female ward with a reception room, eleven sleeping rooms, and a dormitory, but also included a chapel and the almshouse kitchen and dining room. The second floor of the men’s ward included a school room, hospital room, dormitory, and rooms for officers.
The insane asylum was built to house 175 patients. The U-shaped building had a main corridor with a wing off of each side for the female ward (left) and male ward (right). The layout of each ward was similar: dining room, sleeping rooms, attendant’s rooms, and toilet rooms. The women’s ward included a serving room. Sleeping rooms for each department were located on the second floor. The basement of the asylum contained recreation rooms and bathrooms.
A two-story prison building, connected to the almshouse by an underground tunnel, had room for 80 men and 40 women. In the basement was a toilet room, smoking room, and stock room. The first floor had separate dining rooms for men and women, and two sleeping rooms for officers. The second floor contained separate sleeping rooms for males and females, three large rooms for each sex.
Outdoor space was used by those living in the almshouse and the asylum. Outbuildings on the property included stock and horse barns, a piggery, slaughterhouse, blacksmith shop, carpenter shop, meat room, outdoor refrigerator, and an undertaker’s room.
The population of the poor farm increased during the harsh New England winter months, housing up to 650 inmates. In the summer, that number decreased to around 400.
A cemetery was added to the property in 1896 with each graved marked with a numbered marble tablet, the numbers corresponding to records giving a short description of the illness and death of the deceased. Records for everyone who was born, lived, or died on the farm between 1894 and 1924 are kept at the Goffstown Historical Society. While many of the grave markers have been identified, nearly 710 men and women buried in the cemetery remain anonymous. The graveyard sits behind the almshouse building, across from the railroad.
It has been recorded through correspondence that unclaimed bodies of the deceased were sold to Dartmouth Medical School for use in anatomy classes, as allowed by law. The medical school paid $40 for each body, which included the cost of embalming and transporting the bodies to the school.
The county recognized the need for a separate hospital to care for the county’s poor, and in 1906 a new hospital was built across the street from the poor farm. The hospital was “very completely equipped for the care of the sick, having separate wards for men and women, physician’s office, rooms for nurses, an operating room, a maternity ward, and a well-arranged ward for tubercular patients.” The Hillsborough County Hospital was renamed the Moore General Hospital in 1953 and demolished in 1995.
Prisoners continued to be held at the Hillsborough House of Correction through the 1980s. Eventually, male prisoners were moved to another facility and in 1986 it was transformed into a medium security women’s prison.
The almshouse began to focus care on the county’s elderly population and became the Hillsborough County Nursing Home in the 1960s. In 1977, a new nursing home was built down the road from the county home and all patients were moved to the new facility.
It is unknown when exactly the insane asylum closed. It’s very possible that during the early 20th century, patients were slowly moved to the state hospital or other nearby mental health facilities.
The author of the History of the Town of Goffstown, published in 1922, reflects on the impact the Hillsborough County Poor Farm and its institutions had on the community:
“…how many thousands have been sheltered by the institution. What tales or sorrow could some of the unfortunates unfold. To some it has been an enforced retreat, to the far greater numbers a ‘haven of refuge.’ All classes, kinds and conditions have from time to time been cared for. The poor, the unfortunate, the sick, the insane and the idiotic have all found what many of them never knew before, a comfortable home, afforded them by the County of Hillsborough.”
The original administrative and almshouse buildings at Grasmere, along with a few outbuildings, still stand off of Mast Road in Goffstown. They currently house the Hillsborough County Complex and Goffstown Court. The jail and asylum buildings have since been demolished. The Hillsborough County Cemetery can be accessed from the Goffstown Rail Trail.
The Whiting Farm is a registered historic property and private home. The only remnants of the original poor farm are a single barn and stone foundations.

The buildings were located in North Boscawen, New Hampshire, on a hill overlooking the Merrimack River, with the asylum located across the road from the almshouse. The original almshouse building was destroyed in a fire sometime in the early 1870s, then rebuilt out of brick.
The almshouse was a two-story building, not including the basement or attic, with the male ""inmates"" occupying the northern end and the female inmates in the southern. The center of the building was reserved for the superintendent's uses. There were separate entrances for each section. The attic contained a large room known as the ""old ladies’ attic,"" containing ten beds for elderly female inmates.
The asylum was built in the 1860s, with a new wing adding 29 rooms in 1887. The newer asylum building had 41 rooms total. The old building contained 12 rooms that were reserved for ""the worst cases."" The female ward was on the first floor, while the male ward was on the second.
A 1900 report noted that ""The insane in this county, fifty in number, have better quarters than the average, and are cared for as well as possible under the county system. Some are necessarily kept in close confinement, but seemed comfortable and tidy.""
None of the original almshouse or asylum buildings exist today. The Merrimack County Nursing Home currently sits on the grounds of the former almshouse, while the Merrimack County Department of Corrections sits on the grounds of the old asylum.

The Campus is comprised of five interconnected buildings.
Mitchell Memorial Hospital was built in 1935 to serve as a general county hospital. The hospital was closed in 1944 when the war caused staff shortages. The Mitchell Building was reopened in 1952, and as a result of renovations in early 1992, the building is now home to Administrative and County Offices.
The Fernald Building was built in 1958, with 84 resident care units. In 1974, the Blaisdell Building was completed, providing Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Activities, along with 104 resident care units. In 1980, a portion of the Blaisdell Building became home to the Helen F. Wilson, Adult Medical Day Care Center. In December 2013, the day care program was closed.
December 1992 brought the opening of the John C. Driscoll Building and Elizabeth “Betty” Greene Atrium – a year-round enclosed courtyard, providing residents a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere for socializing. An extension to the Fernald building, completed in 1986, provided an expansion in laundry, kitchen, and housekeeping facilities, as well as a new staff dining room.
Today the Campus stands as a provider of superior comprehensive nursing and medical care that meets the physical, psychological, and social needs of all residents.

New Hampshire,Strafford County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Strafford_County_Farm,1867.0,,,Preserved,Pavilion Plan,"F.N. Footman (Almshouse), G. Brown (House of Correction)",,"Strafford County purchased two farms totaling 290 acres to establish the county’s almshouse, house of correction, and insane asylum. The poor farm included the main almshouse, blacksmith’s shop, carpenter shop, slaughterhouse, and other farm outbuildings. Those who were able to work did so on the farm and provided as much as 90% of the farm’s labor.
The Almshouse building was made of brick and three-stories, with a full basement and attic, in a U-shape floorplan, similar in design to the Merrimack County Almshouse. It was designed by F.N. Footman and built by Fall and Moulton. The almshouse was built to house 250-300 people. The main block housed the superintendent and administrative offices. Each wing housed the poor, separated by gender. Each wing included its own hospital room. The original construction included cells in the basement to contain inmates accused of misdemeanors.
In 1881, a fire broke out in the Almshouse as a result of an overheated furnace. Thirteen of the 169 inmates died, including two children who were living in the attic.
After the fire, a separate ward was eventually built to house children. A school room was then established in the main building.
The Almshouse’s appearance remained relatively untouched until 1964 when a new kitchen and dining room were built in the back, connecting the two wings. In 1970, a new nursing home was built in front of the original Almshouse building.
The Insane Asylum was a two-story wooden building, an attic, and a connecting two-story ell. The first floor housed the asylum keeper and his family, along with 17 inmates. The second floor house 29 inmates, and eight inmates in the attic. There was an outdoor area for the inmates, surrounded by a 10-12 foot wooden fence. Each window in the asylum was barred, and some had heavy wire screening. An 1889 report noted the building was “very cheaply and poorly constructed, and is not suitable for an insane asylum…The institution needs quite extensive repairing.”
On the night of February 9, 1893, the nightwatchman was making his 10pm rounds when he noticed a fire in one of the inmate’s rooms. It was believed the inmate had started the fire with a match, as they were readily available to inmates who smoked. The fire spread rapidly, and the nightwatchman only managed to save a few. Forty of the 44 inmates died and the building was left to burn.
As a result of the fire, a hearing with the State Board of Health to determine the cause and who would be held accountable for the loss of life and asylum building. County officials had been warned previously of the danger of fires and the necessity for proper fire prevention, but those warnings went unnoticed. The result of the investigation found that the “system for caring for the county insane was in the same in all counties, differing only in some minor details. The system was the outgrowth of a forced necessity, the guiding principle of which was to house, clothe, and feed the incurable insane at the smallest possible expense to the county. The result of this investigation had the effect on the next legislature to enact a law abolishing all of these county insane asylums, and the State assumed the entire support, control and management of the insane, and the county asylums were abolished.” It was decided that the county insane would no longer be housed at the county farms. Inmates deemed “incurable” would be moved to the State Hospital at Concord. The asylum building at Stafford County was never rebuilt.
In 1907, a separate House of Corrections was built after it was decided that the prison inmates should not be housed in the same building as the poor. The two-and-a-half story brick building was built behind the Almshouse. It was designed by G. Brown and built by Herman Lord. The Administrative portion is separated from the prisoner’s quarters by a heavy brick wall and steel door. . Leading from the dining room are a smoking room, barber shop, and lavatories. Bathroom with seven shower stalls. From the dining room extends a tunnel to the kitchen of the main almshouse through which the prisoners’ meals are sent. The prison cells consist of two tiers of double cells, 24 cells in a tier, thus accommodating 96 prisoners. Three tiers in original design. The tunnels were blocked off sometime in the 1940s.
The original Almshouse, House of Corrections, boiler room and its 60 foot smokestack, and laundry room are all preserved and on the National Register of Historic Places. The buildings are now used as a nursing home and county offices.

New Hampshire,Sullivan County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sullivan_County_Farm,1867.0,,,Demolished,Pre-1854 Plans,,Sullivan County Almshouse and Insane Asylum | Sullivan County Home,"The Sullivan County Poor Farm began in 1866 when the county purchased 365 acres and its farm buildings in Unity, New Hampshire. The county attempted to refit the existing farm buildings to house the poor and insane, and opened its doors in December 1867.
Reports throughout the early to mid-1880s from the State Board of Health noted that the insane were kept in “miserable pens in the second story of an old shed.” There were four “strong rooms” in the shed that kept the inmates constantly confined. There was no attendant with the specific duty of taking care of the insane and no nightwatchman.
By 1885, a proper building for the insane was erected. This two-story building provided 16 sleeping rooms, two ample sitting rooms, and two bathrooms for the insane. A partition ran through the middle of the building to separate the female ward from the male ward. A later report noted that the current insane were all females and kept constantly confined. There was still no attendant for the asylum, but the Almshouse matron and her daughter would occasionally check in on the patients.
In 1891, the State Board of Health reported on the female patients kept in the asylum. At this time, there were five female patients, three of which had the freedom to roam the building as they pleased while the other two were kept locked in their room. It was noted that those three patients were frightened of the other two. One of the two patients under constant lock and key had “been locked into a close room for years, with no bed, except a mattress and blankets put in at night; no furniture whatever, not even a chair; she wore a print dress not over clean, and went barefooted.” It wasn’t until the county farm hired a female attendant who wished to work in the asylum building and focus her care on the patients there that they began to notice a positive change in the appearance and manner of the patients. The patient now had a clean room that she kept tidy herself. She kept herself clean and neatly dressed. The “change was brought about in a few days by patience and kindness. This instance is given solely to show that even the incurable insane are capable of great improvement through proper influences, and it is a most forcible argument in favor of the better care of the indigent insane.” In the years following the 1891 report, it was favorably noted that “not a patient is under lock and key throughout the day. Some of the patients that were formerly kept locked up now have their liberty almost entirely unrestrained. This condition has been brought about by personal interest in the patients and a constant effort to better their condition, the success of which has been very marked.”
The almshouse was a four-story wooden building. The kitchen and shared dining room were located on the first floor, towards the back of the home. The women’s sleeping rooms were located on the second and third floors in the west half of the building, while the men’s sleeping rooms were located on the second, third, and fourth floors of the east half. It wasn’t until 1910 that the Almshouse was fitted with electricity. Not only did the almshouse not have electricity until 1910, there was no modern plumbing or sewage, no hospital rooms, no assembly room or chapel, no sitting rooms for the women, and no sewing room.
By 1910, the insane who required special care and restraint were moved to the State Hospital at Concord. The building was then used as a house of corrections.
Over the years, additional land surrounding the existing poor farm was purchased to expand the property. In 1931, a new almshouse was built to provide care for those suffering during the Great Depression, and the name was changed to the Sullivan County Home. In 1963, a new hospital was erected on the site. Today, the Sullivan County Nursing Home provides care for the county’s elderly and those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The Sullivan County Department of Corrections has a facility on the ground aimed at rehabilitation and recovery. All that is left of the original buildings is the stonewall that runs along the county road leading to the nursing home and jail.
A small cemetery is located across the road from the current nursing home.

New Hampshire,Coös County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Co%C3%B6s_County_Farm,1866.0,,,Demolished,Single Building,,Coös County Almshouse | Coös County Aslyum | Coös County House of Correction | Coös County Nursing Hospital,"In November 1866, Coös County purchased the Isiah Pickard farm on the banks of the Connecticut River to establish the county’s poor farm, using the existing farmhouse buildings to house the poor, insane, prisoners. In 1867, a three-story addition to the original farmhouse was completed to create the Almshouse, with the capacity for 100-120 people.
The poor farm sat on 575 acres, land that provided work and food for the inmates. The Superintendent’s residence, Almshouse, and the building used for the insane were connected and form a long row of wooden buildings. Various barns, carriage houses, and agricultural outbuildings scattered the farmland.
The Almshouse eventually grew to four-stories, with the east half being occupied by women and west by men. There were separate dining rooms for each sex, and a large women’s sitting room, which was also used as an assembly room for religious meetings. There was also a school room for children, though reports state that any orphans were eventually transferred to the Orphan’s Home at Franklin.
The county’s insane were kept in a separate building, west of the Almshouse. The building was one-story, long, “old and wholly unfit for the confinement of the insane,” said a report in 1889. The ward contained 14 small rooms or cells, some of which are only 5 ft x 8 ft and 9 ft high. “The county should provide better quarters, especially for the better class of its insane. These rooms are suitable, perhaps, for the confinement of some of the worst patients that come to an institution of this character, but they do not possess the conditions necessary to health or comfort.” A later report in 1891 stated, “The old building in which the violent insane have been confined for several years, still remains in practically the same condition as heretofore. It is an entirely worthless building.” Finally, in 1899 a new building was erected for the county’s insane. There were 24 rooms on the first and second floors and four additional rooms in an attic that “might be used in case of necessity.” The building was connected to the Almshouse by a covered walkway.
In 1901, a report noted the poor farm was severely understaffed and struggling to provide care for its 77 inmates. Two assistants helped the Superintendent, one was to look after the prisoners while the other looked after the farm. There was one nightwatchman. A matron and her two female assistants were responsible for the female population on the farm. In the insane department, one of the female patients who was “subject to periodical attacks of acute mania but perfectly sane in the intervals” had charge of the other female patients. It was noted that in the men’s insane building, one male patient “who is at times very dangerous, sometimes taking an axe and threatening every one, while at other times he is perfectly harmless…should be closely watched all the time in a way that is almost impossible to manage in a county institution.”
By 1911, all of the insane patients had been transferred to the State Hospital at Concord, and the building formerly used for the insane now housed the male poor. The House of Corrections, a one story building and completely separate from the main Almshouse buildings, kept male prisoners in its eight cells. Female prisoners were kept in the Almshouse.
In 1930, new hospital was built. The first and second floors were used as a residential facility for the poor and the top floor provided a 35-bed general hospital.
By the 1970s, the hospital operation was phased out and the County converted the building into an 82-bed intermediate care facility. The 1930s hospital building is still used and is now known as Coös County Nursing Hospital. Next door is the Coös County Department of Corrections. None of the original wooden buildings stand today.

New Hampshire,Cheshire County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cheshire_County_Farm,1866.0,,,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"The Cheshire County Poor Farm was established in 1866 on the banks of the Connecticut River in Westmoreland, New Hampshire on 300 acres. The Almshouse was built in 1867 out of brick, and was intendent to house both the poor and criminals. The Superintendent’s House, of wood, was built directly next to the Almshouse.
As described in an 1889 report, the first floor of the Almshouse, or Main House, housed the kitchen and separate dining and sitting rooms for the male and female inmates. The second story housed female inmates in two large sleeping rooms, one with eight beds and six in the other. In the third story, on the female side, are the chapel and several sleeping rooms. On the opposite side were the men’s sleeping rooms. On the fourth floor are eleven sleeping rooms, originally designed for prisoners, but since the construction of a county jail at Keene, they have been used mostly for sleeping rooms by the inmates. Attic rooms were reserved for prisoners.
In the same report, it was noted that “very few insane inmates, incurable cases” were housed in the second story of the ell of the Main House. This addition included six rooms, about 8 feet x 10 feet, with one “good-sized” window protected by an iron screen. Some insane patients lived in the laundry house, a small, one story wooden structure that sat behind the Main House. In the 1889 report, “a partially demented man suffering with some form of chronic disease” was found living in a corner room in the laundry building – “This was a bad and offensive case, but the quarters in which he was located seemed scarcely suitable, notwithstanding the circumstances of the case.” It was recommended that a separate building for the incurable insane be built, along with a new laundry house.
In 1891, the new laundry house was built, which also continued to provide additional rooms for the insane. There were three rooms on the first floor for the insane. On the second floor there were six rooms, and was connected to the Main House by a covered walkway. It was still reported that there was not adequate housing for the county’s insane.
By 1897, two insane buildings were constructed, one for males and the other for females. At this time, there were only seven male insane patients, all seven of them were “constantly confined.” There were 19 female insane patients. The female building was considered a “model of its kind” with 28 rooms, 12 on each floor and four additional rooms in the attic for the “worst cases.” The attic also housed the asylum’s chapel.
By 1901, a jail had been erected on the poor farm property. The Building for Insane Females was considered far superior than the Building for the Insane Men. It was reported that “the worst cases of the feeble-minded [men] are kept out of doors in summer, where they have air and sunlight, while yet under restraint.”
Like with the other county insane asylums at the turn of the century, insane patients slowly began to be transferred to the State Hospital at Concord for care. In 1911, there were only three male insane patients, noted as being the “most demented,” left at the Cheshire County farm.  However, it seems that female patients continued to be housed at the farm. The 1911 report notes that females who were “not very excitable” were kept on the first and second floors of the insane building, “while those who are violent are provided with rooms especially fitted for them on the third floor.” As the population of insane males declined, “helpless invalids” were moved into the male insane building on the first floor. The second floor contained prisoners sent to the county farm. A small building was also erected in the early 1900s to care for tuberculosis patients.
With a new and far more adequate prison established in Keene, the Cheshire County Farm focused its care on the poor and infirm. Over the years, the original buildings were demolished and a more modern county hospital and nursing home were built. Those buildings were ordered to close in 1954 due to inadequate care and supervision.
Today, a nursing home and assisted living facility sit on the site of the former almshouse and insane buildings. The farm still produces crops as well as dairy, which still provides food for the nursing home and the new House of Corrections in Marlborough.
The first cemetery for the Cheshire County Farm was established in 1867 on Old Ferry Road. A monument was erected in 1873. Below the simple obelisk is a simple plaque that reads “Known but to God.” The exact number of burials is unknown due to lost records.
Cemetery #2, which was south of the barns, was established sometime after 1910. Graves were marked with iron pins, topped with an oval disk on which was inscribed a number. Record of the corresponding names have been lost. These pins have been pulled up and the cemetery is now overgrown.

New Hampshire,Belknap County Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Belknap_County_Farm,,,,Demolished,Pre-1854 Plans,,"<be> | Belknap County Almshouse, House of Corrections, and Insane Aslyum | Belknap County Nursing Home | Belknap County Department of Corrections","The Belknap County Poor Farm was established in 1872 on 250 acres in Laconia. The Almshouse, jail, barns and necessary agricultural outbuildings were all built of wood. The farm would provide work for the able-bodied poor and prisoners.
The two-story almshouse provided shelter for the county’s poor as well as the superintendent and his family. A poorly built, two-story stone jail stood next door to the almshouse. The first floor housed prisoners, while those deemed “insane” lived on the second floor in cells or “strong rooms.” There were no living spaces or sitting rooms provided for the insane. All of the county’s insane population at this time were sent from the State Hospital at Concord.
By 1884, reports from the State Board of Health repeatedly called for proper housing for both prisoners and the insane. The jail was considered a “disgrace to civilization” as it had no ventilation, was overcrowded, and offered no separation of the sexes. Both prisoners and the insane were denied proper meals, clean water, and fresh air.
Two years later a new jail house was built on the county poor farm. This new brick structure was reinforced with railroad iron that would prevent anyone from escaping by breaking through the brick walls. The jail included 16 cells. At this time, an addition was put onto the Almshouse, providing two jail cells for female prisoners, two hospital rooms, and a large room to be used as a chapel and schoolroom. The new jail was connected to the almshouse by a covered walkway.
An 1889 report from the State Board of Health noted that there was still no separate ward for the county’s insane. The insane were allowed to mingle with the other inmates, “with the exception of one or two cases which are kept in confinement.” It had been suggested, again, that separate rooms or a separate wing be provided for the insane and that the “county at once provide better quarters for the detention of the violent insane.” The solution was to house the “demented insane” in three rooms in the attic of the almshouse. Again, the State Board of Health asked the county commissioners to erect a separate building for the insane. Their 1892 report noted “these [attic] rooms are not suitable for any class of the insane.”
By 1894, the insane were moved to an existing building on the poor farm that housed the laundry. They were forced to live in ten rooms fitted into the attic.
It seems that at some point between the 1894 report and a 1907 report stating that the insane had been moved to the State Hospital, a separate two-story brick building was erected to house the insane. There were eight rooms on the first floor, along with a separate bath and toilet rooms. The second floor also contained eight rooms.
The Almshouse in the early 1900s, however, was adequately designed to house and care for the county’s poor. Another wing had been added by this time. The east wing was for male inmates, while the west wing housed female inmates. On the first floor of the almshouse was the Superintendent’s sitting room, dining room, reception room, and office. Behind the Superintendent’s rooms was the female dining room. The Superintendent and his family lived on the second floor of the main building. On the first floor of the west wing was the male dining room, a few sleeping rooms, and a large smoking room. A piazza was added along the length of the wing. The majority of male inmates slept on the second floor. The female wing was laid out similarly. The kitchen, boiler room, and laundry were located in the basement. The building formerly used to house the insane now held prisoners in the basement, with the upper floors providing ample hospital rooms for the infirm.
By the 1960’s, the county began selling off parcels of the county farm. A more modern nursing facility and jail were built. While the original almshouse building no longer stands, parts of the 1890s brick jail are still in use by the current house of corrections.
A small county cemetery, called Primrose Cemetery, is located nearby the current Belknap County Nursing Home. The dates on the tombstones range from 1875-1891. The headstones are numbered, but little is known about who is buried at each plot.

New Hampshire,Glencliff State Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Glencliff_State_Sanatorium,1901.0,,1909,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Glencliff Home for the Elderly,"In New Hampshire, the state legislature authorized construction of a sanatorium in 1901, a year when the state's annual death rate from tuberculosis hit 194 per 100,000 and tuberculosis was the most common cause of death for persons aged 20 to 40. Had tuberculin skin testing been available at the time, virtually every adult would have tested positive—an indication of either latent infection or active disease.
This is in stark contrast to the current situation in New Hampshire. Today, the annual incidence of tuberculosis is 1.6 per 100,000, and fewer than 10% of DMS students have positive tuberculin skin tests (and most of those who do are foreign-born students from countries where tuberculosis is still common). Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center admits only between one and four patients a year with active tuberculosis, and most of them recover after six months of treatment. Dartmouth medical students and residents are more likely to see patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic inflammatory disease, than with tuberculosis.
The New Hampshire State Sanatorium was located at Glencliff because the site's elevation of 1,650 feet would provide the fresh mountain air that was then thought to be therapeutic for tuberculosis patients. Construction on the facility was completed in the summer of 1909, and the first patient was admitted on September 14 of that year. Dr. John M. Gile, a professor of clinical surgery and later the dean of Dartmouth Medical School, was the first consulting surgeon at the sanatorium, and Dr. Elmer Carleton, also a member of the DMS faculty, was the consulting laryngologist. Most patients came from the major industrial centers in southern New Hampshire, such as Manchester, Concord, and Nashua, but any resident of the state identified as having active tuberculosis would be considered for admission.
Admission required that the patient first be seen by a designated practitioner in Claremont, Dover, Keene, or Manchester or at the sanatorium itself. These physicians were asked to consider whether the applicant presented ""a reasonable prospect of improvement or cure"" before they referred the patient to the superintendent of Glencliff for admission. Patients with an unfavorable prognosis were usually turned down, though sometimes they would be accepted if it was thought that small children in the patient's home were at risk of infection.
In general, Glencliff did not accept children, although the cutoff for adulthood at the time was 14 years. So-called ""pre-tuberculous"" and tuberculous children were treated at another New Hampshire facility, the Pembroke Sanatorium, beginning in the early 1920s.
Glencliff's patients came from all social classes and all professions and included doctors, hospital superintendents, factory workers, steamfitters, and junk dealers. For many patients, their stay lasted years, sometimes even decades. A Chinese exchange student at Dartmouth stayed for two years. One patient remained at the sanatorium for 23 years.
In the early 1900s, Glencliff was a self-sufficient community, designed to maintain the isolation that was part of the sanatorium concept. Its medical facilities included a hospital unit, an open ward, an x-ray facility, an operating room, and a microbiology laboratory. The campus encompassed 500 acres and included a farm with pigs and cows and a vast vegetable garden. The institution made its own maple syrup, pasteurized its own milk, and sent summer vegetables to be canned at the New Hampshire State Hospital in Concord. Electricity, water, and sewage disposal were all provided by the nearby town of Glencliff. Coal was brought to the base of the mountain by train until the railroad was discontinued in 1952. The sanatorium even had its own shortwave radio station.
By 1932, more invasive surgical procedures were being used to treat tuberculosis at Glencliff, specifically extrapleural thoracoplasty. This procedure involved the removal of several ribs to bring the chest wall down to the lung and thereby collapse the tuberculous cavity. Patients were instructed to lie on a pillow to push the chest wall against the lung after the ribs had been removed. At least one Glencliff patient subjected to this treatment says that this procedure was very painful and sometimes led to temporary addiction to opiates. Thoracoplasty was observed to reduce the one-year mortality of cavitary tuberculosis from 80% to between 14% and 27%.
Many of the surgical collapse procedures were performed in the single operating room at Glencliff and were done by physicians from Dartmouth, as well as by two surgeons who traveled up periodically from Boston. Dr. Dawson Tyson from Dartmouth performed phrenic nerve resections, thoracoplasties, and extrapleural pneumonolyses during his involvement with the statewide program for the surgical treatment of tuberculosis in the early 1940s. During this time, Glencliff also used Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital's pathology and autopsy services, as well as consulting with other specialists from Dartmouth.
Beginning in 1936, intramuscular gold injections were also tried briefly, but were soon discontinued due to the treatment's toxicity and the dif- ficulty of obtaining this German preparation during World War II.
During the pre-antibiotic era at Glencliff, death was a common outcome for patients with chest x-rays that showed the distinct cavities indicative of far advanced disease. The annual reports filed by the institution include statistics on admissions, disease classifications, and deaths—from which it can be calculated that overall mortality rates during the period from 1909 to 1944 ranged from 5% to 22%. An average of 20 patients a year had far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, and the mortality rate in that group ranged most years between 25% and 45%. And the death rate remained high among patients with far advanced disease even after the introduction of lung-collapse therapy. But the outlook for patients with tuberculosis changed dramatically after the 1944 discovery of streptomycin, the 1946 discovery of paraaminosalicylic acid (PAS), and especially the 1952 introduction of isoniazid.
By 1970, other potent new drugs, including rifampin, were also available. That year, Glencliff sent its last active tuberculosis patient to Mary Hitchcock Hospital, ending the sanatorium movement in New Hampshire. The once-flourishing U.S. network of 420 sanatoriums was soon virtually abandoned. Many of the hospitals were eventually converted to other uses, though some were left empty for fear of contagion. In 1970, the Glencliff Sanatorium was converted into the Glencliff Home for the Elderly. Through the efforts of Sandra Knapp, Glenclifff's administrator from 1979 through 2002, and the current administrator, Todd Bickford, many of the unique architectural features of the original facility have been preserved. The main patient building still has its floor-to-ceiling windows that admit ample light and the sturdy columns that used to support the screened porches which were used for the open-air treatments (these spaces have now been framed in, however, to create additional patient rooms).

New Hampshire,Pembroke Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pembroke_Sanatorium,1902.0,,1904,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Pembroke Sanatorium for Consumptives,"The Pembroke Sanatorium Company held its first meeting in January of 1902. It was founded by three local men who established a group for the treatment of tuberculosis patients. The President of the group was Dr. O. B. Douglas, the secretary and Officer in Charge was Dr. H. T. Fontaine, and the treasurer was Ernest Fontaine. Several years later, the group founded the sanatorium, which opened its doors in 1904. The weekly charge for treatment was $15 when the facility first opened.
According to the 1904 edition of the ""Journal of Outdoor Life,"" the sanatorium sat on 34 acres of pine woodland which was ""especially favorable to the cure of tuberculosis."" The property contained several wooden structures, built with the intention of maximizing patient's exposure to fresh air. The main building contained a ""large reception room, dining room in connection with a spacious kitchen, a sun room, offices, and facilities for hydro-therapy."" Patients' sleeping quarters were arranged to face the south, increasing sunlight exposure. The buildings were heated by steam, and bathrooms contained modern plumbing with running water. Many of the buildings had electric lights.
The institution also featured an ""abundant supply of pure water from a large well, drilled out of solid rock and furnishing a practically inexhaustible supply."" Water was pumped by an engine and was directed to modern hydrants in case of fire.
Around the main building, several wooden ""camps"" were erected for an ""open-air life."" The camps, made out of pine has fronts that were entirely open to the air and sunshine. Each contained a bed and a wood stove for use during the winters.
The facility boasted round the clock care by an on site physician who prescribed ""diets, rest, exercise, baths, and medicines."" [1]",,"Pembroke, NH",,,1904.0,,,,,1
