North Carolina,Black Mountain Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Black_Mountain_Developmental_Center,,,1977,Active,Single Building,,Black Mountain Neuro-Medical Treatment Center,"The Black Mountain Developmental Center began as an offshoot of the J. Iverson Riddle Developmental Center in 1977 and became an autonomous facility in 1982. Six years later Black Mountain was funded as a treatment and care facility for patients with severe Alzheimer's disease, which is sometimes accompanied by violent behavior. A program to assist the aged with special medical needs was instituted in 2004.

North Carolina,Broughton Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Broughton_Hospital,1875,1875.0,1883,Active,Kirkbride Plan,Samuel Sloan,Western North Carolina Insane Asylum | State Hospital at Morganton,"In 1850, Dorothea Dix persuaded the General Assembly to appropriate money for a state-run psychiatric hospital in Raleigh. By 1875, an estimated 700 North Carolinians were classified as “insane” and not receiving proper care. One hospital thus proved insufficient to meet the needs of the State’s mentally ill. Therefore, on March 20, 1875, the General Assembly voted to provide $75,000 to establish a second state hospital. Four western North Carolina cities, Statesville, Hickory, Asheville, and Morganton, competed to become the home for the institution that was to be known in its early years as the Western North Carolina Insane Asylum. Morganton was selected.
Gifts and purchases resulted in 263 acres being acquired by the State in 1875. Work began almost immediately. As an economy measure, 50 convicts were released from penitentiaries and brought to Morganton to help make bricks for the hospital’s first building. The brick contractor was responsible for the feeding, safekeeping, and return of the convicts. Realizing that the building under construction would not provide adequate space and due to insufficient funding to expand its size, the General Assembly appropriated an additional $60,000 in 1877 for another wing. Five years later, in December 1882, the Avery Building and its south wing were completed. Dr. Patrick Livingston Murphy was hired as the first superintendent, a position in which he served for 25 years.
In early 1883, the General Assembly directed that Dorothea Dix Hospital and the Western North Carolina Insane Asylum determine between themselves which of the State’s counties each hospital was to serve. On March 7, 1883, a line was drawn following the western boundary of Rockingham, Guilford, Randolph, Montgomery, and Richmond counties.
On March 29, 1883, the first patient was admitted to the Morganton facility. Shortly thereafter, approximately 100 patients were transferred by rail from the crowded hospital in Raleigh. During the first two years of operation, 252 patients were received. In his first biennial report in 1884, Dr. Murphy said, “There are some insane persons in our district who ought to be in the asylum but cannot be cared for.” The General Assembly heard his plea for more space and authorized the money to finish a north wing for the Avery Building to provide space for 150 additional patients. This wing opened in 1886. In that same year, the eastern boundary of the Western District was extended to Durham, Chatham, Moore, and Richmond counties. In 1887 the Scroggs Building was opened.
The name of the hospital was changed from the Western North Carolina Insane Asylum to the State Hospital at Morganton in 1890. This name was retained until 1959, when it was changed to Broughton Hospital after then Governor J. Melville Broughton.
During the early years of the hospital’s existence, many of the male patients worked on the hospital’s roads and grounds. A road was built to the hospital from the town of Morganton with the help of Broughton Hospital patients. Additional land was purchased, and by 1893 the total campus acreage was up to 331.
By May 1899, the eastern dividing line for the Western District was changed to the western border of Granville, Durham, Chatham, Harnett, Cumberland, and Robeson counties. Additional buildings, including an airing court, a summer house for women, a bowling alley and billiard room, a bake house and dairy, a greenhouse, and a new stable and farm house were added to the campus. Yet additional land was purchased in 1900 at the Hunting Creek Bridge, and a golf course, which was used by patients and staff, was built near the Farm Colony.
In the early 1900’s, the colony treatment approach was adopted, which resulted in the establishment of a number of detached residential units where patients could live in smaller groups in less of an institutional atmosphere. The colony houses were constructed to resemble other farmhouses in western North Carolina. Gardens, vineyards, and orchards surrounded these homes, as actual farming operations were undertaken to keep the custodial-care patients productively occupied. There were three colony groups involving ten buildings, which housed about 350 patients.
Influenza and pneumonia hit the hospital in 1901. At that time, the hospital served 52 counties in North Carolina. In 1903 the Harper Building opened, and in 1906 a large, new laundry was constructed. An amusement hall was also planned in front of the Scroggs Building at the strawberry patch, which is now the location of the Geropsychiatry parking lot and Watkin’s Garden. By 1908, buildings to house female tuberculosis patients and the Nurses’ Home were completed. The subsequent year, a new kitchen and bakeshop followed, along with a building to house male tuberculosis patients. In 1910, plumbing was replaced in the Avery Building, iron beds replaced wooden beds, and granite steps in the front of Avery Building were replaced with marble steps.
Meanwhile, a state-level hospital commission was formed to inspect and supervise the hospitals. As far as treatment planning, there were daily staff meetings at the hospital where each patient’s case was presented and reviewed.
After the end of World War I (1918), public attitudes toward the State’s mental patients seemed to change. The mental health hospitals were forgotten by the Legislature and by the public. The performance of management was frequently measured by the amount of unexpended appropriations that could be reverted to the State Treasury. The cost of maintaining a patient in the institution at that time was less than $150 per year. The colony system was gradually phased out in the 1920’s. Nonetheless, additional buildings and physical plant improvements continued to be constructed: a receiving ward for men, a dorm for men, a staff apartment building, a central power plant, a cold storage plant, and an elevator for the Avery Building.
Staffing figures from that era indicated there was one physician to 355 patients and one attendant to 13 patients. Nurses were on duty 15 hours per day including Sundays, with one afternoon off each week from 2-6 PM and one evening off from 7-10 PM. Unit attendants slept on the wards with patients and received one Sunday off per month. During the period from 1932-1934, there was one physician to 500 patients and one nurse to 21 patients. The fifth floor of the Avery Building was designated for attendants while the third and fourth floors were available for patients. The basements were also fitted for units, giving over 500 more beds to the hospital. During the 1940’s, the hospital census grew to approximately 3600 patients.
During the next two decades, numerous buildings were added to the campus. In addition, new therapies such as occupational therapy, industrial therapy, and recreation therapy were made available to the patients. Affiliations were developed with medical and nursing schools. In 1963 the Community Mental Health Act was passed and President John F. Kennedy called for the creation of 2,000 community mental health centers, which were to be within the geographic and economic reach of all citizens.
In 1965 the State was divided into four regions, each containing a mental hospital. These regions were divided into geographic groupings of counties called catchment areas. At that time, Broughton Hospital’s responsibilities included eight catchment areas comprised of 32 counties. That same year, the hospital was reorganized and the unit system went into effect. Initially, there were seven units. During the latter part of 1966, the first worship service was held in the new Chapel.
In 1968, after the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the school program began on the fourth floor of the Avery Building. At that time, school-aged patients were housed in geographic units, and the only time they were grouped together was when they attended class.
Throughout the early 1970’s, many changes took place at the hospital: the Physical Therapy Department was established; electroconvulsive therapy was started; Industrial Therapy began using a token system instead of giving snuff as payment to the patients; the Outpatient Clinic closed; Western Piedmont Community College and Gardner-Webb College began nursing affiliations with the Hospital; EEG equipment was purchased and the X-Ray Department added Nuclear Medicine; the new Vocational Rehabilitation Facility was completed and the local Foothills Area Program opened; Lithium was introduced to patients; the old amusement hall became the sheltered workshop; group therapy was first used on all units; patients began to wear their own clothing; the Neuroscience Department was created; patients’ rights policies were established; and the basement of the Chapel was completed. The Chapel basement became the site for a courtroom where patients’ hearings were held on a weekly basis. Such District Court civil hearings for involuntarily committed patients began in June 1974.
During 1972, more than in any other previous year, concern was expressed because adolescents, geriatric patients, and patients with alcoholic abuse problems were housed on geographic units. A proposal was drawn up for further division of the unit system. The rights of alcohol abusing patients also became an issue when the ruling was made that they could not be jailed for “public drunkenness” but must be allowed to go home or to a treatment center. Along with the issues of housing adolescents and the ESEA, the problem of recreation for the youth was an issue. Plans were made for a youth center in the basement of the Nurses Home, and the Youth Activities Program (YAP) opened. Also, a unit for the deaf was established in March 1974 to provide special care for the deaf, mentally ill population.
On March 28, 1973, Broughton Hospital received its first survey by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), and the hospital received a one-year accreditation. The latter part of 1973 brought another reorganization of the hospital. The Youth Unit and other specialty units were created. The Geropsychiatry Unit opened with the first patient admitted in October 1974. By 1975, the organizational structure of the treatment units appeared as follows: Units A, B, C, & D (Acute Adult Psychiatric Geographic Admissions); Unit E (Medical/Surgical); Unit F (Alcohol & Drugs); Unit G (Nursing/Geriatrics); Unit I (Intermediate Care); Unit J (Youth); Unit K (Geropsychiatry); Unit L (Eldercare - OBS); Unit M (Deaf); Unit O (High Management); Unit P (Community Placement); and Unit R (Habilitation - Mental Retardation).
During the latter part of the 1970’s, the Department of Health and Human Services implemented CARELINE, the Staff Development Department was created, construction began on the recreation shelter, OSHA training was given to all employees, and the Employee Assistance Program was established. Hospital expenses for inpatient stay increased, and by 1980 the daily costs were $62 (psychiatric), $65 (ICF), $74 (ICF/MR), and $141 (Medical/Surgical).
The 1980’s also brought many changes for Broughton Hospital. Surveys by outside accrediting bodies increased, hospital expenses continued to rise, new street signs were placed throughout the campus, the fitness trail was completed, the buildings on campus that were not named when constructed were given names, employee picnics and music festivals for patients became annual events, the Quick Response Safety Team was formed, the first service award banquet was held, ET (electronic transmitting) was designed to signal for emergency assistance, Greystone House was converted into a hospital museum and meeting/conference center, a literacy program for patients was established through VISTA, the Opportunity Center opened, and the first public exhibit of patients’ art was held at the Jailhouse Gallery.
The 1990’s brought budget crises, gas crunches, recycling efforts, and parking regulations. The Broughton Hospital Foundation was formed in December 1992 for the purpose of enhancing the lives of the clients at Broughton Hospital through donations, endowments, activities, etc.
In January 1998 the Twin Oaks Nursing Facility received a grant to provide a more homelike environment for its patients. This was the beginning of the Eden Alternative Program at Broughton hospital. A year later, the Twin Oaks Nursing Facility/Broughton Hospital became the only psychiatric hospital in the United States or Canada to hold the distinction of being accepted into the Eden Alternative’s Registry of Care Facilities. In recognition of its entry into the registry, Twin Oaks was presented with a plaque, called the Eden Tree, by the City of Morganton. In the context of a state-level thrust toward placing patients from state hospital based nursing facilities into community-based residential settings, in April 2002 the Twin Oaks Nursing Facility officially closed it doors.
The hospital is currently organized by function and program service, and at the level of units is comprised of four residential divisions with patients grouped by major treatment modalities, age, and patient need. The four divisions are Division A (Adult Admissions), Division M (Medical), Division P (Psychiatric Rehabilitation), and Division S (Specialty Services).
In May 2006 a new service opened its doors. Deaf Services (part of the Speciality Services Division) at Broughton Hospital is comprised of 14 beds for persons who are 18 and over who are deaf, with mental illness and/or substance abuse issues. This population is comprised of acute and longer stay patients who reflect various diagnostics groups.
Today, Broughton Hospital is the largest of the three psychiatric hospitals operated by the State of North Carolina within the Department of Health and Human Services under the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services. The Hospital serves the 37 westernmost counties in the State, which have a population of over three million, or about 36.4% of the State’s total population. Services are rendered through direct admission to the hospital or through local managing entities (LME’s) in the hospital’s catchment area that provide outpatient services. Patients are admitted to the hospital by judicial commitment or on a voluntary basis. Today the hospital serves approximately 4000 patients per year with an average cost per day of $583. It employs approximately 1200 employees and has a 98 million-dollar annual operating budget.[1]

Burials in this cemetery date back to the 1800's. There are more than 300 graves in the cemetery, marked by tags with the patient's initials and patient number. The hospital fire chief was Kelley Houk, a minister who also did embalming. Visitors are generally escorted to the cemetery. For information call 828-433-2111.
New information as of 1 Jan 2013:  Burials in this cemetery date back to May 1883 when the first woman was buried here.  The last burial was in 2012 and the last prior to that in 1997 and prior to that in 1953 when the practice of burying here was ended with the two exceptions noted above.  There are a few more than 1580 men, women and stillborn children buried here.  A complete listing can be found under Broughton Hospital cemetery on FindaGrave.com. (see http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=2183934&CScn=broughton+hospital&)
Other current online listings are in error as they duplicate erroneous records including dates of birth, dates of death and misspelled names.  The cemetery remains open to the public and no escort is required.  Each grave is marked by a ground level marker bearing the patient number, abbreviated (and in some cases misspelled) name, year of birth (often erroneous but based on what was thought to be correct at time of admission and/or time of death) and year of death.  These markers were placed during a joint project between the then Chaplain and an Eagle scout with funds donated as part of the project and with the assistance of Sossoman Funeral Home. A few of these markers have been removed due to mower damage and plans are in place to repair and reset them in 2013.
Many of the graves are also marked by stones erected by family, many of them soon after death and a steadily increasing number erected recently by descendants or other relatives.  A few of the graves still have the brass tags hanging.  These are the original markers and were suspended on chains strung along each row.  These brass tags were stamped with a partial patient number and the person's initials. (source: Suzannah McCuen, MD)

North Carolina,Butner State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Butner_State_Hospital,,1941.0,1947,Closed,Cottage Plan,,John Umstead Hospital | Central Regional Hospital Butner Campus | Veteran's Life Center (Current),"During 1942 through 1945, Camp Butner’s primary mission was to train combat troops for deployment and redeployment to the European and Pacific theaters. The Camp contained rifle ranges, artillery ranges, a prisoner of war compound, and barracks and support services for approximately 40,000 troops.
Camp Butner was officially closed by the War Department on January 31, 1947. On April 26, 1947, the War Assets Administration assumed responsibility for the acreage. As the Camp was phased out, over 20,000 acres were sold back to the farmers who had original ownership. Approximately 5,000 acres were transferred to the North Carolina National Guard which maintains it for training. In addition, over 13,000 acres were transferred to the State of North Carolina in 1947. On November 3, 1947, the State of North Carolina took over the Camp and assumed the police and fire services. Also at this time, Mr. John Umstead, brother of Governor William B. Umstead, initiated a move in the North Carolina Legislature to provide better care for the mentally ill. This was the beginning of what is now known as “Butner,” which quickly became the home of a number of State facilities.
The abandoned army hospital became the site for John Umstead Hospital. The hospital serves the 16 counties of the North Central Region. Its primary function is to provide an inpatient facility to diagnose and treat individuals (6 years and older) with psychiatric disorders, restore them to an optimal level of functioning, and return them to the community.
1947 was also the year that the State Legislature designated the State Board of Mental Health as the governing body of the Town of Butner. The Board was given the power to prepare, adopt and enforce ordinances and regulations for the development of both the State and privately owned property in the area. In 1973, following State government reorganization, the Department of Human Resources (currently the Department of Health and Human Services) was given this responsibility. Also during 1973, the Butner Municipal Committee was appointed to advise the Secretary of Human Resources in governing the Town. The responsibility of managing the Town was assigned to the business manager of John Umstead Hospital.
In the past, the Department of Health and Human Services employed a full-time Town Manager for Butner. The Butner Planning Council, comprised of seven Butner residents, had formal powers in the adoption and administration of land use ordinances, and represented an informal advisory role with respect to other municipal services and powers.
The hospital serves 14 counties in north central North Carolina. It has 321 beds. It is scheduled to close in 2008. It will merge with Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh, which is also scheduled to close in 2008 – creating the Central Regional Psychiatric Hospital.",2010,,,,1947,2008,321,,,0
North Carolina,Cherry Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cherry_Hospital,1877,1878.0,1880,Active,Cottage Plan,,Asylum for Colored Insane | Eastern North Carolina Insane Asylum | Eastern Hospital | State Hospital at Goldsboro,"In 1877, the North Carolina General Assembly appointed a committee to recommend the selection of a site for a facility for the black mentally ill which would serve the entire state. On April 11, 1878, one hundred seventy-one acres of land two miles west of Goldsboro were purchased. The site was described by Governor Z. B. Vance as ideal for a hospital building because of good elevation in a high state of cultivation and central location for the black population.
On August 1, 1880, the first patient was admitted to the then named ""Asylum for Colored Insane"". Since that time, there have been several name changes including: The Eastern North Carolina Insane Asylum, Eastern Hospital, and State Hospital at Goldsboro. The name was changed to Cherry Hospital in 1959 in honor of Governor Gregg Cherry.
The bed capacity for the hospital when established was seventy-six but over one hundred patients were crowded into the facility by Christmas of 1880.  These patients were being cared for through a $16,000 appropriation.  On March 5, 1881, the Easthern North Carolina Insane Asylum was incorporated and a board of nine directors appointed.  The Board of Directors sought more appropriations for treatment of the black mentally ill.  A separate building was established for treating tubercular patients.  In addition, a building for the criminally insane was opened in 1924.
The early treatment program was mainly custodial; however, early reports indicated that thirty-four percent were ""cured"" and released within the first six months of hospitalization. Chapel facilities and chaplain services were not available until the early 1950's but selected patients were allowed to visit churches in Goldsboro under supervision of an attendant. An occupation therapist was employed in 1932 but therapy was mainly confined to the farm, laundry, kitchen and yard work. Today a wide range of occupational and recreational therapies are provided.
Tranquilizing medications were widely used by 1955 and helped revolutionize patient treatment. As a result of extensive use of psychotropic drugs, the rate of discharges began to increase and the length of hospitalization decreased. While discharges increased, the admission rate also increased significantly and the resident population remained virtually stable at approximately 3,000 patients between 1950 and 1965. The highest rate of occupancy was approximately 3,500 patients. During its first 100 years of service, Cherry Hospital served 91,045 patients.
The budget for the hospital has grown from $16,000 in 1880, to over $64 million for Fiscal Year 2001-2002.  There are currently 1,243 positions providing a wide range of patient care and programs as well as administrative support.
For the first eighty-five years of its history, Cherry Hospital served the entire black population for the State of North Carolina.  In 1965, the hospital joined other state hospitals in implementing the Civil Rights Act.  Cherry began serving patients from the thirty-three counties in the Eastern Region in 1965 by providing services for all races.  Black patients at Cherry were transferred to hospitals in their appropriate region while Cherry received white patients from other hospitals in other regions.
A major milestone was reached in 1973 when Cherry Hospital was accredited for the first time by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. There have been subsequent surveys by this accrediting agency with each survey resulting in continued accreditation.
As Cherry Hospital enters the Twenty-first Century, we are keenly aware that treatment of the mentally ill is not a static process.  The dynamic process of effectively helping the mentally ill requires a diligent and dedicated search for appropriate modes of treatment.  Cherry Hospital is totally committed to the search of excellence in serving the mentally ill as reflected in our mission statement--""The mission of Cherry Hospital is to provide quality inpatient psychiatric services for the Citizens of Eastern North Carolina.""[1]
In late 2016 a new hospital facility opened to replace the original outdated hospital. The new hospital provides expanded services and additional capacity encompassed in one building. Amenities include a modern laboratory, dental and radiology departments and equipment, internal and external courtyards, a treatment mall (known as the ""Hope and Wellness Center"") decorated with flexible pictures hung magnetically, gymnasium and exercise room, library equipped with computers, cosmetology and barber shops, and anti-ligature doors/hinges/hooks and tempered glass.

There are reportedly at least three burial areas on the campus of the hospital.  It is estimated that there are well over 3000 people buried on the grounds.  Only some 700 or so graves are marked with upright brass crosses bearing patient name and dates.  There is no known extant listing of all those buried here.  However, an extensive listing of all those thought to have been buried on the hospital grounds since about 1913 may be found on Find a Grave.

North Carolina,Dorothea Dix Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dorothea_Dix_Hospital,1848,1850.0,1856,Closed,Pre-1854 Plan,Alexander T. Davis,Insane Hospital of North Carolina | Dix Hill | The State Hospital at Raleigh,"In the autumn of 1848 when Dorothea Lynde Dix came to North Carolina, attitudes toward mental illness in this state, like the scanty facilities, remained generally quite primitive. Nevertheless, the North Carolina Legislature was not unaware of the concept of a state hospital for the mentally ill. Earlier in 1825 a resolution had been passed requesting information needed to plan for the establishment of a ""lunatic asylum"". Nothing came of it then, and again in 1838-1839 action stirred in this regard with no concrete results. In 1844, Governor Morehead strongly recommended that the state build institutions for the unfortunate insane, blind and deaf; but the issue died without positive action. So things stood still in the fall of 1848 with Delaware and North Carolina remaining the two states of the original thirteen which had no state institution for the mentally ill.
Dorothea toured North Carolina. The conditions for the mentally ill that she found in 36 North Carolina counties were much the same as in other states, ranging from extremely poor to above average, with a census of about a thousand mentally ill in jails, poorhouses and private homes. She returned to Raleigh and compiled the information she had gathered into a ""memorial"" which she hoped to present to the legislature.
The report submitted to the legislature was a county-by-county report on her findings. She emphasized the need to remove the insane from jails for their own benefit and that of other inmates. Dorothea had a practical approach as well as an idealistic one. She listed costs in other states and economies that had been achieved. She recommended ""moderate employment, moderate exercise"" among the approaches to the treatment of the mentally ill, along with specifics of buildings and equipment.
As 1848 drew to its closing days, Dorothea Dix faced an economy-minded legislature primarily interested in railroads and, of course, politics. Her proposals were at first met with little enthusiasm but her memorial was a powerfully written and emotional appeal. Through persistent effort she found a sponsor for it in the person of John W. Ellis of Rowan County. He presented it to the legislature and proposed that a committee of seven from each house make a study of the memorial and report back to the legislature. A bill was written and reached the floor of the assembly on December 21, 1848.
The bill spelled out the needs and requirements for a state institution for the mentally ill and requested $100,000 — a huge sum in those days — to finance the project. Opposition overcame attempts to develop a satisfactory means of raising funds for the hospital, despite the enthusiastic support by several individuals and the Raleigh newspaper. Yet at this point, chance and the results of Dorothea's kindness and concern for others brought success for the measure.
Staying at the Mansion House Hotel in Raleigh, Dorothea learned of a woman lying critically ill in one of its rooms. She went at once and set about nursing and comforting her. The sick woman, unknown to Dorothea at the time, was the wife of James C. Dobbin of Fayetteville, an influential member of the legislature. Dorothea spent all the time possible with Mrs. Dobbin. When she died on December 18th, Dorothea traveled to Fayetteville for the funeral. Deeply appreciative for Dorothea's kindness, Mrs. Dobbin-just before her death-asked her husband to support the ""asylum"" bill. Hearing of the defeat of the measure to raise money for the project, Mr. Dobbin hurried back to Raleigh from his wife's funeral and made a stirring plea for reconsideration of the bill, developing a workable compromise for raising the funds required. The bill passed the House in late December and the Senate, December 30, 1848.
This act provided for only $7,000 with later appropriations to be made later and for the appointment of six commissioners to select a site and oversee the erection of the hospital. These commissioners were John M. Morehead of Guildford County, Calvin Graves of Caswell County, Thomas W. Cameron of Cumberland County, George W. Mordecai and Charles L. Hinton of Wake County, and Josiah O. Watson of Johnston County. Dr. Edmund Strudwick of Hillsborough was chosen as the first ""Physician and Superintendent"" and placed in charge of construction. He served temporally since he was not experienced in the care of the ""insane"". Dr. Edward Fisher in 1853 was appointed Superintendent.
Overjoyed at the success of the plan, Dorothea offered to stay on to help in the selection of a site for the new hospital and to assist in many other ways. In 1851, the first commissioners of the ""Insane Hospital of North Carolina"" reported to the legislature: ""They selected a site for the said building and after carefully examining the whole country in the vicinity of Raleigh, they chose a location west of the city and about one mile distant, on a hill near Rocky Branch to provide a water supply. This location has a commanding view of the city and is believed to be perfectly healthy."" The Insane Hospital was located outside of Raleigh in pleasant surrounding countryside. It was thought that insanity was caused by social conditions and patients should be removed from family, friends and community. They purchased the 182 acres from Maria Hunter Hall and Sylvester Smith for $1,944.63. Both tracts of land were originally part of the plantation owned by Col. Theophilus Hunter in the late 1700's.
Dorothea Dix had refused to let the projected hospital be named after her, as many felt it should be. She agreed to have the site named ""Dix Hill"" after her grandfather, Doctor Elijah Dix. Since then the hospital has been known in the Raleigh area as ""Dix Hill"". Dorothea sent bibles, prayer books and pictures for the patients after the asylum opened. In 1870 she sent the asylum, at the request of the Board, an oil portrait of herself. Today the portrait is still housed on hospital property.
The first appropriations of $17,000 for the site were made for the new institution in 1849. Bond issues in 1851 and 1855 raised $100,000 and $80,000, respectively, in for the construction costs. Construction of the first building began in May, 1850 - a structure with a large central section and two wings, ultimately to have accommodations for 274 patients. Alexander T. Davis of New York City designed the Romanesque building. The two million bricks in the asylum were made only two miles away. The asylum was heated by steam and lighted by gas manufactured from coal or rosin. Two extra buildings were added. One building was for the steam boiler and gas manufacturing which was combined with a laundry. The second building was a kitchen and bakery with apartments for the staff on the second floor. There were apartments for the medical staff on the second floor of the main building. This was the first public building in Raleigh to be heated by steam heat and lighted by gas. The hospital's first unit was completed with rooms for 40 patients. On February 22, 1856, the first patient was admitted suffering from ""suicidal mania"". In the first nine months, fifty-one males and thirty-nine females were admitted.
It was believed that a ""moral treatment"" such as fixed schedules, development of routine habits, calm and pleasant surroundings, proper diet, some medications, physical and mental activities carried out in a kindly manner with a minimum of physical restraints would cure the patients. Ornamental gardens and landscaped grounds with walks were developed. A hospital farm was established to provide food for patients and staff.
Vocational work options were available to the patients. Females participated in making baskets, clothing, rugs, artificial flowers, and linens. Male patients made mattresses and brooms as well as assisted on carpentry projects. Some patients cleaned wards, worked on the farm, or in the kitchen and sewing room. Recreational activities included tennis, croquet, reading, dances, and concerts given by local choirs. In 1858 a wooden chapel was built. The four ministers from Raleigh took turns leading services weekly for the patients. Editors of the state newspapers furnished their papers to the hospital.
A cemetery was located on the asylum grounds. Marble posts with a chain along the line of graves were built. A tag contained the name of each person over his or her grave with the death of date. The hospital carpenter made the coffins.
In 1853 Doctor Edward C. Fisher of Virginia, a physician with experience and training in the care of the mentally ill, guided the hospital through its initial period of development and throughout the War Between the States. Even during the war years every effort, in the face of obvious difficulties, was made to keep the asylum functioning effectively. At the beginning of the Civil War there were 193 patients. In the spring of 1865 the Union Army occupied Raleigh. That April, by order of the Union Provost Marshall, the first black patient, a Union soldier, was admitted to the asylum. Also by order of the Provose Marshall the first black resident (a female) of Raleigh was admitted. The Union Army camped all over Raleigh and on the asylum grounds. They tore down fences and burned them for firewood, as well as confiscating grain and livestock for food. During the occupation General William T. Sherman toured the asylum.
Following the Civil War, admissions continued to mount with the growth of confidence in the asylum and the public's understanding of mental illness as a disease. Additional diagnoses were added to the asylum admissions such as those persons with mental retardation. In the 1870's mentally ill criminals were transferred from Central Prison to the asylum.
In 1870 the U.S. Census reported 779 insane in North Carolina and only 242 as patients at asylum. Due to overcrowding, the legislature approved funds to build other state hospitals. In 1880 an asylum for the ""colored insane"" in the state opened in Goldsboro. An asylum for the ""white insane"" living in the western half of the state opened three years later at Morganton.
The death of Miss Dorothea Lynde Dix in 1887 was strongly felt by the staff of the asylum. In the Superintendent's report, Eugene Grissom wrote the following passage. ""For more than a half of a century she stood in the vanguard of humanity, working valiantly and unceasingly for the stricken insane. Difficulty never stopped her, distance never wearied her, opposition never daunted her, refusal never subdued her, pleasure never tempted her, ease never lured her, and fame never attracted her. Her objects were the wretch insane – her field was the world – her thought the relief of the suffering – her success was their redemption, and her crown shall be the gift of Him like whom she ""went about doing good"". Earth bids farewell to this great spirit, who has given, if possible new beauty to the name of woman, and new splendor to the deeds of charity.""
In the 1890's state hospitals were admitting alcoholics, drug users and epileptics as patients. In an effort to reduce the increasing number of patients, the legislature mandated the transfer of the insane criminals back to the central penitentiaries in the 1890's.
The Insane Law of 1899 changed the name of the asylum to ""The State Hospital at Raleigh"", and revised the code for admission of the mentally ill to hospitals. For the first time there was ""voluntary"" admission. In the early 1900's citizen pressure forced the NC Legislature to increase capacity at all state hospitals. An epileptic colony was established to the rear of the hospital on 1,155 acres of land, known as the Spring Hill Farm and the Oregon Farm. It was purchased by the state from Mrs. Elizabeth Grimes. She was the widow of William Grimes, a wealthy plantation owner from Eastern North Carolina. By 1911 a training school for the retarded in Kinston, NC removed these patients from the hospital.
Before 1898, doctors and attendants cared for the patients as part of their ""on the job training."" All staff lived on the hospital grounds. That year, Dr. George L. Kirby, Superintendent of the State Hospital of Raleigh, employed the first graduate nurse to teach student nurses and attendants. The Dorothea Dix School of Nursing opened in 1902 with eight female students. It continued until October 1913 when the school was reorganized and arrangements were made for the students to receive the second year of their education at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. The male school did not succeed because the salaries were too low to induce males to continue their work and study for the three-year training period. The first class graduated in June 1915. The school was incorporated in 1916. Anderson Hall was built to accommodate the school offices, classrooms and living quarters for student nurses in 1918. Specialists in other areas of treatment soon followed including dentist, social workers and staff to teach vocations and crafts to patients.
In the early 1900's the hospital installed an ice and refrigerator plant. This enabled the staff to slaughter their own meat giving the patients good quality beef at a reduced cost. They also installed a sausage factory. Water coolers were placed in the wards.
In 1912 a field was selected for a vineyard and 1,850 grape vines were planted. The hospital superintendent stated in his report ""This should and doubtless will, yield an abundance of luscious fruit for the entire population and besides enough to make a sufficient quantity of the very purest and best wine for our old and feeble patients, and food flavoring for the sick."" Two years later the hospital purchased a used $15,000 greenhouse from the Westbrook Sanitarium in Richmond, Virginia for $500.
During World War I building projects were put on hold. In 1918 a flu epidemic took the lives of 18 patients and 2 staff. A total of 317 patients and staff were ill in one month.
Dancing and music had become an important form of entertainment by this time. Patients, nurses and male attendants assembled twice a week to enjoy dancing. Dancing lessons were given to the nurses and male attendants and they gave them to the patients. The hospital superintendent stated in his report ""All of them thoroughly enjoy the music, the effect is so apparent that music should be credited as one of the most potential remedies for the insane."" In 1924 a moving picture machine was added to the patient Amusement Hall. And was later replaced by a ""talking"" movie machine. Movies were loaned for free by local merchants. Annual BBQ's, tennis courts and a ballpark all added to the patient lives.
In 1922 Raleigh medical doctors and surgeons provided their services to the patients and staff. Two years later a building was erected for this purpose. By 1925 the census grew to 1,600. A department for white alcoholics was developed. The ""insane convicts"" were transferred back to the hospital into a new building erected for this purpose. The legislature had passed an act that patients of this type should be cared for in this institution instead of the state's prison. Due to the large number of patients, the new building was immediately too small and beds were placed in the hallways.
In 1926 a spectacular fire destroyed the main building and nine wards. The origin of the fire was believed to be a blowtorch used in soldering tin by workmen who were repairing the roof. Over 400 patients were quickly moved outside. The NC National Guard from Raleigh assisted staff with patients and maintaining order. Students from State College also offered their assistance with the patients. There was no loss of life. All Raleigh firefighting equipment was on hand to battle the fire. Durham Fire Department also sent personnel. Low water pressure prevented the firemen from extinguishing the fire quickly. Later the damaged buildings were repaired.
By the 1930's there were over 2,000 patients. New buildings were erected financed by the Public Works Administration. In 1936 the Dorothea Dix School of Nursing was operating according to the standards set by the NC Board of Nursing. Students received the second year of their education at the General Hospital of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. The Richmond college required that all students must have their tonsils removed before arriving at their institution. That same year the Dorothea Dix School of Nursing began to offer a three-month affiliation in psychiatric nursing for senior students in approved nursing schools.
During World War II the Dorothea Dix School of Nursing became a member of the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps, increasing student enrollment by sixty percent. The Corps recruited students in approved nursing schools to ease the nursing shortage. Funds received by the school from the Corps purchased needed equipment and books with the creation of a reference library. An annex was added to Anderson Hall to provide additional housing for student nurses. In the forties the student nurses traveled to Morisania Hospital in New York City for their second year of education. The number of student nurses decreased so much that by the third year the nursing education program was discontinued with the last class graduating in 1949.
The report of a study commission appointed by Governor Eringhaus resulted in hydrotherapy, shock therapy, and recreational facilities being added to hospital services. As a consequence of this study, a unified Board of Control for all state hospitals and schools was established. Citizen pressure resulted in the State Mental Health Act of 1945. This provided for a State Superintendent of Mental Hygiene. It also revised terms describing patients from ""insane or lunatic"" to ""mentally disordered"" and from ""idiot or feebleminded"" to ""mentally defective"".
By 1946 all the mental hospitals were so crowded that the legislature appropriated funds to purchase U.S. Army Camp Butner. It opened in 1947 as the fourth state hospital with 750 patients.
The Hill Burton Act of the U.S. Congress in 1946 made funds available to the states for hospital construction. In 1953 a state bond issue made possible the erection of three new buildings at the State Hospital at Raleigh including a chapel with renovations and additions to existing buildings. At this time the original main portion of the hospital was torn down and replaced. The two original wings remain. Now the hospital had over 4,000 inpatients and outpatients under its care.
The Second World War made the public aware of the numbers of men rejected for service because of mental illness. Necessity for returning soldiers with mental illness to active service speeded up treatment procedures. In 1946 the U.S. Congress passed the National Mental Health Act providing for grants for research in the cause and treatment of mental illness and for personnel training. These grants resulted in improved therapy so that many patients could be released sooner. Studies had shown that long term placement in large institutions did not help them get well. Furthermore, with the new drug therapy, many patients were released and follow-up care in the communities where they lived was needed. Many patients were discharged over the next twenty years.
In 1949 first year medical students were given summer jobs in the occupational and recreational therapy departments. This enabled the students to learn more about the patients and provide additional services to the patients. Recreational activities included music, radio, shuffleboard, square dancing, basketball, badminton, croquet, miniature golf, baseball, bingo and movies. A local Latin high school played several football games on hospital property, which provided additional entertainment for the patients.
By 1951 the state hospitals at Raleigh and at Butner had begun residency programs for doctors. Although the nursing school closed in 1949, nursing students from programs in the area continued to receive psychiatric experience at the Raleigh Hospital.
To help remove the stigma for discharged patients of having been at a state hospital, an act was passed in 1959 by the North Carolina Legislature to change the names of the state hospitals. The name of the State Hospital at Raleigh was changed to the Dorothea Dix Hospital to honor Dorothea Lynde Dix.
In 1962 the Federal Community Mental Health Centers Act provided funding for follow-up services for released patients in their own communities. The next year the NC Legislature created the development of community mental health centers and a central mental health department to administer mental health care statewide. In 1970 thanks to the development of many mental health centers, the census at Dorothea Dix Hospital dropped to 2,200.
As a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requiring designation of public facilities, Dorothea Dix Hospital no longer served the eastern counties of North Carolina for the white and Indian mentally ill. They now accepted the mentally ill of ""all races"" in 22 counties in South Central North Carolina.
In 1973 a complete revision of the mental health code was enacted by the legislature. The code revised several times since provided for patients' rights. This resulted in changes in physical facilities to provide more patient privacy and also in the treatment of patients. The type of hospital admission included voluntary commitment by which a patient could be released on his own written notice. Involuntary commitment patients, by the court, have the right to a hearing in a District Court under specific conditions to determine if that patient could be released from the hospital. The code also provided that patients have a right to treatment, to privacy, and the right to be treated with dignity. A bill of rights is posted in each state hospital. In order to insure the patients of their rights, a patient advocate is provided.
In 1974 the hospital had 2,354 acres of land which included three lakes and 1,300 acres for the farm. There were 282 hospital buildings equipped to handle 2,756 patients.
Dorothea Dix Hospital is now situated on a beautiful 425 acre tract of land, accentuated by oak and pecan trees, on the south side of the City of Raleigh. There are more than 120 separate buildings on the site, many of which were constructed during 1910-1930 and 1960-1980. The buildings are used for patient care, offices, shops, warehouses and other activities in support of the hospital. There are a number of buildings assigned as administrative offices for the Department of Human Resources and for the NC Farmer's Market. The hospital has the capacity to accommodate 682 patients. Declining census in recent years has dropped to an average of 350-400. To serve the 3,000 plus patients yearly, the hospital employees a staff of 1,300 to cover the range of services necessary to operate a modern psychiatric hospital seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. The current annual operating budget of more than $60,000,000 derives from appropriations authorized by the North Carolina General Assembly, from patient care receipts and from federal grants.
Other institutions-regional, county-based and local are now are an integral part of the state-wide program for mental health, currently functioning under the Division of Mental Health Services of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources. The original geographical area of responsibility has been reduced from all of North Carolina to that being the psychiatric hospital for the seventeen-county of South Central Region, under the general supervision of a regional director and the direction of the hospital director. In its Division of Forensic Services, Dorothea Dix Hospital continues to serve the whole state in dealing with questions and problems raised in the courts relative to mental illness. It also provides neurological, medical and surgical services for cases that are referred to it by other mental health institutions in parts of the state. Professional and technical training and clinical psychiatric research are major factors in the hospital's mission and a continuing effort is made to keep the ratio of staff to patients at a level to insure effective treatment and care.
In his 1874 hospital report, Superintendent Eugene Grissom wrote: ""It was discovered that the insane were not beasts and demons, but men whom disease had left disarmed and wounded in the struggle of life and whom, not often, some good Samaritan might lift up, and pour in oil and wine, and set anew on their journey rejoicing.
By 2015 the city council voted to demolish the some of the buildings and turn it into a park. The master plan includes refurbishing the original main building.

Dorothea Dix Hospital Cemetery is located on approximately three acres and contains over 900 graves. The cemetery was established soon after the founding of the hospital and was in constant use until the early 1970's. This cemetery served as the final resting place for the many impoverished patients who were laid to rest on the grounds of the facility which treated them.
Marble posts with a chain along the line of graves were erected. A tag contained the name of each person over his or her grave with the date of death. In 1859 the first body was laid to rest and in 1970 the last patient was buried here. The hospital carpenter made the coffins until the late 1945. Afterwards they were purchased locally. A hospital business manager, purchased coffins for $50.00 each, averaging 50 per year. Aluminum plaques were also purchased to mark the graves.
A grant was provided by the United States Small Business Administration to plant a border of trees around the cemetery. This tree border was built to obscure the view that had been left by an abandoned landfill. For nearly a century, only a cross and a stamped number marked most graves. Thus, hiding the family name from the shame of their sickness. In an effort to treat those resting in the cemetery with the respect and dignity they deserve, the hospital has creating a dignified final resting place for those who have died poor, unwanted and forgotten.
The Dorothea Dix Cemetery is frozen in time. Several times a year the hospital receives written requests or personal visits from individuals across the country seeking their roots. The transcription of 754 burials is taken from the 1991 survey produced by Faye McArthur of the Dorothea Dix Community Relations Department. Many thanks are owed to Faye McArthur for her dedication and cooperation in providing this list. 754 of the 958 graves were identified. New markers were installed with the name of the patient and the date of death.

North Carolina,North Carolina Hospital for Dangerous Insane,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=North_Carolina_Hospital_for_Dangerous_Insane,August 1901,,,Demolished,Single Building,Levi Scofield,,"Established by the state in 1901 and was located on the grounds of the state penitentiary in Raleigh.
The State Hospital for the Dangerous Insane was established in 1901 and located within the existing  State Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, and served the entire state. Prior to the establishment of the hospital, the criminally insane patients had been placed under the care of the staff of the State Hospital at Raleigh, which was located across the street from the prison, and housed in one of the penitentiary buildings. Now that the care of the criminally insane was the full responsibility of the state prison, a skilled physician was hired to be in charge of the ward and would serve a four-year term before a new physician was appointed.
The criminally insane were housed in the west wing of the prison, in a four-story building that had been separated from the rest of the prison and opened as a separate institution in August of 1901. On the first floor was a ward for African-American males, the kitchen, dining room, and store rooms. The second floor served as the ward for white males and provided office space for the hospital steward. The third floor was entirely reserved for white males. The fourth floor housed two wards separated by partition: one side for white females and the other for African American females. A female attendant also lived on the fourth floor in her own apartment. There were eight “strong rooms” or isolation rooms for unruly patients and those who attempted escape.  Meals were served to female patients in their ward. White male patients had their meals in the dining hall, while a portion of the kitchen was reserved for Black male patients.
The population as of April 1901 was 33, nearly all of whom had been inmates at the State Hospital in Raleigh or the State Prison. The majority of patients were guilty of serious crimes. A report from 1916 noted, “Practically all of them were hopelessly insane and in bad physical health by reason of long confinement or constitutional disease.” The majority of the patients came from rural districts in North Carolina and many of them farmers or laborers.
The population in the criminally insane ward steadily grew over the first ten years of it opening and soon became overcrowded. The prison was not receiving adequate funding to provide the care for the criminally insane. In 1907, the annual report of the prison stated that a new facility for the criminally insane was “urgently needed.” At the time, many insane patients were held in cells with the general population of the prison due to overcrowding in their own ward. A 1918 report noted that “the wards in which these people are confined are improvised, unsafe, and totally unsuited for such purpose.” Despite having a physician assigned to the ward, proper medical care and treatment often times was not given to all of the patients.
It soon became obvious that many of the inmates assigned to the criminally insane ward were not, in fact, dangerous, but born with mental deficiencies or were epileptic.  A 1918 report stated that of the 67 inmates, some could “neither speak coherently nor feed themselves.” The report when on to describe the imprisonment of three children under the age of 15 “who are absolutely devoid of all reason and have been since birth.” While they were accused of legitimate crimes, two including assault with a deadly weapon, the prison board recognized that this was not the place for them. “There are many other similar cases,” the report said. “The majority of the patients give very little trouble to the management.”
In 1923, an Act of the General Assembly was passed that closed the State Hospital for the Dangerous Insane at the State Prison and instructed the prison to transfer patients to other state hospitals. White inmates were transferred to the State Hospital at Raleigh (Dix Hill), while Black inmates were transferred to the State Hospital at Goldsboro. Each ward was able to accommodate 150 patients. This was to ensure the patients received adequate care in a facility designed for that purpose and to relieve overcrowding at the prison.

North Carolina,Caswell Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Caswell_Developmental_Center,1911,1912.0,1914,Active,Cottage Plan,,North Carolina School for Feeble-Minded | Caswell Training School | Caswell Center,"Caswell Developmental Center has been serving people with mental retardation since it was established in 1911. It is the state’s oldest residential facility of its kind. What is now an over 300-acre campus with more than 100 buildings was the brainchild of LaGrange native, Dr. Ira May Hardy, in a paper he presented to the Seaboard Medical Society. Dr. Hardy had a child with mental retardation in his own family, according to early Caswell papers, and he realized the need for a school for the “feebleminded”. His vigorous lobbying, with the support of the medical community, moved the North Carolina General Assembly to authorize the school on March 4, 1911.
The cornerstone of the first building was laid on May 6, 1912. That building still stands in the center of campus. It has served as an administration building and classroom area. Currently, it houses part of the Communication Services and Dietary Departments. It was named in honor of Dr. Hardy, who served as the first superintendent of the North Carolina School for the Feebleminded.
A new superintendent, Dr. C. Banks McNairy of Lenoir, was at the helm on July 1, 1914 when 15 young women became the first admissions. Those first residents lived in a farm house (now called the Stroud House) standing on the 807 acres Kinston and Lenoir County offered state officials to use for the school. In less than a year, the school had 120 residents, 65 of them boys. Most of those first residents were able to help with housework or worked on the farm. The residents of the school were fed with the corn, potatoes, and other vegetables the school grew and the pigs and chickens it raised. The first young residents were given two and one-half hours of schooling each day, followed by “manual and industrial training” through their jobs around the school. According to records, eight residents with profound mental retardation spent the day with “recreation”.
In 1915, Dr. McNairy convinced the legislature to change the name of the facility to Caswell Training School. The name Caswell honors Revolutionary War leader Richard Caswell who lived in Lenoir County and served as the first governor of the independent state of North Carolina. The word “Training” was dropped from the school name in 1959 to distinguish Caswell from state schools for delinquent youth. The facility was named Caswell Center in 1963.
During much of its early existence Caswell Center operated on a shoestring budget. When both dormitories burned in the winter of 1918, 53 residents were sent home, others were sent to Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh, and there was some question whether the school would survive. With an appropriation here and a bond issue there, new buildings sprouted on campus. Before groundbreaking ceremonies were held for each dormitory, the school had a list of residents waiting to move in. Because medical research into the causes of mental retardation was in its infancy, many people who would not be considered for admission today were admitted. Unwed mothers, juvenile offenders, persons with multiple handicapping conditions, and children with mental retardation, slept side by side in massive dormitories filled to overflowing with cots.
Caswell’s census reached 2,000 before other state facilities were opened to serve people with mental retardation. With sister institutions in Goldsboro, Butner, Morganton and Black Mountain, Caswell today serves citizens in the eastern region of the state. It is an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services in the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services. Caswell continues to have ties to nearly all 100 counties because some older individuals who had been at Caswell since childhood preferred not to transfer as new facilities opened in their home regions. Caswell Center is now home to approximately 430 individuals whose average age is 56 years.
When Dr. Hardy proposed Caswell Center, his emphasis was on medical treatment. In 1976, Caswell’s first administrator with a doctorate in education, rather than medicine, was hired. The chief administrator is now called the director rather than the superintendent.
Programs today are designed to meet the needs of individuals. Some areas on campus provide arts and crafts classes, music therapy, sensory stimulation activities and off-campus outings as suitable. Psychological counseling and creative expressions are also provided for individual needs. Children are no longer admitted to Caswell Center unless the services they need are not available at home or in the community. An individual is not placed at Caswell for life. Caswell Center is not seen as a place to shelter people with mental retardation. Individuals are admitted for a specific length of time to acquire services that will allow them to return home to enjoy life in the least restrictive setting possible.
Off-campus programs support services to people with mental retardation in their home communities. With training and encouragement from Caswell psychologists, physical and occupational therapists, speech clinicians, and others, parents can receive the support they need to care for their family members at home. Caswell Center staff support group homes and other community agencies by providing consultations and technical assistance. These services are provided as a “safety net” when necessary services are not available in their home counties.",,"Kinston, NC",,,1911,,,,2000,0

By 2006 the facility, under the name O'Berry Developmental Center, served more than 400 clients, offering real-life job training, self-help direction, and other skills to help them lead independent, fulfilling lives.",,"Goldsboro, NC",,,[1957],[None],[None],[150],[400],0
North Carolina,J. Iverson Riddle Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=J._Iverson_Riddle_Developmental_Center,1959,,1963,Active,Cottage Plan,,Western Carolina Center,"The J. Iverson Riddle Developmental Center (originally, the Western Carolina Center) opened in Morganton on 16 Dec. 1963 to provide residential care for the mentally handicapped from the state's western counties-people who otherwise would have had to travel hundreds of miles for assistance. State representatives John W. Umstead Jr., of Orange County, who had a mentally retarded grandchild, and Joe K. Byrd, of Burke County, introduced and secured passage of a bill in 1959 providing $4 million to build a center in western North Carolina. In a subsequent meeting of the North Carolina State Hospital Board of Control, of which Umstead was chair, the decision was made to locate the unit in Burke County rather than Rowan County because the town of Morganton had agreed to furnish sewage treatment service at no cost to the state.
From the beginning, the center's philosophy has been to provide care only after the exhaustion of all other community resources. It has used an interdisciplinary approach toward meeting the needs of profoundly and severely handicapped people while respecting their rights and their due process. The center is believed to be one of the first facilities in the country to develop an aggressive patient advocacy program, a Foster Grandparent Program, and an extensive fine arts program, as well as to stress parental training and early intervention with the families of mentally handicapped infants. The center's name was changed in honor of longtime director J. Iverson Riddle.

North Carolina,Murdoch Developmental Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Murdoch_Developmental_Center,,1940.0,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Butner Training School,"In 1940 the United States Army bought approximately 40,000 acres of land from farmers and started Camp Butner.
During World War II, Camp Butner was a training camp for thousands of soldiers being prepared for combat. There was also a POW camp for German and Italian prisoners. The POW camp was located on the site that houses the Federal Prison today. After World War II, the state of North Carolina bought the Camp for $1,500,00.00 and the Army hospital and furnishings for the sum of one dollar ($1.00) and opened John Umstead State Hospital. The community was officially named Butner. Residents moved to the ""Old Colony"" from Caswell Center, Kinston, North Carolina. The Colony was part of the State Hospital located on 9th and 10th Streets. Residents were housed in two-story barracks once occupied by the Army.
On December 26, 1957, 323 residents and fewer than 60 staff members occupied the present campus which was initially named ""The Butner Training School"". There were 12 buildings designed to serve 57 Piedmont and Western Counties. On April 10, 1958, the school had the ""formal opening and dedication"" in the school auditorium. The late Governor Luther Hodges made the presentation address. Dr. Roy J. Blackley was the Acting Director. The Butner Training School name was changed to Murdoch School. Four additional buildings were constructed. Dr. James F. Elliott was appointed Director of Murdoch School.
Today Murdoch also serves young adult males with developmental disability diagnoses and extreme behavior problems from the entire state in a specialized behavioral unit (BART), and provides statewide, specialized residential services to children who have autism with accompanying severe behavioral challenges (PATH) and adolescents with developmental disabilities, mental health issues and behavioral challenges (STARS).",,,,,,,,,,1

North Carolina,Morrison Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Morrison_Training_School,1923,,1925,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,State Training School for Negro Boys | Cameron Morrison School | Morrison Youth Institution | Morrison Correctional Institution (Current),"Morrison's history began in 1923 when lawmakers authorized the State Training School for Negro Boys at Hoffman. Construction work was started in 1924 and the facility opened in 1925 housing eight youth. In 1939, the name was changed to Morrison Training School in honor of Governor Cameron Morrison. The name was changed again in 1969 to Cameron Morrison School.
The training school closed and the facility reopened as a prison in 1977. Morrison and Sandhills Youth Center were organized as the Sandhills Youth Complex. In 1978, three of Morrison's dormitories were converted to house 100 women inmates. The Sandhills Youth Complex was then composed of Sandhills Youth Center, Cameron Morrison Youth Center and Cameron Morrison Youth Center for Females.
In 1983, the Sandhills Youth Complex was dissolved. The following year, the women inmates were moved to Fountain Correctional Center for Women. Minimum custody males then moved into the Auman and Edwards dorms left vacant by the women inmates. Three wings in Newsome dormitory were left vacant because of poor physical conditions. (Newsome dorm and an administrative building were renovated in 1989 to house the state's first boot camp program.) In October 1988, Cameron Morrison Youth Center's name was changed to Morrison Youth Institution.
Lawmakers provided funding for the building of a 208 bed dormitory and a 20-cell segregation unit to be added at Morrison as part of the $87.5 million prison construction program authorized in 1993. Ground was broken May 4, 1994 for a chapel funded with money raised by prison volunteers.
From 1988 to 2002, Morrison Youth Institution served as a medium security prison for young male felons, 18 to 21 years of age. In January 2002, Morrison was converted to a medium security for adult males, and renamed Morrison Correctional Institution, to help meet the state's growing need for adult male prison bed space. The youth inmates transferred to other youth prison facilities. In July 2002, Impact East was closed and was reopened in June 2003 to house minimum security youthful offenders.
The prison is located on a 175 acre tract. Medium inmates are housed in Aggrey, Bost, and Johnson dormitories. Minimum inmates are housed in Edwards, Jenkins, Auman and Newsome dormitories. It also has an administration building, two schools, a gym, two clothes houses and two dining halls as well as a 20 single cell unit for medium inmates and a 12 single cell unit for minimum inmates.
Inmates attend school with instruction provided by Prisons teachers and Richmond Community College instructors. The prison provides vocational classes in brick masonry, electric service, industrial maintenance, upholstery, cooking school and office practices. Classes for adult education, preparation for the GED tests and college courses are available. Courses on life skills and substance abuse are also offered.",1977 (as a juvenile facility),"Hoffman, NC",,,1925,,208,,,0
North Carolina,Stonewall Jackson Manual Training and Industrial School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Stonewall_Jackson_Manual_Training_and_Industrial_School,1907,,1909,Active,Cottage Plan,Louis H. Asbury,Stonewall Jackson Youth Development Center,"In late nineteenth-century North Carolina, young men convicted of criminal offenses were subjected to the same harsh sentences and punishments as hardened adult criminals. In 1890 James P. Cook, a resident of Concord and editor of the local daily newspaper, the Standard, witnessed a sentence of ""three years and six months at hard labor on the Cabarrus County Chain Gang"" imposed on a 13-year-old boy convicted of petty theft. Distressed at the sight of the lad taken from the courtroom chained to a convicted adult criminal, Cook devoted the next 17 years to a campaign for the establishment of a training school for boys.
Supporters of such a school, particularly the benevolent organization King's Daughters of North Carolina, finally convinced the state legislature to embrace their ""radical"" idea. A special committee of the King's Daughters in 1906 successfully campaigned for the school through public meetings, newspaper articles and editorials, and the dissemination of pamphlets describing the success of reformatories in other states. Success in the legislature was finally assured when sponsors of the bill gained the support of the Confederate veterans in the General Assembly, proposing that the new institution be named in honor of beloved Confederate general Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson, who died during the Battle of Chancellorsville. The act establishing the Stonewall Jackson Manual Training and Industrial School in Concord became law on 2 March 1907.
Governor R. B. Glenn named James P. Cook to the school's first board of trustees. The board then elected Cook as its chairman, a position he held for almost two decades. At a public meeting in Concord on 30 Sept. 1907, the citizens of Cabarrus County appointed a committee to raise funds and locate land to be donated to the training school trustees to secure placement of the new school within Cabarrus County. The fund-raising effort was successful, and the school was located on a site that is now within the Concord city limits. In November 1907, the executive committee of the trustees named Professor Walter Thompson, then superintendent of Concord public schools, the first superintendent of instruction at Stonewall Jackson Training School.
Boys were generally incarcerated for relatively minor scrapes with the law, including school truancy. he General Assembly only allocated a meager $10,000 to the project over a two year period. Unable to purchase a parcel of land adequate for the school, the Board of Trustees reached out to North Carolina communities. Citizens of Concord became interested in the project and raised another $10,000 to purchase a 288 acre tract of land in Cabarrus County. A generous $5,000 donation from the King’s Daughters and North Carolina Federation of Women’s Clubs enabled the construction of two cottages on the property. Construction costs for the first cottage exhausted funds to the point where it could not be properly outfitted. James Cook’s wife took it upon herself to rally local businesses and charitable individuals to donate furnishings and amenities. On January 12, 1909 the school housed its first students and staff in the newly completed King’s Daughters Cottage.
Within a relatively short span of time the school was able to overcome its foundational hardships. Word spread throughout the state that the school had positive outcomes in turning the lives of boys around. As a result the campus rapidly expanded over the next three decades. State funds, support from surrounding counties, and private donations supported the construction of a total of 17 colonial revival style cottages. In 1922 the administration was thoroughly destroyed in a fire. In its stead rose the Cannon Memorial Memorial Hall on the north side of the property. By the 1940′s additional buildings included a gymnasium, pool, infirmary, bakery, laundry, print shop, and other smaller structures.
Legislative policy eventually shifted away from the incarceration of juvenile offenders found guilty of ""status"" offenses such as truancy and undisciplined behavior. As a result, the Stonewall Jackson population had dwindled by the early 2000s to an average of 150 young men, from a peak population of 500 juveniles at the school's zenith. The crimes committed by juveniles confined at the school tend to be much more violent than 20 years ago; many are drug- and weapons-related offenses. Consequently, a fence has been installed to prevent students from leaving the grounds.
In 1999, a fifteen-year battle between the school’s administrators and historic preservationists over several of the institution’s buildings ended. School administrators agreed to help preserve some of the oldest campus buildings if allowed to demolish other derelict buildings on the property. [1]",,"Concord, NC",Colonial Revival,,1909,,,,500,0

North Carolina,Appalachian Hall,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Appalachian_Hall,,,1931 (As a mental facility),Preserved,Single Building,Richard Greene,"USA General Hospital No. 12. | Kenilworth Inn | U.S. Naval Convalescent Hospital, Kenilworth Park | Charter Asheville","Originally opened as a resort/hotel. The primary architecture of the newly constructed resort hotel was Tudor Revival, including rough stone masonry and a re-worked porte-cochere entranceway. Masonry contrasted nicely with stucco and a half timbered exterior, while the half hipped and gabled dormers created a dramatic roof line. Unfortunately, before Chiles could capitalize on his dream of a new Kenilworth Inn, the Army saw the new construction as the perfect place for a wartime convalescence hospital.
James Chiles leased Kenilworth Inn to the Army in February 1918, just one month after the building’s construction was completed. The Army had been expressing their interest in Kenilworth since 1917, when they announced their plans for a hospital to be built in Azalea, NC. But the hospital would not be completed until September 1919. The Army’s decision to lease Kenilworth Inn while their new hospital was being built in Azalea stemmed primarily from the emergent need for a facility that could house sick and wounded soldiers, primarily those suffering from tuberculosis. So Chiles leased Kenilworth to the Army and the building became US. General Hospital No. 12, alternately referred to as U.S. Army Convalescence Hospital No. 12, or more plainly: Biltmore Hospital.
After resuming control over Kenilworth Inn in 1923, Chiles operated the resort hotel with great success until the stock market crash of 1929. Hotel services offered at Kenilworth were contemporary with other Asheville resorts, such as the Grove Park Inn. Both hotels provided rooms that were replete with modern conveniences for the well-paying guest.
Soon after annexation of Kenilworth, bank closings in Asheville caused the Kenilworth Inn Company to default on its payments to Carolina WoodProducts Company. The assets of the Kenilworth Realty Co, including Kenilworth Inn, were sold on the Court House steps for $1200. The Chiles’ holdings were essentially wiped out.
After being sold, Kenilworth Inn sat empty for one year before reopening as a sanatorium. The old structure, with its spacious interior, drew the attention of two local doctors, William Ray Griffin, Sr., and his brother, Mark Griffin, who purchased and then converted the inn into a mental health facility in October 1931.
With an increasing number of patients in need of treatment during the depression, the two doctors were challenged. Their burgeoning practice had outgrown Appalachian Hall, the facility which had operated on French Broad Avenue in Asheville from 1916 until 1931.
The Griffin brothers quickly found that Kenilworth Inn, with its generous use of space, quiet halls, and impressive exterior grounds, suited their method of treatment for mental disorders. The building was renamed Appalachian Hall to maintain the connection with their previous facility.
In order to preserve the layout of the original construction as much as possible, little was changed beyond the name and the addition of examination and treatment rooms. The Griffins also resisted changing the surrounding property so that patients not needing to be placed in isolation might be encouraged to participate in the same outdoor activities as guests of Kenilworth Inn had enjoyed in previous years.
In an era when many of their contemporaries were still providing treatments solely upon physical ailments, the Griffins approach to psychiatry went beyond the standard treatments of hydrotherapy, thermo therapy and electro therapy. The facilities at Appalachian Hall provided a means for treatments that were varied according to the individual and usually included a mixture of approved recreational, occupational, and physical therapies. There were other privately owned mental health facilities in Asheville, but Appalachian Hall, under the supervision of the Griffin brothers, fostered a more forward thinking approach to treatment of psychiatric disorders.
During the Second World War, the United States government again found it necessary to seek locations for battle weary and wounded soldiers to convalesce. In February 1943, Kenilworth’s Appalachian Hall was pressed into service as “U.S. Naval Convalescent Hospital, Kenilworth Park,” and the Griffin brothers’ treatment center was temporarily moved into two Asheville area hotels, the Princess Anne Hotel on Furman Street and the Forest Hill Inn in Kenilworth.
In 1946, the Navy vacated Appalachian Hall and the hospital there was deactivated. The building was then reoccupied by Dr. William Griffin and his brother, Dr. Mark Griffin, and reopened as Appalachian Hall. In the early 1950s, the Griffins helped to incorporate the latest medical advances and treatments at Appalachian Hall, including the use of tranquilizers, application of newly developed diagnostic methods, and labs set up for neurological science and diagnosis.
From the 1950s through the early 1970s, the Griffins made Appalachian Hall a leading light in the Asheville community as a place where patients were provided the latest diagnostic and treatment methods, as well as a relatively secluded and relaxing atmosphere where recreation was as significant to recovery as psychiatric method.
Economics again played a roll in Kenilworth’s history when, in the 1980s, the Griffins sold Appalachian Hall to Magellan Enterprises, a real estate holdings company. The sale of Appalachian Hall can be attributed to increasing costs of maintaining such a large structure as a viable hospital, as well as increasing pressure from major insurance companies looking for shorter treatments and faster results, which naturally went against the grain of the Griffin brothers’ long standing treatment philosophy.
Charter Behavioral Health System purchased Kenilworth Inn in 1994 and the building became known as Charter Asheville. Charter Asheville operated as a 139 bed psychiatric hospital employing 175 people until it closed in 1999. The following year the building was purchased by a private developer and converted into apartments.

North Carolina,Broadoaks Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Broadoaks_Sanatorium,,,1901,Preserved,Single Building Plan,,,"The Broadoaks Sanatorium was opened in September 1901 by Dr. Isaac M. Taylor I, Dr. John McCampbell, and Mr. Felix Scroggs, all of whom had worked at nearby Broughton Hospital. Dr. Taylor served as the hospital’s superintendent until his death in 1921. The sanatorium was one of only two private hospitals in North Carolina during the early twentieth century and was located in the town of Morganton.
Broadoaks treated “patients with nervous diseases of all kinds, mental diseases, including the insane and mild type, selected congenital defectives, epileptics whos minds have become impaired, the aged with senile degeneration of the brain, needing special care not possible at home, and drug habitués. Violent and noisy patients, the very untidy and those otherwise disturbed, are not properly placed in a small institution, and will not be received.”
The sanatorium had beds for 50 patients and sat on a “high hill commanding beautiful views of the mountains.” The hospital is a single building, a converted mansion that was expanded to house the growing patient population. In 1924 a fire killed four patients and destroyed the north and east wings of the hospital. Rescued patients were moved to Broughton Hospital.
After Taylor’s death in 1921, the sanatorium was ran by Dr. James Vernon until its closure in 1959. In 1924, a fire destroyed many of the early structures, and in 1954 the hospital ended in-patient services. Today, only the three-story brick main building remains. Mull Incorporated now owns the building.
Dr. Isaac Montrose Taylor I was born in New Bern, North Carolina, in 1857 and earned his medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York, part of Columbia University. He worked as a physician at the State Hospital, Morganton (now Broughton Hospital) from 1886 – 1901, before opening Broadoaks Sanatorium in 1901. He served as the president of the board of medical examiners of North Carolina from 1915 – 1916. His great-grandson is musician James Taylor.

Carroll, a distinguished psychiatrist. His program of treatment for mental and nervous disorders and addictions was based on exercise, diet and occupational therapy, and attracted patients from all over the country. The hospital was relocated from downtown Asheville to the northern end of Montford Avenue in 1909, and was officially named Highland Hospital in 1912.
The campus included landscaped grounds for patients to recover through means of ""diversion"" and ""productive occupation."" A variety of buildings built in Georgian Colonial, Norman and Arts and Crafts styles housed the patients and the facilities, most of which still stand today including Highland Hall. The campus also included Dr. Carroll's home at 19 Zillicoa Street, known as Homewood. Dr. Carroll's wife and world-renowned concert pianist Grace Potter Carroll, ran a music school at their house from which she gave lessons and held performances for many years. Among her students was Nina Simone, a nationally known jazz musician herself.
In 1939, Dr. Carroll entrusted the hospital to the Neuropsychiatric Department of Duke University. It was during this time that on the night of March 10, 1948, a deadly fire broke out in the main building and took the lives of nine women. Among the victims was author Zelda Fitzgerald, wife of F.

North Carolina,North Carolina Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=North_Carolina_Sanatorium,1907,1907.0,1908,Closed,Cottage Plan,,McCain Hospital | McCain Correctional Hospital,"In 1908, the North Carolina State Sanatorium became the first state institution for the treatment of tuberculosis patients. Several private institutions, or resorts, were operating in western North Carolina before that time but treatment was limited to those who could afford it. Dr. J. E. Brooks refused to accept that North Carolina citizens infected with the lung disease had no other option than to stay home and wait to die. As a state legislator in 1907, Brooks secured an appropriation of $15,000 to purchase land and build a sanatorium, and an additional $5,000 for maintenance.
The site chosen for the sanatorium is in present-day Hoke County between Aberdeen and Raeford. The fear of spreading the infection led to its construction some distance from the nearest town. The mild winters and summer breezes of the Sandhills region made it the ideal location for patients who often slept on enclosed porches ventilated by air “tempered and filtered by the sand and filtered and perfumed by the pines.” The sanatorium opened on April 4, 1908, with capacity for thirty-two patients. A division for African Americans was established in 1923, a division for prisoners in 1925, and a division for children in 1927. Eventually the sanatorium housed 650 beds. All North Carolina citizens unable to go to a private specialist could attend the sanatorium’s diagnostic clinic. However, the waiting list for a bed often was long and it could take nine or ten months for someone to be admitted. Treatment lasted six months to two years and consisted of strict regimens of rest, medication, and in some cases surgery.
The North Carolina State Sanatorium was the parent of the state sanatorium system, which grew to include Western North Carolina Sanatorium near Black Mountain in 1937, the Eastern North Carolina Sanatorium in Wilson in 1942, and Gravely Sanatorium in Chapel Hill in 1953. The town where the first state sanatorium was located bore the name Sanitorium until 1948. At that time, it was renamed McCain in honor of Dr. Paul P. McCain who had served as superintendent and medical director from 1924 to 1946. In 1973, the State Sanatorium became McCain Hospital. With the increasingly low incidence of tuberculosis, the hospital was transferred to the Division of Prisons in October 1983. It served as a minimum custody health care center for male inmates before being closed in 2010.",2010,"Raeford, NC",,,1908,2010,650,,,0
