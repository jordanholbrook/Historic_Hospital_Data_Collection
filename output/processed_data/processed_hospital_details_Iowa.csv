Liebbe,Cherokee State Hospital for the Insane | Cherokee Mental Health Center  | Cherokee Mental Health Institute | Iowa Lunatic Asylum | Cherokee Lunatic Asylum,"The Cherokee State Hospital is a psychiatric hospital located in Cherokee Iowa. It is currently the fourth and last institution to be built in Iowa. It is still in operation with a special treatment program for drug addicts and alcoholics. It is preserved to look like it did when it first opened. This hospital was the last of the four state mental hospitals to be built in Iowa and the only one where the main building, a connected complex in Kirkbride plan, was fully completed before the hospital was opened to patients. The architects were an Iowa firm, Josselyn and Taylor, and the overall form and massing of component portions of the building suggests a French chateau, while the small-scale decorative motifs are those of the Queen Anne Revival Style. The functional arrangements reflect a moderately conservative approach for the times in the care of mental illness.

The allowance for support is $15 per capita until population exceeds 600, then $14 per capita per month until population exceeds 750, when it is reduced to $13 per capita per month. When the population exceeds 900 the per capita per month allowance is to be $12. The excess over $12 per capita per month is paid from the state treasury.
The hospital population increased annually with a peak of 1,729 patients reached in December 1945. To accommodate this number, beds were placed in every hospital hall. Then, a statewide campaign was begun to send patients back to their own counties whenever possible The discovery of psychotropic drugs in the 1950s for mental health treatment and the establishment of community-based services mental health centers in the 1960s saw the high census numbers in Cherokee decline. By 2000 the average daily census for the facility approximates less than 50 with lengths of stays shortened to an average of 25 days.
Known as the ""Cherokee Mental Health Institute"" in 2017, the former mental hospital is now one of eleven programs operated under the oversight of the Iowa Department of Human Services at the “Cherokee Regional Resources Center” that is now reduced in size to a 208-acre campus. Public mental health needs of 41 counties for adults and 56 counties for adolescents in the western half of the state are served in various buildings while the South Wing provides housing for individuals in the “Civil Commitment Unit for Sexual Offenders (CCUSO) that provides a secure, long-term, and highly-structured setting to treat sexually violent predators who have served their prison terms, but who, in a separate civil trial, have been found likely to commit further violent sexual offenses.” Most of the South Wing is currently home to CCUSO offenders, the criminally-insane and violent patients; it is surrounded by prison-grade fencing.
This institution was the place where Dr. Walter Freeman, ""The Lobotomist"" had killed a patient when he stepped back for a photo.[1]

Iowa,Clarinda State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Clarinda_State_Hospital,1884.0,1885.0,1888,Closed and Preserved,Transitional Kirkbride Plan,William Foster & Henry F. Liebbe,Clarinda Lunatic Asylum | Clarinda Asylum for the Insane | Iowa State Hospital for the Insane | Clarinda Mental Health Institute | Clarinda Treatment Complex,"The Clarinda Treatment Complex was built in 1884 as the Clarinda State Hospital in Clarinda, Iowa of southwest Iowa. It was the third asylum in the state of Iowa. The original plan for patients was to hold alcoholics, geriatrics, drug addicts, mentally ill, and the criminally insane.
The Clarinda Treatment Complex was built in 1884 as the Clarinda State Hospital in Clarinda, Iowa of southwest Iowa. It was the third asylum in the state of Iowa and remains in operation today. The original plan for patients was to hold alcoholics, geriatrics, drug addicts, mentally ill, and the criminally insane.  An act of the Twentieth General Assembly of the State of Iowa, chapter 201, authorized the appropriation of $150,000 for the purpose of establishing an additional hospital for the insane. The act went into effect April 23, 1884, and provided that the Governor should select three commissioners, with power to locate the site for the hospital somewhere in Southwestern Iowa.
The act provided that not less than 320 acres of land should be purchased in the name of the state, so selected as to insure an abundant supply of good, pure water and to be susceptible of proper and efficient drainage. It was also provided that no gratuity or donation should be offered or received from any place as an inducement for its location; that the commissioners should, as soon as the location was fixed, secure and adopt plans and specifications and estimates for the buildings to be erected. All buildings to be fireproof, the exterior plain and of brick, to be built on the cottage plan; the board to invite bids after publication for 30 days in Des Moines newspapers; the contract to be let to the lowest bidder complying with the requirements of the commissioners. They were to employ a competent architect and superintendent of construction, appoint a secretary and keep accurate minutes of their doings.
The Governor appointed as commissioners the following: E. J. Hartshorn, of Palo Alto County; J. D. M. Hamilton, of Lee County, and George W. Bemis, of Buchanan County. These gentlemen met at Des Moines on May 21, 1884, and organized. George W. Bemis was elected president of the board, E. J. Hartshorn treasurer and J. D. M. Hamilton secretary.
On the 16th day of July, 1884, the commissioners met again at Des Moines for the purpose of deciding upon the site of the new hospital. They had already visited and carefully inspected every site that was being offered as a location. After two full days of deliberation these gentlemen, by a majority vote, selected Clarinda as the place combining in the fullest degree the requirements of the statute under which they acted.
Mr. Bemis resigned his position after Clarinda had been chosen as the site of the hospital and thereby progress was impeded until August, when Governor Sherman appointed George B. Van Saun, of Cedar Falls, to the vacancy thus created. On August 29 the new board convened at Clarinda and reorganized, with Mr. Van Saun as president.
In October, 1884, the commissioners purchased 513 acres of land one-half mile north of Clarinda. Upon this charming site, commanding a beautiful view of the Nodaway Valley, the hospital was built. The site is well drained and there is an abundant supply of pure water. The cost of the land was $29,425. The Pfiefer Cut Stone Company bid $10,788 for the stone work; the Dearborn Foundry Company's bid on the iron work was $22,100; G. W. Parker's bid for roofing and cornice was $3100. These bids were accepted. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company, at its own expense, laid a switch from its St. Joseph branch line, just east of the hospital, down to the hospital.
The firm of Foster & Liebbe, of Des Moines, was engaged to design and supervise the entire structure. These men determined in the outset to enlighten the commissioners and themselves as well in the latest and best methods of hospital building. To this end they suggested an extensive tour of this country. Upon their return the outline plans were projected, submitted, criticized, remodeled and a plan was adopted.
The plan adopted is somewhat in violation of the strict letter of the act creating the hospital and is what is known as the ""Corridor Connected Pavilion "" plan, consisting first of a central administration building containing the official and executive departments of the institution, connecting by a rear corridor to the hospital system to the right, left and rear. At the right is the female wing, at the left the male wing and at the rear are the maintenance and operative sections. Like most of the earlier state institutions, the appropriations were so limited that only a part of the institution as designed could be erected during any biennial period. Instead of attempting to lay the entire foundation and then waiting for additional appropriations for the superstructures and so attempting the whole group at one and the same time, the wiser policy was pursued of first erecting the administration building and one wing. These were finished in advance, with temporary arrangements for heating and culinary work. Thus earlier accommodations were provided for patients sadly needing relief from the poorhouses of counties, which were worse than prisons.
On the 4th day of July, 1885, the corner-stone was laid by the Iowa Grand Lodge of Masons. The Governor was present with many other distinguished men of the state. By December, 1885, the central building and supervisor's department were under roof and one wing nearly so. In 1886 an appropriation of $103,000 was secured with which to carry forward the work. The hospital was first opened for occupation December 15, 1888, with 222 male patients received from Independence, Mt. Pleasant and Mercy hospitals.
The commissioners filed their final report and were dissolved by an act of the Twenty-second General Assembly, which at the same time created a Board of five Trustees. The first board consisted of E. J. Hartshorn, president; L. B. Raymond, secretary; J. H. Dunlap, J. D. M. Hamilton and Edward H. Hunter. These officers came into power March 14, 1888, assuming the duties and powers of the commission dissolved by the act aforesaid. The board elected L. E. Darrow treasurer. The board also elected P. W. Lewellen, M. D., of Clarinda, as the first superintendent, who selected Dr. J. M. Aiken, of Clarinda, assistant physician, M. T. Butterfield, steward, and Mrs. Alice W. Lewellen, matron.
With occupation came activity. Patients were set to work, grading, sodding, tree planting and farming.
Additional appropriations were made from session to session and in like fragmentary manner wings and wards were added year by year, until in 1897 the hospital stood complete. The first building erected was the administration building with its connecting corridors, the supervisors' section and the east wing. Next the kitchen and help's departments, then the west wing and cold storage buildings. After this the permanent boiler house and east infirmary wards and at last the west infirmary wards.
It is difficult to give an intelligent pen picture of this ample structure. Its total frontage is 1128 feet; its total depth 840 feet, with a length of extended walls of one mile and a quarter and covering many miles of floor space. It provides comfortable apartments for 1000 persons.
The style of the buildings is what is called modern Gothic, most appropriate for the material used in its construction, brick and stone with steep slated roofs and such variety of outline and form that from all points of view there is harmony with contrast, a light and shade that ever pleases the eye. The height of the buildings is generally three stories, though the administration building is four.
The structure is fireproof, being composed of brick, stone, steel, plaster, tile and cement. The hospital is especially noted for its light, secured by a judicious separating and spacing of its wings and sections. The shade of one wing does not darken the windows in the adjacent wing. No pains, especially in the newer and later wards, have been spared as regards the sanitary features. Thousands of air flues and ducts facilitate a constant circulation of pure air and by these means carry out all impure air, the latter being accelerated by numerous electric fans. The structure is amply warmed in the winter season by low pressure steam, all from the boiler house at the rear, where many large boilers afford all needed steam both for heat and power. The buildings are lighted by electricity which is generated in the dynamo room at the rear. Good, wholesome water is obtained by a steam-driven deep-well pump and a chain of storage cisterns, besides numerous soft water cisterns. There are infirmary wards with circular bay dormitories, large open fire places and toilet arrangements.
Various industries have been a prominent feature in the economy of this hospital. Thus there has been continually in operation for a number of years a department for the manufacture of clothing. Here all clothing worn by the patients, both men and women, is made, with the exception of white dress shirts for the men and hose and hats. Cloth and material are bought in large quantities by the bolt and are cut by a tailoress and made into clothing under her supervision by several assistants and a number of patients. Clothing not sufficiently worn to be condemned is repaired and put in a suitable condition for further use. A second very satisfactory industrial department is the shoe shop, where all the footwear for both men and women is manufactured under the direction and supervision of a shoemaker, who is assisted by patients who have a liking and aptitude for that class of work. Another industry is that of wood working, where furniture of various kinds is made and repaired; This is located in a separate building, and here under the supervision of a foreman some 12 to 25 convalescing or mildly disordered patients may be seen every week day busily engaged in planing, scraping, matching and manufacturing all sorts of wooden articles and useful pieces of furniture. A simple, modest equipment of machinery is installed in this place and is used to good advantage.
In connection with this industrial building is a broom-making department, where all the brooms needed for the hospital are manufactured. The only thing bought is the twine wire and occasionally broom handles, which, however, are used over and over again until"" practically worn out. Broom corn is raised on the farm and usually a two-years' supply is laid in stock.
A mattress making department is also connected with this building, where in a separate room all the new mattresses used in the institution are made. Mattress hair is bought and also a good quality of material for the cover, which is made up in the sewing room and afterwards filled by patients, who become quite expert in the making of mattresses and who work under the supervision of the foreman of the industrial building. Soiled or worn mattresses in which the hair has become packed are taken apart, thoroughly renovated by steam, dried, thoroughly picked and the hair used over again. Part of the time a tin shop is operated in connection with the industrial building, although it is located in a different building, and the needed repairs to the tinware of the institution are made, but the manufacture of new tinware has not been attempted to any considerable extent.
In the amusement hall chapel services are held each Sabbath and frequent plays performed for the benefit of the inmates. Performances are put upon the stage by the talent of the institution; the medical staff, below the superintendent, frequently participating and the attendants nearly always taking some part. There are frequent dances in this hall to exhilarate and enliven the many patients who engage in the amusement. The hospital band has for years been the pride of the hospital and of the town as well.
Dr. P. W. Lewellen was the first superintendent. On December 31, 1892, he resigned his position. Dr. Frank C. Hoyt was his successor. The board brought him from St. Joseph, Mo., where he had found wide experience in the hospitals of that state. He resigned his position on September 30, 1898, in order to take up a cherished project in Chicago, and the board selected Dr. Max E. Witte, of Mt. Pleasant, as his successor. Since October 1, 1898, Dr. Witte has filled the place to the entire satisfaction of the state.
On the 1st of July, 1898, the Clarinda State Hospital was put under the charge of the Board of Control of State Institutions.
The institution at that time had a capacity and population of 811 patients, and this number was rapidly increasing from year to year so that an increase in capacity became necessary. This has since been furnished by the erection of two large fireproof cottages; one for men (South View Cottage), with a capacity of 104, and another for women, with a capacity of 100. These cottages have served their purpose well, are of sightly appearance and pleasing construction, and conveniently arranged so that they meet the needs of a certain class of patients in an admirable manner; besides this, the state acquired land about three-fourths of a mile distant from the institution, where a fireproof cottage (Willowdale), with a capacity of 40 patients, has been constructed and is maintained and operated much on the plan of ""Graycroft"" at Utica, N. Y. For convenience, greater comfort and efficiency, many improvements and alterations have been made in the main building in the way of installation of more modern machinery for the purpose of lighting, ventilating and more efficient heating of the institution, besides a plant for the manufacture of artificial ice and refrigeration for all necessary cold storage needs.
Various little industries were early installed at this institution and have been maintained with pleasure and benefit to patients as well as economy in the administration of the institution.
Profitable and pleasant employment and recreation are provided as largely as possible for all patients who can thus be benefited ; and this being above everything else an agricultural state, most of the male patients find helpful employment about the farm, gardens, green-house and the various stables. This is not only primarily a matter of paramount importance as a diversion for the patients, but often proves remedial; besides its economical value is not inconsiderable. The institution supplies all its needs in garden vegetables, with the exception perhaps of potatoes, of which article additional purchases are often necessary. It produces all the milk, fresh pork and lard consumed at the institution, besides a share of the poultry required.
The farm land belonging to the State Hospital at Clarinda, in 1898, consisted of some 500 acres. This has been increased to 860 acres by purchase; and barns, stables and other means have been added to ensure a more successful administration of hospital affairs. The grounds in the immediate vicinity of the hospital buildings have been beautified according to a consistent and artistic plan, so that the surroundings are more pleasing and beautiful than ever before and bid to be more so in the future.
Patients are committed to the hospital without previous consultation of hospital authorities. Upon entrance all patients, irrespective of conditions, are confined to bed for a few days at least until physicians and nurses can be more familiar with the patient. They are also, within the first few days of their admission, carefully examined as to their physical and mental or nervous disorders or anything abnormal which presents itself. Where the history accompanying the patient is defective it is endeavored to obtain further information from friends and correspondents and others who may have knowledge pertaining to the patient's previous life. The history of each individual patient is kept up and memoranda made at stated intervals and as much oftener as changes in the patient's condition may render it desirable.
Patients are classified according to condition. The acute are cared for in specially equipped wards by nurses who are selected for the requirements of the ward for disturbed and acute cases. The sick are maintained in a regular hospital ward for the sick employees. The infirm are kept on special wards and those on the men's side are in charge of women nurses. The tubercular patients are cared for in special rooms on certain wards. An appropriation has been asked for the erection of a regular tuberculosis pavilion and also for a special building with a capacity of 200 for new and disturbed patients of both sexes. There are maintained for each sex special wards for the care of epileptic patients.
The training school for nurses was organized in the early 1890's and has been maintained ever since. A three-years' course of eight months of theoretical and practical instruction, which includes general and surgical nursing as well as that peculiar to mental disorders, is maintained and satisfactory work and successful passing of a searching examination is rewarded with a diploma as graduate nurse. This diploma is accepted by the State Board of Health and permits the holder to come up for examination, although it is usually advised that a short service in a hospital with practical obstetrics be taken.
The general spirit of the institution is to have the asylum idea as much in the background as possible and to supply surroundings and influences as much like those at home as can be made. In this connection a farm cottage with a capacity of 50 patients is maintained, distant three-fourths of a mile from the main structure.[1]
Staff from 1909-1910:
The hospital is currently known as the Clarinda Treatment Center. The CTC has evolved into a multi- functional state facility that now includes a mental hospital and a correctional facility that share many services with the privately owned Clarinda Academy. The original central building still remains in use as part of hospital complex. In 1980 a minimum security all male prison was built as the Clarinda Correctional Facility and another 750 bed medium security prison was opened on the Campus in 1996. A museum was recently added to the complex and is full of historical asylum artifacts such as medical equipment, paperwork, furniture, photos and other relics. In 1980, a large minimum security prison was built as the Clarinda Correctional Facility.[2]
The hospital was closed by Governor Branstad along with Mount Pleasant State Hospital in July, 2015. The Clarinda location has the Clarinda Academy, a privately run school for troubled adolescents, which will continue to operate there for the time being.[3]

Pleasant, Cherokee and Clarinda. The Independence state Hospital is a state run mental asylum in Independence, Iowa. Like many Kirkbrides, there is a labyrinth of underground tunnels which connect every building and were used to transport patients during winter, and a cemetery on the grounds. Little has been changed, so it looks similar to when it did when it first opened.
The “Mission Statement” of the Mental Health Institute, Independence is “To assure that the mentally ill adult citizens of Northeast Iowa and mentally ill children from Eastern Iowa have the opportunity to attain their maximum level of functioning by having available highest quality of inpatient psychiatric care through the institute.”
The “Vision Statement” of the Mental Health Institute, Independence, is “To foster a therapeutic environment for persons with mental illness, which preserves patient’s self-respect and dignity, assures optimum care and treatment, and enhances patient functioning and independence.”
During the middle of the 19th century, at about the time the Civil War was drawing to a close, there was a growing incidence of mental illness in Iowa. At that time, there was only one state facility for the mentally ill, located at Mt. Pleasant in the southeast corner of the state. In operation but a few years, it quickly became overcrowded. A bill passed by the Iowa Legislature on April 6, 1868, appropriated money for the building of a second hospital for the insane. It was to be located west of Independence. The new asylum became a reality when the doors opened and patients admitted on May 1, 1873. It was built at a cost of $845,000 and took 10 years to complete. The walls of the main building are made up of stone taken from the quarries around Farley and Stone City, while the foundation is of prairie granite. The latter was a plus for the State of Iowa, as the contractor was not obligated to use material this durable. There was a lot of prairie granite laying in the fields in this area during the mid-19th century. There was a French influence here in the mansard roofs, lofty arched windows, decorative slating, bracketed eaves, domes, corner towers and ornamental roof turrets. Due to circulation capabilities, the main building was credited with contributing to the physical heath of patients during those early days.
The landscape artist, J.J. Weidenmann, was a professional of some renown, for he did the State Capitol grounds in Des Moines, as well as some work on Central Park in New York City. He was employed here to furnish all the plans for improvement of the grounds, drainage, roads, drives and walks, grading and lakes, also a map for guidance of the gardener in the planting of trees. This work, incidentally, was done largely by patients treated here at the time.
The landscape gardener, in those early years, was a man by the name of Jonathan Bland. His roots were in England. Before alighting in Independence, he stopped off to landscape the parks in Toronto, Canada. During Bland’s time, there were 300 acres of garden at this hospital, the entire grounds being laid out in floral gardens, with paths running through them. According to legend, following a request by the Superintendent’s wife, Bland took to growing chrysanthemums one summer and by November he had some that were “at least a foot in diameter.”
Many changes have taken place at the Independence facility over they years. The name has changed at least twice. In the beginning, it was known as the Hospital for the Insane, or the Insane Asylum. Later, it was re-named The State Hospital, and then the Mental Health Institute, one of four in the Iowa Department of Human Services umbrella. There was a time, many years ago, when this hospital, like many others over the land, was a custodial facility, with patients staying here for long periods. A sizable number spent the greater part of their lives here.
Over a 10 year time span, from 1937 until 1947, there were just under 1,800 patients residing here daily, with an average yearly admission rate of 700. Needless to say, the hospital in those times was very overcrowded and the care minimal. Patients, in effect, were warehoused. Progress began shortly after the end of the Second World War. The really big assist came in 1957, when an enlightened legislature placed emphasis on recruiting qualified professional staff, in lieu of stressing more ‘brick and mortar.” This, combined with the advent of newer treatment methods, especially psychoactive medications, led to creation of an active treatment program.[1]

A modern psychiatric hospital for the evaluation and treatment of both men and women was built on a 54.4 acre site near Iowa City. When completed in 1969, the building consisted of three patient units totaling 81 beds. At the time of its completion, IMCC was considered to be in part of the country-side, away from the major populations of the cities of Iowa City, Coralville and North Liberty. Today it is surrounded by the major metropolitan areas of those three cities. Condos, restaurants and malls are now where escape posts used to be located. [1]",,"Oakdale, IA",,,1969,,81,,,0
Iowa,Iowa State Psychopathic Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Iowa_State_Psychopathic_Hospital,1919.0,,1921,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"Although it is difficult to specify the exact date when the Iowa Psychopathic Hospital began, a university committee recommended the creation of a psychopathic institute to investigate the nature, cause, and treatment of mental disease as early as 1910. The General Assembly appropriated funds to build the Iowa Psychopathic Hospital in 1919 and construction began soon after. The hospital functioned from an annex of the main university hospital until construction was completed in 1921. This is thought to be the first university affiliated psychiatric department west of the Mississippi.
The hospital was established by the General Assembly to “1) make intensive efforts by the best known methods to cure mental illness, mental diseases; 2) teach well established methods of diagnosis and treatment of mental disease to medical students and to teach abnormal psychology to the university students; and 3) carry on scientific investigations into the nature and causes of mental diseases and to endeavor to suggest, to the people and officials of the state, effective ways of preventing mental breakdowns.”
The General Assembly clearly viewed the mission of the Iowa Psychopathic Hospital as distinct from the work of the four existing state hospitals for the insane (the first was Mt. Pleasant in 1861) and the two state hospitals for mentally defective and epileptic patients. Although many things have changed in the Iowa Psychopathic Hospital since 1920, including additions to the building for psychiatric research in 1962 and the Children’s Psychiatric Hospital in 1963, becoming a part of University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in 1976, and the move to the Pappajohn Pavilion in the main university hospital in 1991, the department has never lost its focus and commitment to the primary missions given by the General Assembly in 1919.[1]",1991.0,"Iowa City, IA",,,1921,,,,,0

In the early years of its operation, the facility was a custodial facility for patients who were hospitalized for long periods of time, some for the greater part of their lives. Mt. Pleasant went through the years updating the building as needed. 1870 saw the purchase of thirty-seven and a half acres of serviceable farmland. Four years later, the engine house caught fire destroying the boiler of the hospital. The General Assembly immediately appropriated funds for construction of a new boiler house. During this period, worry over tuberculosis dominated many municipalities including the city of Mt. Pleasant and the asylum. The board of trustees constructed and implemented a new tuberculosis cottage. In the same year, 1878, it expanded the kitchen and improved the transportation of water throughout the facility.
By 1884, both hospitals were in the middle of huge development projects. Mt. Pleasant erected additional east (men's) and west (women's) wings; completed in 1885 and 1887, respectively. Although each hospital provided care for hundreds of additional patients, roughly 200 per expansion, it still fell short of solving the population problem. The government removed dangerous and criminally insane and moved them to the newly built the department for the criminally insane in Anamosa.
On August 10, 1936. A fire consumed parts of the main building, chapel, recreation building, and employee dormitory. Mt. Pleasant evacuated all 1,300 plus patients. Hundreds from the town came out to aid the insane; they formed a human chain to contain the meandering patients. One woman wandered off and was never heard from again. Iowa immediately appropriated $215,000 for repairs, with up to $502,000 available over the next two years for construction. Mt. Pleasant turned the catastrophe into an opportunity to redesign the damaged space into a more modern medical facility. The Board of Control drew up plans for a larger, combination chapel and amusement hall with a centralized kitchen. The new spaces could relieve overcrowding by 1,000.
In 1946, the facility reached its peak occupancy of 1,581. Since 1945 however, new therapies and medications have helped decrease the facility's population, and the individual's average length of stay has been reduced from years to a matter of weeks.
The Center for Psychiatric Care (Adult Psychiatric Services and Dual Diagnosis) is accredited by the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services. The Iowa Residential Treatment Center is licensed by the Iowa Department of Public Health, and is currently operating on a three-year accreditation which was received in 2005.

In 1888 the Legislature made an appropriation of $1,000 and appointed commissioners to investigate and report on the best method of furnishing employment to the adult blind within the State of Iowa. Upon the reception of their report the Legislature passed an act, which was approved by the governor on April 23, 1890, appropriating $40,000 to build and equip an “Industrial Home for the Blind,” with a capacity of 200 inmates. Half the appropriation was to be expended on workshops and a steam heating plant; $4,000 for a men’s building and a similar sum for a women’s building, the remainder to be used as the commissioners might elect. The act also authorized the governor to appoint five commissioners, one of whom should be a woman, to select a location and erect the buildings.
It was also provided in the act that the commissioners might purchase a site, in case a suitable one was not donated by some county or city that wanted the institution. The people of Knoxville became interested and offered the commissioners fifty acres of land, which was accepted and the Industrial Home for the Blind was opened on January 1, 1892, with F. S. Whiting as superintendent. The first board of trustees consisted of J. H. Nichols, L. T. Richmond, John R. Elliott, Miss Lorana Mattice, John Killen and Robert Colbert. The first three as above named were president, secretary and treasurer of the board, respectively.
Mr. Whiting was succeeded as superintendents by M. C. Gebhart, who served until 1896, when Cambridge Culbertson, of Knoxville, was appointed and held the position until the institution was abandoned in 1900. During the time the home was in existence its inmates made brooms, hammocks, cane chair seats, bead work and some other articles. The institution was intended as a home for such adult blind as were able to work at some occupation, but the opinion became prevalent that it was intended for all the adult blind, without regard to whether they were workers or not, and this may have had some influence upon the situation that led to the discontinuance of the home by the state.
By the act of the Legislature, approved on April 12, 1902, it was provided that “dipsomaniacs, inebriates and persons addicted to the excessive use of narcotics” might be treated in one or more of the insane hospitals of the state. After trying this plan for about two years the state decided, through the Legislature, to convert the abandoned home for the blind into a hospital for such cases. Accordingly, on April 6, 1904, Governor Cummins approved an act, the first section of which is as follows:
The Industrial Home for the Adult Blind at Knoxville shall hereafter be called the State Hospital for Inebriates and shall be used for the detention care and treatment of all male dipsomaniacs, inebriates, and persons addicted tot he excessive use of morphine, cocaine or other narcotic drugs.”
An appropriation of $125,000 was made for the purchase of additional land, domestic animals, tools, implements, etc., and before the summer was over the new institution was opened for the reception of patients. Since then 300 acres of land adjoining the original site have been purchased, giving the hospital a tract of 350 acres immediately outside the city limits of Knoxville to the northwest. Additional buildings have been erected, an artesian well drilled, and in 1914 a large clay working industry was established. At the time the institution was discontinued as the Industrial Home for the Adult Blind it had thirty-seven inmates, who were returned to the counties from which they had been admitted at the expense of the state. At the beginning of the year 1915 the number of inmates in the Inebriate Hospital was 187, with Dr. George Donahoe in charge as superintendent. About that time Doctor Donahoe was appointed superintendent of the Cherokee State Hospital and was succeeded in the Knoxville institution by Doctor Mackin.[1]
As the inmates of the Hospital would escape and cause the townspeople a lot of grief, Knoxville residents soon had the Hospital closed. On August 21, 1920, the buildings were reopened as a hospital for disabled veterans. It had a 171 bed capacity with 125 of the beds filled immediately. In 1922, the federal government purchased the 345 acres, buildings, and greenhouse for $200,000 from the State of Iowa to open a hospital under the Veterans Administration. At the close of 2009, much of the VA hospital was being merged with the Des Moines location. A community-based, out-patient clinic still remains.",1920.0,"Knoxville, IA",,,1904,1920,171,,187,0
Iowa,Glenwood State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Glenwood_State_School,,1866.0,1877,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Civil War Orphan's Home | Glenwood Orphan's Home | Iowa Institution for Feeble Minded Children | Glenwood State Hospital School | Glenwood Resource Center,"The Iowa Institution for Feeble Minded Children was a psychiatric hospital for the treatment of mental retardation located in the Loess Hills adjacent to Glenwood, Iowa.
In 1866, Glenwood was selected as the location of a new state-funded Civil War Orphan's Home following the donation of 15 acres (61,000 m2) by community residents. One of the most notable residents of the orphan home was baseball player and evangelist Billy Sunday. The institution later closed in early 1876.
In March 1876 the Iowa legislature designated the grounds of the former Glenwood Orphan's Home as the location for the first Iowa Asylum for Feeble Minded Children. Canadian immigrant Dr. O.W. Archibald was appointed the first Medical Superintendent and the facility opened on September 1. Archibald's 1877 Annual Report listed 85 children and crowded conditions. It then became the Iowa Institution for Feeble Minded Children and Dr. J.A. Donelan was hired in 1879 as the first ""consulting physician"".
In 1882 Dr. Archibald was replaced as Medical Superintendent by Dr. Francis Marion Powell. At the time of Powell's appointment the institution consisted of the buildings of the Orphan's Home, a 160-acre (0.65 km2) farm, and an additional 20 acres (81,000 m2). In 1884 the Administration Building was constructed based on several principles of the Kirkbride Plan. Also, age restrictions were abolished with the creation of a new Custodial Division and by 1886 the institution was home to 259 people. Additional buildings were constructed as the grounds expanded and the resident population grew to 815 people by 1899.
In 1902 the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad relocated and double-tracked the rail line through Glenwood and cut across the grounds of the institution. In 1903 a tornado struck the facility, killing two children and damaging several buildings.
Dr. Powell resigned in 1903 and was replaced by his former Chief Assistant, English immigrant Dr. George Mogridge. The institution would expand to over 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) during Dr. Mogride's 31 years as Superintendent as it became its own self-contained community isolated from the rest of Glenwood by a wrought iron fence. By 1908 the resident population numbered 1,100 people overseen by a staff of 175 employees.
During the 1930s the institution was described by the WPA Southwestern Iowa Guide as a ""group of modern structures, beautifully landscaped grounds, farm tracts, orchards, and gardens, all tended by those admitted to the institution."" The Guide listed a staff of 20 teachers and 1,814 patients, including 623 children.
Dr. Mogridge retired in 1935 and was replaced by Dr. Harold Dye the next year. In 1939 Dye would help conduct a landmark psychological experiment using residents of the institution and was also replaced as Superintendent at Glenwood by Dr. Thomas Lacey. Dr. Lacey had been serving as the Assistant Superintendent since 1911 and the facility's name was changed to the Glenwood State Hospital School. Following Dr. Lacey's death in 1944 Dr. VJ Meyer was named Superintendent. By 1952 the facility covered 1,185 acres (4.80 km2), including 85 acres (340,000 m2) of gardens, 64 acres (260,000 m2) of orchards, and pasture for the 223 dairy cattle. The resident population was 1,968 people with 310 employees.
Following Dr. Meyer's retirement Alfred Sasser was appointed Superintendent. Sasser arrived in 1957 and soon changed the facility forever. In September 1957 the new Superintendent hosted ""State School Day"" and opened the campus to the public during the dedication of the Meyer School Building. Controversy soon developed after it was revealed in the November 17, 1957 Des Moines Register that resident Mayo Buckner had spent 59 years confined to the facility with a 120 I.Q.. Further attention was attracted to Glenwood by an article on the facility in the December 1957 Time magazine and the March 1958 issue of Life Magazine. The Life article included photographs of the ""side room"" closets where those that misbehaved were forced to remain naked while a light-bulb burned 24 hours a day. The aroused business community of Glenwood responded by revealing that Sasser had lied on his application about having attained a doctorate degree. Sasser resigned in March 1959 and the subject of his tenure at Glenwood was dramatized on television during a December 1959 episode of the Armstrong Theater.
Dr. Peter Peffer served as Superintendent at the Glenwood State Hospital School from 1959 until 1961. Dr. J. Cromwell served as Acting Superintendent until 1964 when Dr. Leonard Lavis was appointed. Dr. Lavis resigned in 1969 and was replaced by Dr. William Campbell. Under Dr. Campbell the Glenwood State Hospital School lost much of its institutional character as the traditional ward-style housing was replaced by individual cottages. Staffing was also greatly expanded during the 1970s and Local 29991 of AFSCME was organized.
In the early 21st century the facility was renamed the Glenwood Resource Center. The resident population numbered almost 400 people with close to 850 employees.[1]

At first it was known as the Reform School and was established by an act of the Legislature in March, 1868, at Salem, Henry County. It was under the management of a board of trustees, made up one from each congressional district. These trustees immediately leased the old Iowa Manual Labor Institute, and on October 7th of that year admitted its first inmate. The law at first admitted both sexes under eighteen years of age. The trustees were at once instructed to organize a separate school for girls.
In 1872 the school was permanently located at Eldora, Hardin county, and forty-five thousand dollars appropriated for necessary buildings. By 1876 the law was so amended that only children over seven and under sixteen years of age could be admitted. Up to 1880 there had been admitted to this school, now known as Industrial School for Boys, eight hundred and eighteen persons. A similar institution was established by the state at Mitchellville, near Des Moines, for girls.
In this school the inmates are taught the elements of education, especially the useful branches, and are also trained in some regular course of labor, as is best suited to their age and capacity and their natural bent of mind. They are kept, usually, until they have reached the age of twenty-one, unless allowed to go before because of their manly conduct. Various trades are taught these erring boys, some whom have gone out into life to become the best of citizens and all possessed of better education and morals than when first taken into the institution. This is not a prison, but a compulsory educational institution. It is a school where wayward boys are brought under the influence of Christian instruction and taught by example, as well as by precept, the better ways of life. It is really a training school where moral, intellectual and industrial education of the child is carried on at one and the same time.
Today the primary purpose of the State Training School at Eldora is to provide a continuum of supervision and rehabilitation programs, which meet the needs of males adjudicated delinquent, in a manner consistent with public safety. These services and programs individualize treatment and control the offender for his own benefit and the protection of society. Those held there are males 12 to 18 years old that have been adjudicated delinquent and who meet one of several criteria.",,"Eldora, IA",,,1868,,,818,,0

The Lewellings were Quakers. Lorenzo was a minister. The Lewellings taught and guided the girls. Even after the girls left the school, Angie wrote to them. In the school's first 30 years, 804 girls lived at Mitchellville. Most of the girls were called ""incorrigible.""
Most of the girls were from poor families and had lost one or both parents through death or divorce. Sometimes when families had sudden problems, such as a lost job or a death in the family, a daughter was sent to Mitchellville because the family couldn't afford to keep her. One girl was from a wealthy family. She had tried to poison a step-parent. Most of them were 13 to 15 years old, though there were some as young as seven. Many of the girls had once lived on their own as maids or workers in button, candy or cigar factories. Three had traveled with acting groups.
Reform schools in Iowa provided a place for children with problems. In some cases the young people who attended the schools had no place else to go. Some of the children who were forced to attend Iowa's reform schools had good experiences and ended up having good lives as adults. But for others the reform school experience was bad. The reform schools of the past were the beginnings of the juvenile court system in Iowa.

Located on Asbury Road, the institution was originally known as the Insane Asylum of West Dubuque. This name was changed to St. Joseph's Sanitarium in November 1909. The facility was planned to provide care for patients suffering mental disorders.
The institution, dedicated on June 7, 1896, with Archbishop John Hennessy in attendance, was described as five different buildings semi-connected in the form of a Roman cross. A four-story administration building standing at the front was flanked by two four-story wings, one reserved for male patients and the other for females. Constructed between the wings and linked to the administration building was a chapel.
The sanitarium was designed by architects Buechner and Jaconson of St. Paul, Minnesota, to accommodate five hundred patients. Twenty-two acres of grounds were associated with the buildings. Despite the initial plans, the sanitarium was expanded in 1897 and became known as St. Anthony's Home for the Aged.
Condemned by state health and fire authorities, the facility on Asbury Road was closed and stood vacant beginning on April 29, 1967, when the last thirty-two patients were transferred to the Mental Health Department at Mercy Hospital. The function of the facility, along with that of Saint Anthony’s Home, became part of the MERCY MEDICAL CENTER. The sanitarium officially closed on June 30, 1967.
In 1968 the land and buildings were sold to the University of Dubuque. Demolition of the buildings began during July to make room for a planned seminary complex. These plans were eventually abandoned, and the land was converted to University Park. This property was later the site of the Red Cross building in Dubuque.",1967.0,"Dubuque, IA",,,1896,1967,,,500,0

Iowa,Clinton County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Clinton_County_Poor_Farm,,,1857,Demolished,Single Building,,Clinton County Poor Farm and Insane Asylum | Parkview Home,"From the he History of Clinton County, 1879 by L. P. Allen
""For many years after the settlement of the county, pauperism was practically unknown. None were rich and none were dependent, except in case of especial “bad luck,” upon their neighbors for favors freely granted and reciprocated. Among the real pioneers were none shiftless or “freckless-” enough to become a charge upon the community. But as the county began to fill up and the pinch of 1857 began to be felt, it became evident that the inevitable provision of civilized communities for the indigent would have to be promptly made.
Accordingly in 1857, a “poor farm” of 200 acres, at $20 per acre, located in Waterford and Washington Townships, besides sixty additional acres of timber were purchased. John McElhatton was appointed Superintendent, and held the position till succeeded four years ago by the present incumbent, John Blessington.
At first, for some time, four to five was the average number of inmates of the Poorhouse, and none were considered an extraordinary crowd. But since the war pauperism has in this county, as elsewhere, rapidly increased, till the average number maintained at the county charge is about thirty, and no less than forty-six have at some times been boarded at the poor-farm. The healthful site, energetic yet considerate management and careful supervision have maintained the institution on a basis, both from a humantarian and business point of view, eminently creditable to Clinton County, especially when compared with the inhuman and unhealthy surroundings of many poorhouses.
The increase of insanity has necessitated additional provision for the county’s incurable lunatics. They are no longer received at the State Asylum at Mount Pleasant, and in the absence of proper local accommodation, have hitherto been maintained in Mercy Hospital, at Davenport, at a cost much above the actual expense of keeping them in suitable local quarters. Hence, the present Board, Supervisors Ruus, Lake and Svendsen, wisely determined to build an in asylum suitable for the present and future needs of the county, as a measure of both humanity and economy. It is now under construction and will be completed during 1879. W. W. Sanborn furnished the plans, embodying the results of the most recent investigations in both this country and Europe, as to the proper economic and sanitary arrangement of buildings occupied by imbeciles or defectives.
The asylum will be three stories high, solidly built of brick and stone, and costing about $5,000. It admirably combines the features of a hospital dwelling and prison. A large yard for the inmates’ exercise-ground surrounds it. The rooms and cells contain twenty-five persons, and, at the present rate of increase of such unfortunates, it will probably not be long before it will be crowded to its utmost capacity, as some time ago fifteen incurables were, by the change in the Mount Pleasant system, thrown back upon the county’s charge.
For some time the pernicious custom of allowing children to be associated with the idle and depraved at the county house, has been practically abandoned. Those who would formerly have naturally been contaminated by association with paupers, are now paternally cared for by Supt. Pierce at the beneficent Orphan’s Home at Davenport, where they are trained to become useful men and women.
If, under the charitable spirit of the nineteenth century, a community’s civilization is measured by the judicious care taken of its defectives and paupers, Clinton County need not hesitate to invite comparison with any similar commonwealth. The contract system of boarding paupers has been replaced by the better one of paying the Steward a fixed salary. Recently the propriety of adding a needed hospital to the other county buildings has been agitated.
From Wolfe's 1911 History of Clinton County
Improvements have been made, from time to time, on the county farm, by erecting the necessary buildings, etc. From the December 31, 1909 report of the superintendent of the farm to the board of county supervisors, the following is shown:
Amount of corn raised, two thousand eight hundred bushels; oats, one thousand two hundred bushels; potatoes, five hundred bushels; tame hay, forty tons.  A total was sold from the farm in 1909, of four thousand seven hundred and thirty-three dollars and eighteen cents.
For the same year, there were received twenty-four inmates; nine died; left and discharged, eighteen; total enrollment for 1909, four hundred and sixty-two inmates. In the insane department of the county farm there were on January 1, 1909, twenty-eight inmates; received during that year, one; died in the year, four; in asylum January 1, 1910, twenty-nine -- males thirteen, and females sixteen. This method of caring for the unfortunate poor and demented has proven all that was claimed for it.  The institution is now almost self-sustaining.  The inmates are cared for in a humane manner, and all are provided with good wholesome food and warm, clean apartments, with the best of common medical attendance.",,"Clinton, IA",,,1857,,,462,46,0

Iowa,Dallas County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dallas_County_Poor_Farm,,,1869/1937,Preserved,Single Building,,Dallas County Care Facility,"Dallas County purchased 160 acres in 1869 to establish a ""poor farm"" to house people who were unable to care for themselves and who had no family willing to keep them. Residents were expected to work to help raise food and cover expenses. Most Iowa counties had at least one such ""poor farm,"" and over time most evolved into places for people with mental disabilities or illnesses. The Dallas County farm eventually grew to 562 acres. The existing two-story brick building was constructed in the 1930s as part of the Depression-era Works Project Administration.
It operated as the Dallas County Hospital from 1934 to 1954 and later as the Dallas County Care Facility, before finally closing in 2014. The land was annexed into Adel in 2015. Dallas County will move several health and human services departments into the newly renovated facility about five miles north of downtown Adel in 2016.",2014.0,"Adel, IA",,,1934,2014,,,,0

Iowa,Jackson County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jackson_County_Poor_Farm,,,1839/1887,Demolished,Single Building,,Jackson County Infirmary,"Jackson County’s poor house/farm became one of the first created in the earliest days of Michigan statehood. Generation after generation of poor souls lived there. Some were blind, deaf or insane, and others just homeless for a variety of reasons. The 1881 “History of Jackson County” documented that 33 people — equal numbers of men and women — lived there then. The men worked about the farm and in the garden, barn and wood pile. The women performed household duties. Fire destroyed the original poor house about 1886 and a new wooden frame building with a brick exterior was built a year later.
After World War II, federal and state governments issued more mandates, and poor houses and farms began to vanish from the social landscape. Counties could no longer warehouse people, but they were expected to provide medical care. By 1950, Jackson County’s poor-home residents were so aged and infirm they were no longer capable of field work. The Social Services Board put the farm up for sale, and on Aug. 15, 1951, the Citizen Patriot reported the sale of 183 acres, for $18,350, to John Jenkins. By about 1960, the grand old poor home was in serious decline. The county put to voters a $1.7 million bond issue to build a new Jackson County Medical Care Facility on Lansing Avenue.
In February of 1963 nearly 90 residents were moved from the old poor home to the new building. And the old building sat empty — except for May 1963, when it briefly served as a hideaway for four escaped Southern Michigan Prison convicts. In the summer of 1964, the poor home was sold to local Seventh-day Adventists for $12,000. They built a school on the property, a short distance from the old home. On April 23, 1967, a father and two sons who had a contract to demolish the old home inadvertently started a fire. They were burning rubbish in an open area when sparks apparently settled in the home’s eaves. Within moments, the top of the building went up in flames.",1963.0,"Jackson, MI",,,,1963,,,90,1

Iowa,Johnson County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Johnson_County_Poor_Farm,1855.0,,1886 (Second location),Preserved,Single Building,,Johnson County Asylum | Chatham Oaks,"The 1855 Johnson County Poor Farm, is a window on nineteenth century definitions and policy dealing with perceived social problems. The need to care for the poor or mentally ill had been established in the United States in the 1820’s as a duty of the state and local governments.  This duty was recognized early in Johnson county history. The County chose first to contract care usually from local physicians. In 1855, the Johnson County supervisors decided to procure 160 acres on the edge of Iowa City for a “poor farm” to provide systematic care with economy.
The early care of the poor and mentally ill was crude by modern standards, reflecting the prevailing attitude that fresh air and work would be good for these “poor unfortunates”. From the earliest days, “inmates” were expected to do farm chores to the extent of their abilities. The farm was to be self-supporting and the labor of the inmates would help compensate the county for their care. Crop farming and dairy production were primary functions of the farm until the 1960's.
Today the early twentieth century milking barn, a late nineteenth century hay/horse barn, five smaller buildings, the “insane” wing, and the cemetery survive. The 1859 “First Johnson County Asylum” wing is restored and listed on the national Register of Historic Places. Though unused for many years, the buildings and acreage have received basic maintenance and many of the original features are intact including a brick cistern outside the horse barn. A unique stock watering system is still in place inside the smaller buildings and the milking barn still has its equipment, stanchions, feed boxes, separating room, cooler and silo.
The patients slept in rooms, the doors with iron bars, locked and padlocks at night. Tranquilizing and energizing drugs were first used about 1948 and more extensively up in to the 1960s. In August 1962, there were 16 mental, 33 retarded patients, and 9 dependents at the County Home - a total of 58 patients.
By 1977, only the insane wing remained of the old complex. Recognizing the building’s “moving and thought-provoking glimpse into the history of public mental health care,” it was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places. It was officially listed on the National Register in 1978. Despite this listing, the asylum’s condition continued to worsen. By 1988, the floor systems and foundation had rotted away. The entire building would have to be raised, straightened and braced while the floor and foundation were rebuilt. Rot had to be removed, the walls and roof needed repair, and new windows and doors were needed. Recognizing the building’s need of repair, the County Board of Supervisors allotted over $60,000 for this restoration. The county hired architects Kruse Associates to supervise the restoration and Don Brus, a contractor with experience in farm and historic buildings. After two years of work, the asylum was opened to the public on September 23rd, 1990
The Johnson County Poor Farm site is important to Iowa’s history, telling the story of the county’s care for it’s citizens from the earliest days until today. The county’s first facility is the asylum and a few hundred feet to the east is the county’s most recent facility, Chatham Oakes built in 1964.(now privatized). Each county in Iowa had a poor farm and the tradition is well represented by the Johnson county farm, which may well be the only remaining intact example. [1]",,"Iowa City, IA",,,1855,,,58,58,0

The C.E. Dickerman farm near Freeport was offered at the purchase price of $2,000 for the
buildings and $25 per acre.  While additional farms were offered up for bid, the Board of Supervisors almost unanimously voted to acquire the Dickerman farm and offered to purchase the property for $4,000.  This deal was accepted and the property became the Winneshiek County Poor Farm. Overwhelmingly, the Board discussed the cost of the farm and not the reasons for purchasing one or any humanitarian aspects of developing a place for the needy.
Between June 1, 1910, and January 1, 1911, the farm had 22 patients and Mr. C.A. Funk was the facility steward. Between January 1 and June 1, 1912, the facility had 23 patients, and between June 1 and December 31 of the same year, the farm had 24 patients. In 1915, changes were made to the county farm. While Mr. Funk remained the steward, the county decided to build an addition to the county home and purchase 4 ha (10 ac) adjoining the property from Robert Price. On June 26, 1915, the Board proposed that a new steward's
building be erected at the county farm and accepted bids for its construction. John H. Austad, a local builder, won the bidding war with an offer of $4,955 for the main building and $1,060 for the kitchen",1988.0,"Freeport, IA",American Foursquare,,1866,,,24,24,0
Iowa,Oakdale Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oakdale_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,1904.0,,1908,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"The Iowa legislature, pressed by physicians to do something about the alarming number of TB cases, appropriated $50,000 in 1904 to establish a sanatorium. In 1908, Oakdale Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which would remain in use until 1981, opened with an administration building and two cottage-style structures, one for men and one for women. A nurses' station connected the cottages. Bed rest, diet and fresh air were the only known treatments at the time, so the cottages were equipped with long open-air porches. The diet emphasized milk and eggs, and the Sanatorium acquired its own Holstein dairy herd and a large poultry house.
One hundred and five patients were admitted to Oakdale in its first five months. In 1910, the number rose to 506 and peaked at 814 in 1926. The largest proportion of patients were young people 20 - 25 years old. A patient's existence was strictly regimented, with lights out and radios off at 9:00 p.m. Daily naps with absolute quiet were enforced from 1:00 to 4:00. The stresses of homesickness and apprehension about health, in addition to the severe life-style, made life most trying for many patients.",1981.0,"Iowa City, IA",,,1908,1981,,506,814,0
