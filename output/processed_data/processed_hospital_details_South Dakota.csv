The facility opened in February 1902 as the Northern Hospital for the Insane with 45 people in a three story building made of Sioux Falls granite. All direct contact staff as well as administrative staff lived there. All legislation concerning establishment, admissions, and support indicates that these facilities were not intended to be used by people who had mental illness, but for those persons who had a developmental disability. In 1913, the name was changed to State School and Home for the Feeble Minded. It became known as The Redfield State Hospital and School in 1951 and in 1989 we took our current name.
Population at SDDC increased rapidly and by 1918, population had increased ten times its original number to 471 persons. This trend in population increase continued until 1963 when the population hit its all time high at 1199 persons. At that time, there were 11 large buildings on campus used for housing. The TB Sanatorium at Custer, SD was remodeled and reopened as The Custer State Hospital and School. Several people were transferred to Custer to ease the crowding at the Redfield facility. The Custer facility was closed in 1996 and the people were moved into the community.
By 1970, the population had dropped to 980 and with the passing of the Developmental Disabilities Act in 1970 which provided for the deinstitutionalization of inappropriately placed persons, the number of people living there dropped quickly. At present, they serve approximately 145 persons with Developmental Disabilities.

South Dakota,Yankton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Yankton_State_Hospital,1878.0,1879.0,1880,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),,Dakota Hospital for the Insane | South Dakota State Hospital | South Dakota Human Services Center,"The completion of the railway into Yankton in 1873 gave added impetus to immigration and by 1878 the effect of the gold rush was reflected in the number of Dakota patients at St. Peter Hospital, totaling 22. Governor William A. Howard was advised in June by Minnesota that no more patients could be accepted after July 1 because of crowded conditions at that hospital and all Dakota patients would have to be removed by October 1, 1878.
The Governor contacted Iowa hospitals without success, then traveled to Lincoln, Nebraska, and found that institution overcrowded but by completing some unfinished rooms, accommodations were arranged for five patients until the following February. Another contract with Minnesota resulted in an extension until February 1, 1879, for removal of the patients from St. Peter.
Governor Howard searched for a building to be used for a hospital in nearby towns of Vermillion, Elk Point and Canton with no success. In Yankton, he found two large wooden buildings--one belonging to the city and one to the Territory that were built to house German-Russian immigrants. The Governor secured the buildings and arranged to have them rebuilt on school lands north of Yankton at personal expense, a total of $2,286.85. The thirteenth session of the Dakota Territory Legislature met on January 14, 1879, and in the Governor’s message he advised the lawmakers of his action and the necessary laws were passed.
During the first six months there were five employees; and, 31 patients were cared for, five being discharged, fully recovered. The appropriation for the first two years was inadequate and citizens generally did not realize that patients needed much more than food and clothing so future legislatures were inclined to reduce recommended allowances for their care, treatment and support.
In 1880, Governor Howard was reimbursed for his personal contribution. At that time, there were 50 patients causing overcrowding and the hospital was understaffed. The population of Yankton was over 3,400, a remarkable increase from the less than 50 in 1859. In 1899, a devastating fire took the lives of seventeen women patients. The catastrophe prompted the state legislature to appropriate much-needed funds to the institution. Laws were enacted requiring fireproof buildings, defining fireproof structures, prescribing smallest area of floor space per patient and describing the minimum per capita amount of air in apartments where patients were kept.
In 1918, the name of the hospital was officially changed from Dakota Hospital for the Insane to the Yankton State Hospital. This was done because of complaints that the original name had a derogatory connotation and other types of patients such as alcoholics and epileptics were also housed there.
The patient population in the mid 1920’s was more diversified than in earlier years. In the late 1920’s and early 1930’s, the institution went through, as did the rest of the nation, a very difficult period. The situation at Yankton was almost impossible to handle; an increasing rate of admissions combined with a decreasing budget. Ironically, money was somehow found to build a nine-hole golf course at the institution during 1930-1931. Overcrowding was a serious problem in the mid and late 1930’s. With the advent of therapeutic treatments, however, incoming patients were released within a few months, thus helping to ease the overcrowding problem.
World War II disrupted the flow of progress. The Selective Service Act, then in effect, forced the hiring of youth too young for the draft or people too old for military service. In addition, wages at the institution were poor and with so many men gone to war, hospital employees left to take up better-paying jobs.
The 1950’s brought increased understanding of mental illness and relatives of patients were more willing to accept them, rather than wanting to hide them in Yankton. Medical work at Yankton in the early 1950’s became more varied and systematized than ever before. Changing attitudes toward the mentally ill contributed greatly to improving conditions at the hospital. Various forms of physical force, such as the use of strait-jackets, were discontinued. The development of antipsychotic medications also brought about a significant reduction in the hospital census.
The 1960’s saw a significant enlargement of the medical staff. The staff was also of better quality than at any previous time. The need was also seen at this time for a geriatric department. The intensive treatment program established in the early 1960’s showed results as the decade wore on, for the population at the hospital continuously decreased year after year.
From 1968-1973, a great deal of activity took place. Construction was started on a new central dietary building as well as a new recreational facility. In addition, Ordway, Herried, Mellette and Kyle Buildings were renovated. On July 1, 1974, the name of the facility was changed from Yankton State Hospital to the South Dakota Human Services Center. The change was enacted by session of the Legislature to more clearly reflect the services offered. The year 1979 marked HSC’s 100th anniversary. Centennial events were held in conjunction with the event.
The 1980’s saw further development in services and programs available to HSC patients. In 1989-1990 changes took place at HSC following reorganization of the state Board which previously coordinated the Center’s work. In 1988, voters abolished the Board of Charities and Corrections, which was created under the South Dakota Constitution to handle the state’s inmates and patients in need of various services. In place of the Board, two new cabinet-level departments were created which separated the responsibilities for inmates from those of patients. The Department of Human Services, one of the two newly-created Departments became the governing authority for HSC.
In 1991, Governor George S. Mickelson directed that a study of the existing HSC campus be conducted. This study found it would be more costly to upgrade existing buildings than construct new ones specifically designed for patient treatment. Governor Mickelson advanced bills proposing design and construction of a new psychiatric facility which passed by an overwhelming majority of the 1992 Legislature.
Dedication and Ground Breaking Ceremonies were held on April 28, 1994. Recognizing the efforts of Governor Mickelson, the new facility was dedicated ""George S. Mickelson Center for the Neurosciences."" The new facility was completed in the fall of 1996 and was occupied in October of that year. The Human Services Center is a state-of-the-art treatment center providing inpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency treatment services to South Dakota’s residents.[1]

The cemetery on the grounds is still maintained by the facility & contains over 1,000 former patient burials.  The majority of the graves are marked only with the person's Patient Record Number on a small, concrete pillar. The few exceptions are a handful of graves where the family has replaced the concrete marker with a conventional headstone showing name, dates, etc. To obtain information about cemetery records or for procedures for adding a grave marker, please contact the South Dakota Human Services Center at 605-668-3100.

South Dakota,St. Joseph's Indian School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Joseph%27s_Indian_School,,,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Chamberlain Indian School |  St. Joseph's School,"The school was founded as a Catholic mission school in 1927 by  Henry Hogebach, a Roman Catholic priest from Germany. School opened in the fall of 1927 with 53 Lakota (Sioux) boys and girls.
As a residential school, it provided dormitories for a range of Native American children, primarily from the Lakota and Sioux reservations on the Great Plains. The school was originally directed to assimilate Native American children to the majority United States culture, influenced by European traditions.
In November, 1929; Thanksgiving week, two government doctors and a nurse paid the school a visit to look after the health of the children. Six had their tonsils removed and five had their eyes operated on for Trachoma.
In early January, 1930 the laundry building was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt in the Spring. The original school was destroyed by fire in 1931, and was slowly rebuilt over the next few years before the Depression, with great help from Catholic donations.
During the Depression (1934-1935), many nurses and children fell ill and had little to eat, the pipes often froze, and the electricity was cut off. One nurse's journal from the time reports-- ""The depression is at its peak and times are hard.  In the spring Sr. Pauline took sick and had to be taken to the Pierre Hospital.  She recovered somewhat, but before the new school year opened the Lord called His faithful handmaid home.  Sister Cecilia and Helen Durkin were quarantined for several weeks after contracting scarlet fever. Many of the children were undernourished and sickly.  In November we sent one little girl away because her condition was a danger to the other children with whom she associated.  She had neither parents nor home.  An old Indian lady took her, but she was very poor and had not much herself.  We tried everything to get the child into a hospital or sanitarium.  We had no success the girl developed tuberculosis and died three months later.""
On January 7, 1941 Fr. Henry was killed in a car accident, leaving Sr. M. Raphael Superior to run the school the following year; with 160 children. In 1942 a huge number of seagulls came in to eat the growing grasshopper and pest problem; bringing good hay and fate livestock to the school. The ongoing war brought higher prices for everything the school produced. At the same time many of the older boys at the school were leaving for Military Camp with the US Army.
By 1950 the enrollment had grown to 230 children, many of them small. It was also during this time (1956) that the Our Lady of the Sioux Chapel was built. Yet the graduation class in 1953 numbered only 16. In 1960 the enrollment was up to 331 with a new Principal, Sr. Canicia; numbers the school was not built to hold. And in 1968 a new dormitory building (current Akta Lakota Musuem and Cultural Center) was built to relieve overcrowding.
In 1970 the present dining hall was completed, and in 1975 a swimming pool was added to the grounds. From 1980-1983 the conversion from dormitories to residential living units was completed. Each home houses 10-12 students and one houseparent.
The school continues to be owned and operated by the Priests of the Sacred Heart, non-Native Americans. In the 21st century, approximately 200 Native American children attend the residential school. Today students live in family-style group homes with other students. The school's campus expanded throughout the 1990's, and continues to expand breaking ground on a new health center in 2016.
In the 2010s, St. Joseph's School has been investigated for several issues related to its fundraising practices. In 2013 the school failed to meet the give.org standards for charity accountability. n 2014 it was the subject of investigative reports by CNN and Indian Country Today. The school sent out mass mailings featuring offers of made-in-China dreamcatchers and fictional, emotional letters from nonexistent students. The school has been criticized by the Better Business Bureau for sending out a letter claiming they had insufficient funds to heat the school. At the time of this claim, the school had millions of dollars free to spend.",,"Chamberlain, SD",,,[1927],[None],[None],[None],[331],1

South Dakota,Hiawatha State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hiawatha_State_Hospital,,1902.0,1903,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Hiawatha Insane Asylum | U.S. Indian Insane Asylum,"In 1903 the U.S. Government opened the Hiawatha Insane Asylum for American Indians. The purpose was to care for those members of tribes who were allegedly insane. The asylum was operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Indians who made up most of the population of the asylum were Indians seen by the Government as ""trouble makers""-- spiritual leaders, medicine men, vision quest seekers, those who resisted reservation boundaries, and boarding school students who did not conform to school policies.
These individuals were termed ""idiotic Indians"" for what they believed and continued to believe. During the years that the asylum was in existence, tribes or tribal members were clearly a relatively powerless political group who were unable to demand anything of their interest. In 1933 the remaining patients were moved to St. Elizabeth's State Hospital in Washington D.C. after investigations into patient abuse. The property was used for a short time as a prison then by Augustana College. From 1946 to 1975 the Canton-Inwood Hospital Association took over the property, after that the remaining buildings were demolished.
The city of Canton SD redeveloped the property, including a golf course built over the patient cemetery. In between the fourth and fifth fairways one will find a split rail fence surrounding the small cemetery, a concrete monument that has seen better days sits towards the middle at the back bearing the names of those interred there. A small sign in red is posted at each entrance stating that golfers may not hit balls from inside the confines of the cemetery. The Country club maintains the cemetery, which is now on the National Historic Register.

South Dakota,South Dakota State Penitentiary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=South_Dakota_State_Penitentiary,,,,,,,,"The South Dakota State Penitentiary also known as the Sioux Falls State Penitentiary is located in South Dakota's largest city, Sioux Falls, and holds the state's most deadly and dangerous criminals, as well as sex offenders. It was built in 1881. The building's industry shop makes several things for the state, including license plates.
The South Dakota State Penitentiary is located in northern Sioux Falls, occupying approximately thirty acres. First constructed as a territorial prison in 1881, it became the South Dakota State Penitentiary when South Dakota was granted statehood in 1889. Though a large portion of the original buildings remain, numerous structural changes have occurred over the years. 
The main Penitentiary facility contains three housing units. The G. Norton Jameson Annex began housing inmates in February 1993. The Jameson Annex contains three housing units within a secure perimeter and a minimum security unit known as Unit C, which is located outside the perimeter fence.
Inmate employment within the Penitentiary falls into two basic categories; institutional support and prison industries. Institutional support includes those employed in food service, as clerks for various departments, as cell orderlies and those working in maintenance. Prison Industries consists of upholstery, printing, sign, decal, license plates, carpentry, book bindery, machine shop, Braille unit, garments and data entry. All but the garment and data entry work is done at the Penitentiary. Most of the work is done for government agencies. Inmates are offered literacy, Adult Basic Education and GED classes.
The penitentiary was designed by Wallace A. Dow and constructed in 1882. The warden’s residence was completed in 1884. In the 1890s, prisoners quarried stone to build a wall to enclose the prison yard. The penitentiary is the subject of Sioux Falls’s most persistent urban legends, that Sioux Falls chose the penitentiary over the university because the state would always need a jail, but it is not true. In 1881, Richard Pettigrew lobbied for and succeeded in getting a federal appropriation to construct the jail in Sioux Falls, which can be seen from the Big Sioux River.",,,,,[1881],[None],[None],[None],[None],1
South Dakota,Battle Mountain Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Battle_Mountain_Sanitarium,1902.0,,1907,Active,Radial Plan Institutions,,Veterans Affairs National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers,"Battle Mountain Sanitarium (now part of the Veterans Affairs Black Hills Health Care System) was part of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, which provided care for Union veterans after the Civil War.  It was the first and only National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers built solely as a short-term sanitarium for veterans with lung or respiratory problems, not as a long-term home.  Unlike the other National Home branches, veterans went to Battle Mountain Sanitarium for brief intensive treatment. Upon completion of their treatment, they were transferred to another National Home branch. Battle Mountain Sanitarium opened in 1907, offering veterans a complete array of services including plunge baths and an amusement hall.  Located in the town of Hot Springs, South Dakota, the Sanitarium, made from local pink sandstone, rises above the town on a bluff to the northeast of the resort section of the town at an elevation of 3400 feet.  A majority of the buildings predate 1930, and many of them are still used for their original purposes.  The curving road system that winds through the facility is also original.  The National Cemetery is located in the eastern section of the campus.
Founded in the 1880s as a warm water mineral springs health resort, the town of Hot Springs became a popular destination for regional health seekers by 1900.  Tourists enjoyed the benefits of the waters and the mountain scenery.  The local effort to build a National Home branch began in the 1890s.  The possibility became likely after an inspector for the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers inspected a State Soldier’s Home in the area and stated that he was impressed with the therapeutic qualities of the water.  After this, 30 veterans from the Western Branch went to the State facility, and the treatments improved their health.  In 1898, the Grand Army of the Republic formed a committee to convince Congress to locate a National Home branch in Hot Springs.  In 1902, Congress passed legislation authorizing the new facility; the bill allocated $150,000 for the construction of buildings and $20,000 for equipment.  Battle Mountain Sanitarium opened in 1907 for its first patient, Charles Wilbert, from the Marion Branch.
Since the Sanitarium was not a long term residential facility, veterans only stayed as long as they benefited from the treatment.  The Sanitarium treatment options included bathing in or drinking the mineral waters. This treatment particularly helped veterans with musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory conditions and skin diseases.  Once cured, or no longer improving, the patients went back to their residential branch.  Between 1908 and 1909, 865 Civil War and Spanish American War veterans received treatment at the facility.  While the treatments were beneficial, inspectors complained that the facility was too isolated and difficult for veterans to reach; the trip was especially strenuous for very ill men.  By World War I, tuberculosis treatment became the primary focus of the Sanitarium.
Thomas Rogers Kimball of Omaha designed the original buildings at Battle Mountain Sanitarium in a Mission/Spanish Colonial Revival style using local sandstone.  The facility was also inspired by the Romanesque Revival style that was prominent in the town of Hot Springs.  George E. Kessler designed the landscape of the campus.  In 1915, the construction of 204 pink sandstone stairs, referred to as the Grand Staircase, connected the resort district of Hot Springs to the Battle Mountain Sanitarium.  The campus remains largely intact and unaltered from when it was a National Home branch with the addition of only a few new buildings.
The original building complex from 1907 is in the radial or panoptical hospital design.  Kimball designed the buildings in a circular arrangement with the wards projecting out like spokes on a wheel.  An inner circular arcade connects the wards and service buildings.  The center of the circle is an open courtyard with a fountain.  This design allowed for the separation of patients based on the type of disease they had, to avoid contagion.  Kimball placed a service tunnel under an arcade for utilities and a tram for food distribution.  To make cleaning easier, all of the angles in the building were rounded off.  This radial complex connects 11 buildings: the Administration Building (Building 1), Mess Hall (Building 2), Hospital Wards (Buildings 3-8), Plunge Bath (Building 9), Maintenance/Engineering Building (Building 10), and the Library/Auditorium (Building 11), a 1911 addition.  Most of these buildings still serve their original functions.
Just south of the main hospital complex is the residential section.  Kimball designed residential quarters for the staff living on the campus in a Colonial Revival style with some Tudor details.  These include the Governor (Building 23), Chief Engineer (Building 24), Treasurer (Building 25), and Quartermaster’s Quarters (Building 26).  The Chaplains Quarters (Building 27), in a Neoclassical style, dates from 1910.  These buildings are still used as residences today.  Also from 1910 is the Neoclassical Nurses Quarters (Building 20), now used as a day care center.
Post World War I growth led to a building campaign in the 1920s to construct more staff residences.  Neoclassical Duplex Quarters (Buildings 28 and 29) date from 1920 and 1927; one is still used as staff residences and the other as transitional rehabilitation housing. The 1926 Neoclassical nurses’ quarters (Building 21) have been used as apartments for employees since the 1950's.
Because of the influx of veterans with tuberculosis, the increasing need for space led to construction of the Main Hospital (Building 12) in 1926 to the east of the original building complex. The number of veterans at the Sanitarium grew as veterans who were not members of another National Home branch became eligible for tuberculosis treatment at the Sanitarium.  Other historic buildings on the campus include a Conservatory (Building 16), Stable/Carriage House (Building 17), Bandstand (Building 19), and Root Cellar (Building 35). The Conservatory (Building 16) is the sole survivor of its kind from the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers era.
The cemetery at Battle Mountain Sanitarium dates from 1907 and became a national cemetery in 1973. The cemetery has several monuments in it.  Dedicated in 1914, the Battle Mountain Monument is a 32-foot tall obelisk tower situated on the cemetery’s highest point. The inscription on the monument reads “National Home, Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Battle Mountain Sanitarium, 1914” “In Memory of the Men Who Offered Their Lives in the Defense of Their Country.”  The Squire Monument is a granite block memorial erected in 1940 to honor Army Chaplain Guy P. Squire. He served in the Spanish American War and World War I, and later served as chaplain at the Hot Springs VA Medical Facility.  The Veterans of Foreign Wars, District 10, erected the monument.  The cemetery is currently closed to additional internments.[1]

South Dakota,Sioux Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Sioux_Sanitarium,,1898.0,"1899, (boarding school) 1939, (sanitarium).",Active,Cottage Plan,,Rapid City Indian School | Sioux Sanitorium | School of the Hills | Sioux San Hospital | Rapid City Indian Health Service Hospital (current),"Built in 1898, the building first served as one of twenty eight boarding schools for Native Americans in the country. It was known as the Rapid City Indian School or School of the Hills. The school was part of the government’s plan to turn the people they perceived as uneducated savages, into civilized people. People from the Sioux, Cheyenne, Shoshone, Arapaho, Crow, and Flathead tribes were put in the school to be indoctrinated into the white man’s way of life. During thirty-five years of its history between 1898 and 1933, the Rapid City Indian School educated children in fourth through eight grades with occasional acceptances of students from lower grades, and in 1917, it extended its curriculum to the tenth grade. With their time regulated by bells and steam whistles, students at Rapid City spent half a day on academic learning and the other half on vocational training. Superintendent Jesse F. House (1904-22) had observed that proximity to the Rapid City public high school, the South Dakota School of Mines, and the Business College provided Indian students with a better educational environment at the Rapid City Indian School than at other Indian schools. Nevertheless, by 1920, the school had to end the practice of sending its graduates to these finer institutions because the students at Rapid City spent much of their time on vocational instruction ""to keep the school running,"" and they could not master the academic subjects essential to pursuing a higher education The Rapid City Indian School was not an academically sophisticated institution and rarely produced well-educated or even vocationally well-trained students. The school did not fulfill the assimilation goals of the federal government. The Rapid City Indian School closed in 1933.
The school sat in limbo and a transitional period from 1933 to 1939, during which the school’s main building burned and was replaced with the huge building currently occupying the site. In 1939 the Sioux Sanitarium was opened at the location. The facility was created to treat Native Americans with tuberculosis. The building was then converted into a massive hospital called the Sioux Sanitarium for Native American TB patients in 1939.  These years were the darkest in the institution's history. With no cure in sight, the doctors could only do experimental procedures such as removing organs to try and combat the disease. After the patenting of streptomycin, the hospital closed in the 1960s.
The building remained empty for many years until it was converted into a public hospital and named the Sioux San Hospital (derived from Sioux Sanitarium). The hospital still has numerous, unmarked graves around the campus; not only from the TB patients, but also from the Indian children. It has currently been renovated into a public hospital. Recently, reports have got out that the city plans to demolish the old and run down buildings to make way for state of the art medical buildings. As the buildings are so historical, debate was sparked almost instantly. Despite this, construction officials say the construction is years away, possibly even a decade. Nevertheless, many preservationists are trying to get Sioux San on the NRHP.","1933, (boarding school) mid 1960s, (sanitarium).","Rapid City, SD",,,1939,1960,,,,0
