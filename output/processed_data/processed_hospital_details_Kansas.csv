Kansas,Kansas Hospital for the Dangerous Insane,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kansas_Hospital_for_the_Dangerous_Insane,1908.0,,1912,Demolished,Single Building,,Lansing State Hospital for Criminally Insane,"Operated at the Kansas State Penitentiary (now Lansing Correctional Facility) due to problems from state hospitals with escapes and assaults by those found to be ""criminally insane"". A separate wing was constructed in 1911, demolished at an unknown date. In 1939 49 inmates were transferred to a new facility at Larned State Hospital to house them.

Kansas,Kansas Neurological Institute,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kansas_Neurological_Institute,,1942.0,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Winter Veteran's Hospital,"In the late 1950s the need for more centers for people with intellectual disabilities (at that time referred to as ""mental retardation"") became a concern for the Division of Institutional Management, the governing entity. Like many other states Kansas operated several institutions. The other state institutions providing care to people with intellectual disabilities were overcrowded, with each carrying a waiting list for admissions.
At approximately the same time, the Veterans Administration moved from the site of Kansas Neurological Institute (KNI) to a new hospital directly west of their former site. The Division of Institutional Management conceived the idea of acquiring the old buildings due to their availability and their proximity to other resources located in and around Topeka. KNI was created in response to a legislative mandate to provide for ""the evaluation, treatment and care of the mentally retarded, training of personnel and for research into causes and prevention and proper methods of treatment and training of mentally retarded children.""
In July 1959 the land and buildings were transferred to the state of Kansas and restoration of the buildings began. The restoration toward a functional residential hospital was a monumental task. The original structures had been built as the Winter VA Hospital in 120 days during 1942; they were to last a maximum of five years but had been utilized for eighteen years prior to the state acquiring the grounds. The property had been completely abandoned and without heat for a year, leaving floors to loosen, foundations to shift, and buried utility lines to deteriorate further. A goal was set for all of the buildings to be replaced within twenty years.
On January 5, 1960, KNI opened the doors for the admission of its first six residents. Many people admitted during the first year had been waiting for institutional care for several years. By November 1960 approximately 200 people had been admitted. At that time the institutional field held that not much could be done for people with intellectual disabilities, so not much was done. However, that philosophy soon changed. Dr. Clement C. Vickery, KNI's original superintendent, began noting the gains in development many of the children were making. Greater emphasis began being placed on teaching and on providing a supportive climate. In a budget justification, Vickery wrote, "". . . the child's total needs must be met. His greatest needs start with a proper environment.""
In the early days KNI operated on a medical model of service delivery. The medical community drove the processes being utilized at KNI. Psychiatric aides delivered many of the therapies and programs under the direction of the nursing department. Since the people being served were all children, and because of the medical orientation, the supports looked much different from those of today.
The physical structure of KNI moved ahead with the change in treatment focus. A new power plant was constructed in 1965. Following a setback with the 1966 tornado, construction on the first new residential building began in 1969. Sunflower Lodge was operational and serving nearly 100 people in early 1970. For the first time since KNI opened, some of the people were living in new homes as opposed to the old ramp structures from World War II. During the same year came an annual review process for people's programs. The wheelchair modification program and Work Activity Center were under way. The 1970s also saw national movement toward standards of service for institutions brought on by litigation involving institutional populations. A greater focus began being placed on care, dignity, basic human rights, and legal rights. Federal regulations governing intermediate care facilities arose in the mid-1970s. Development and Training Specialists began providing direct support to the people living at KNI, replacing the Psychiatric Aides of the early years.
KNI's population grew quickly. By 1963 there were 325 children living in the institution. By 1971 the census had grown to around 450. The focus of treatment evolved as well. In 1969 a shift was made from the medical model to a program of active goal-directed treatment, education, and habilitation which could lead to eventual placement outside the institution. With the advent of the ""treatment team,"" treatment began shifting from a ward-centered living program to a developmental model.
Meadowlark Lodge was completed in 1972, and Cottonwood Lodge followed in 1973. Now, nearly 300 people were living in new residential units. KNI began being recognized as a developmental disabilities resource center, providing diagnostic evaluations and recommendations for the most appropriate placements for people with intellectual disabilities. Short-term respite services were also being offered. During the 1970s KNI's population began changing. Originally established to provide services to children, KNI saw many people remaining institutionalized past their school years. So, in the 70s, services were expanded to include adults.
Pleasantview was opened as the main dining facility in 1974. Flint Hills Lodge opened in 1975. Honey Bee Lodge, including areas for medical services, opened in 1979. Finally, all people living at KNI were moved out of the old ramp structures into newer, more modern, and better-suited living areas. Many old buildings were torn down as people moved their homes into the new structures. The number of people receiving supports stayed fairly constant, between 380 and 450, through the 1970s and into the early 1980s. Wheatland Center was operational in 1981. It housed administrative services, many adjunctive services, staff training, and the special purpose school. With the opening of Wheatland, the rest of the ramp structures could be razed.
Throughout the early 1980s, the census of KNI remained consistent with that of the 1970s. At the same time, staffing numbers were increasing. A sharp increase in staffing was realized from 1984-91. The greater ratio of staff to people living at KNI was realized and supports grew with better staffing. KNI began being recognized as a regional resource center for northeast Kansas with diagnostic evaluations, continued respite services, and other technical assistance. Toward the end of the 1980s, these services were expanded to include consultations in the community with the goal of keeping people in their home communities near their families. Funding started to become available for additional community resources providing a greater array of services and supports. Consequently, admissions to KNI started dropping off, and early in the 1990s they were kept to a minimum. With scaled-back admissions and out-movement of people from the institution, the number of people being supported started to decrease. The average age of people being served in the 1980s continued to go up such that the majority of those receiving support were adults.
The 1990s saw the introduction of person-centered supports, still better staffing ratios, self-directed work teams, and further reductions in the number of people living at KNI. By 1993 approximately 300 people were receiving the support of the institution. Many homes at KNI began processes of remodeling. Fewer and fewer people were needing to go to the central dining facility as a result of fully functioning kitchens being constructed in the homes. The focus of supports centered around fewer people in each home, more choice, expanded opportunities for productivity and independence, and efforts to promote more inclusionary activities. The efforts began being guided by self-directed work teams of direct supporters with utilization of adjunctive services as needed by each individual.
In October 2007, KNI has a census of 163 people. Efforts continue to help people who experience developmental disabilities live a life of personal growth and well-being. Additionally, KNI functions as a leader and resource to community agencies and people with intellectual disabilities throughout the state of Kansas. Adaptive technologies, mobility assistance, behavioral consultation, advocacy, and staff training are but a few of the broad array of services KNI provides to the people of Kansas. The staff of the Kansas Neurological Institute hold values consistent with the continuation as a leader in the Midwest, forging ahead in helping people realize life-enhancing choice, valued relationships, productivity, independence, respect, full inclusion, and individuality.[1]

Kansas,Larned State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Larned_State_Hospital,1912.0,1913.0,1914,Active,Cottage Plan,C.H. Chandler,Larned State Hospital for the Criminally Insane | Larned Correctional Mental Health Facility,"Larned State Hospital was first opened on April 17th, 1914.  The hospital was opened to ease overcrowding in two other established state hospitals in Kansas which were located in the eastern part of the state, Osawatomie State Hospital and Topeka State Hospital. The new ‘insane asylum’ at Larned was a preferred location because of the plentiful water supply.  ‘Useful employment’ (farming) was the method of treatment to be used at LSH. In fact, early criteria critical to the selection of the first patients to populate the new hospital were being male, possessing the ability to work on the farm and being diagnosed as never becoming well enough to be discharged. No female patients were admitted until 1916. In an effort to ease the overcrowding, an annex was opened at the Army Air Force base in Great Bend which housed approximately 300 patients in 1947. The unit was designed to exclusively deal with elderly and custodial patients.The farming operation continued until the 1950’s. Adolescents and children were not admitted until the late 1960’s and early 1970’s.
The Adult Treatment Center building opened in 1990 to house the general psychiatric population on what is now called the Psychiatric Services Program, serving individuals admitted from the LSH catchment area as a voluntary or civilly committed patients.
The State Security Program (SSP) which was known as the program for the ‘criminally insane’ was first opened at LSH in March 27, 1939. The SSP, originally opened March 27, 1939, to house the criminally insane, opened on the Dillon building, with the transfer of 100 patients from Lansing State Prison. The SSP is housed in the Isaac Ray building and currently serves 170 patients on six units. During 2016, a reduction of 60 State Security Program beds occurred in two phases, June 10, 2016 (South 2 unit), and South 3 was closed April 26, 2016. Patients from those two units were returned to the KDOC where they are currently housed at a cost of $40.00 per day.
The Sexual Predator Treatment Program (SPTP) was first opened at Larned in 1994. It is primarily housed on the Dillon Building (4 units). Additionally, one 20 bed unit
is on the Isaac Ray Building and two units are on Jung Building. A transitional housing unit is housed on the Meyer Building.

Haskell,Kansas Insane Asylum  | Rainbow Mental Health Facility (Current),"Transcribed from volume II of Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history, embracing events, institutions, industries, counties, cities, towns, prominent persons, etc. ... / with a supplementary volume devoted to selected personal history and reminiscence. Standard Pub. Co. Chicago : 1912. 3 v. in 4. : front., ill., ports.; 28 cm. Vols. I-II edited by Frank W. Blackmar. Transcribed July 2002 by Carolyn Ward.
Osawatomie State Hospital The first territorial legislature in 1855 passed an act providing for the appointment of guardians for persons of unsound mind, and in 1859 the provisions of the law were extended to include habitual drunkards. Guardians of such persons were required to assume the management of any estate owned by the ward, and to report to the proper judicial authorities at stated times. The first step toward the erection of an asylum for the insane of Kansas was the passage of the act of March 2, 1863, naming William Chestnut of Miami county, I. Hiner of Anderson county, and James Hanway of Franklin county as commissioners ""to determine the location of the State Insane Asylum of the State of Kansas."" The commissioners were somewhat restricted in the selection of a site, the act confining them to ""some point within the township of Osawatomie township, in the county of Miami."" It was further provided that a tract of land, not less than 160 acres, should constitute the site of the proposed institution, and that title to this land should be secured by donation. No appropriation was made for the erection of buildings until after the location was selected and approved.
On Oct. 17, 1863, the commissioners reported as follows: ""We, the undersigned appointed commissioners to locate the state insane asylum, met at Osawatomie, Kan., on the 7th day of October, A. D., 1863, and selected the southeast quarter of section 2, township 18, range 22, for the reason that this was the only eligible site where a proper title could be obtained with the means at command of the township, and other material advantages for the establishment of such an institution.""
The tract of land selected by the commissioners is situated about a mile north of the city of Osawatomie, on the opposite side of the Marais des Cygnes river. It was donated by the people of Osawatomie township and some years later an additional 160 acres were purchased by the state, giving the hospital a full half section of land. The work of the commissioners was approved, and on Feb. 14, 1865, an act was passed providing for the appointment of three trustees by the governor, only one of whom could be a resident of Miami county. The first building was erected in 1860. It was a small two-story frame structure and cost about $500. Toward the latter part of the year the institution was opened for the reception of patients, with Dr. C. O. Gause as superintendent and Mrs. Gause as matron.
In 1868, the Kansas legislature appropriated funds for a permanent treatment structure to replace all of the existing structures on the asylum grounds. State architect J.G. Haskell presented plans drawn according to the recommended design by Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride of Pennsylvania. The center of the building had twin turrets for administrative offices with extended wings offset right and left for patients. The wings were placed so that fresh air could reach them from both sides. As the 1868 Kirkbride plan for new buildings progressed over the next 18 years, the need for additional patient space presented a continual problem for the asylum.
The years 1892 and 1895 saw the addition of two detached buildings, the Knapp and Adair buildings. The Knapp building, named for former superintendent Abram H. Knapp, was completed in 1892 and housed 300 ""chronic"" or ""incurable"" male patients (the Knapp building was closed in the 1960’s). Abram H. Knapp served as superintendent from 1873-1877 and again from 1878-1892. His tenure as superintendent was considered stormy and tempestuous. Knapp was a controversial figure from the start, two months after he assumed authority as superintendent, a number of asylum employees protested against the ""new and more rigid form of administration"" by marching off in what was considered a ""mutiny.""
In 1895 the Adair building was added to accommodate 300 of the ""chronic"" or ""incurable"" female patients. This new building was named for Reverend Samuel L. Adair, a key figure in the asylum's early establishment (original 1895 Adair building was closed in 1963 and a new Adair complex of multiple buildings was opened in 1963). In 1868 when the state of Kansas decided to establish a permanent structure, Samuel Adair and his son Charles contributed or sold nearly 50 acres of land to help the state establish the asylum. Reverend Samuel L. Adair was a congregational minister who established the first church in the town of Osawatomie. He also served as Secretary on the asylum's board of trustees and was chaplain at the asylum.
By 1900 the asylum had expanded from its original 170 acres in 1866-1868 to 720 acres. Additional buildings included the main administration building which held offices, a chapel, dormitories for employees, east and went wings for patients, shops, a boiler house, electric light and power plant, ice house, bakery, laundry, barns, green houses, and a reservoir for water supply.
In 1910 the property held by the hospital was valued at $1,000,000. The farm has been increased to 720 acres; a main building includes the administration offices, the chapel, which seats 600 people, dormitories for a large number of the employees, and quarters for about 450 patients; the Knapp and Adair buildings, similar in design and equipment, each accommodate 300 chronic cases, the former being set apart for men and the latter for women; and there are shops, boiler house, electric light and power plant, ice house, bakery, laundry, barns, green houses, a reservoir for a water supply, etc. In 1901 a new infirmary was erected at a cost of $50,000, and since then the institution has been supplied with a tuberculosis pavilion. The original building of 1866 was removed to the rear of the east wing of the main building, where it is now used as a residence for the head farmer and is known as ""The Lodge."" There is also an amusement hall.
Additional buildings were added over the years and by the turn of the century it included dormitories for employees, shops, an electric power plant, ice house, bakery, laundry, barns, greenhouses and a reservoir. In 1912, it could serve more than 1,000 patients. My the mid 20th Century, newspapers began to run report on the deplorable conditions of of state run hospitals which included neglect, brutality, overcrowded facilities, and the use of restraints. Soon, the Governor and the legislature acted and reform began that included new facilities and training programs for staff.
A “rehabilitation center,” which included a swimming pool, well-equipped auditorium, and a modern gymnasium were completed in 1963. In 1971 the original Kirkbride building east and west wings were demolished, the administration building was razed in 2002, but several other historic buildings continue to stand. On the outskirts of the property sits a sad little cemetery, where no names are contained on the tombstones -- only numbers. The hospital is much smaller today, serving only 176 patients.[1]

Kansas,Topeka State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Topeka_State_Hospital,1875.0,1877.0,1879,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,,Topeka Insane Asylum,"Legislature appropriated $25,000 in 1875 ""for the purpose of building an asylum for the insane at some convenient and healthy spot within two miles of the state capitol building in the city of Topeka."" One condition was that the land would be acquired at no cost to the state. So the city of Topeka and Shawnee County each contributed $6,000 to purchase the original 80 acres.
The first two ward buildings, accommodating 135 patients, opened in 1872. Dr. Barnard Douglass Eastman resigned as superintendent of the asylum at Worcester MA to become the first superintendent at TSH. The institution was called the Topeka Insane Asylum until 1901 when the Legislature officially changed the name to Topeka State Hospital. Eastman told legislators that patients who were being released to make room for more patients were ""well enough to be in a measure useful. All were of a quiet and harmless character.""
He described the treatment process this way: ""Removal from the worriment, the overwork, the unsanitary conditions and the unsuitable food of many homes ... occupying body and mind in the new employment, cheering the drooping and melancholy and soothing the excited and irritable, are some of the elements of treatment of the greatest value, sometimes working rapid cures with but little medication.""
Patients who were able did useful work around the asylum during the day, constructing new buildings, working on the farm or sewing. Patients were admitted to the asylum only by court order. Eastman objected to such demeaning insanity trials, saying ""The insane are sick, not criminal."" But the policy didn't change until 1919. The Legislature allowed shell-shocked veterans of World War I to be treated at TSH without the indignity of an insanity trial.
An alarm arose in 1948 over the deplorable conditions at TSH, caused by such factors as reduced expenditures by the state and a shortage of psychiatrists, psychologists and other professional personnel. Legal commitment papers couldn't be found for some of the patients, and some patients couldn't even be accurately identified. Many patients still were being admitted as a result of the legal process and weren't having their actual mental conditions evaluated by hospital officials. Patients were sometimes kept chained and nude for months or even years.
Gov. Frank Carlson appointed a five-member panel to study the situation. After the committee released its report in October 1948, the Legislature doubled the appropriations for mental hospitals, made TSH a training center for psychiatric personnel and implemented other changes. The practice of placing patients in rocking chairs in the hallways during the daytime was discontinued. Incidents of patient mistreatment were investigated and corrected. Psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation volunteered some of their own time to examine patients, and Menninger psychologists helped organize a department of psychology at TSH.
In 1949, the first social worker was hired. She began the first discharge plans for patients who were deemed ready for release. Social workers and volunteers often had to acquaint patients with modern household appliances that didn't exist when they were admitted.
Patients first were able to receive outpatient treatment at TSH in 1951. In subsequent years, the professional staff was increased, including physicians and dentists to treat physical ailments. In 1951, a fully equipped operating room was created. Conditions began to deteriorate again about 1958 because of state funding cutbacks. Staff salaries fell seriously behind salaries offered elsewhere, and experienced staff members were leaving. The good news was that the use of tranquilizing drugs was proving effective on a large percentage of the patients.
By 1968, TSH was back at the leading edge again, at least in terms of how to run a mental hospital. An organization plan, called ""The Kansas Plan,"" was being used as a model for organizing other institutions around the country. It included treatment, research, training and consultation to the communities it served.
But in 1988, the hospital lost its accreditation to receive federal Medicare and Medicaid payments. By the 1990s, the mental health movement was away from the hospital model and toward community-based programs. Partly because the community-based model appeared effective and partly because it was cheaper, the Kansas Legislature decided to close one of its three mental hospitals. TSH was chosen for closing and went out of business May 17, 1997.
On June 1, 2010 demolition began on the center building.

Kansas,Winfield State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Winfield_State_Hospital,,1888.0,,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Kansas State Asylum for Idiotic and Imbecile Youth | Kansas State Imbecile Asylum | Winfield State Hospital and Training Center | Winfield Correctional Facility,"The Winfield State Hospital opened initially in 1881 on the University of Kansas campus but soon relocated to the town of Winfield in 1887, receiving the name change ""The Kansas State Asylum for Idiotic and Imbecile Youth"" and had thirty-one students (Seaton, p. 252). The new location, further away from the more public University of Kansas central campus, allowed for the Asylum to become more self sufficient, using the young students as an indentured work force, raising vegetables, meat, grain, having its own water, and even putting out its own fires instead of relying on the public fire departments (Seaton, p.  252).
On July 1, 1893, Dr. F. Hoyt Pilcher was named the superintedent of the Asylum, after an increase in the number of students. This is the point at which the eugenics movement began to have a greater influence on the Winfield Institute with the Progressive movement. In this state home Pilcher “de-sexed” his patients (Paul, p. 617), no longer focusing on simply keeping the ""feeble-minded"" in the institution, but sterilizing them so that, in the event that they left the institution, they would not enter society sexually. The number of students at the Institute began to grow at an exponential rate. ""In 1900 it was 173, and in 1910 it was 419. By 1916 it was 589"" (Seaton, p. 253).
In 1909 the name changed to the State Home for the Feeble-Minded, after many of the epileptics in the institution had been sent to the newly founded Parsons Institute which attempted to use newly discovered medical treatments for epilepsy.
It is important to note that the original emphasis of the Winfield Institute was education, training those at the Institute to live in society. By the 1920s, however, the emphasis was placed on agricultural productivity as both the male and female clients were put to work throughout the institution, so that it could become its own system. no longer training the students to live in society, but training them to live in their own self-created world.  By 1933 it was called a “custodial institution for the helpless” and the emphasis was on discipline, cost-cutting, and farm productivity, which included a name change again in 1930 to the State Training School.  . At this time, further sterilizations occurred (Seaton, p. 254).  The population at Winfield peaked during WWII when it reached 1,245 clients in 1942 (Seaton, p. 254).
After WWII, Kansas hospitals for the disabled were assessed and several problems were found at Winfield.  Although there were not recorded accounts of physical abuse, handcuffs, leg irons, and whips were found in the hospital and in February 1987, 14 employees were fired and 13 were suspended after claims of client abuse in the men’s wards (Seaton, p. 257).  In 1991, after a long history of turmoil at Winfield, the governmental process of closing the hospital’s doors began.  It was part of a movement fostered by the idea that the developmentally disabled had civil rights that should be protected.  Finally, in March 1998, after much debate, Winfield closed its doors,  and it is now a correctional facility (Seaton, p. 261; Kansas Department of Corrections).  The hospital’s closing seems long coming, as throughout Winfield’s 116-year existence, it continuously suffered from “an uncertain mission, a troubled relationship with the state and the community, and overcrowding due to almost nonexistent admission policies” (Seaton, p. 263).  Today, three community-based programs serve more than 250 clients in Cowley County, and more than 100 of them came from Winfield.

Kansas,Kansas State Industrial School for Girls,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kansas_State_Industrial_School_for_Girls,,,1889,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Beloit Juvenile Correctional Facility,"The Women's Christian Temperance Union established the school in 1889 and it was later acquired by the state. The purpose of the school was to reform economically or socially disadvantaged girls between twelve and sixteen years old. The school taught sewing, weaving, cooking, gardening and horticulture, wood carving, clay modeling, and the general duties of the household. The film showcases the following programs and activities: healthcare and hospital, housework, laundry, sewing, bakery, cooking, religious instruction, student government, dancing, table tennis, roller skating, Independence Day parade, flag drill, folk dance, track and field, and patriotic instruction.
The most infamous superintendent was Lula Coyner, whose cruelty caused the girls to march to the sheriff’s office and demand an investigation. In 1935 and 1936, Coyner undertook a campaign of forced sterilization after becoming enamored with an international movement known as eugenics, a philosophy also popular among the Nazis that sought to prevent those deemed mentally disabled or otherwise genetically inferior from having children. During her tenure, 62 girls — almost half of her charges — were transported about 175 miles away to the Women’s Prison Hospital in Lansing to have their fallopian tubes removed.The reason: Coyner wrote in a 1936 report that girls who “asked to be sterilized” had “serious physical or family handicaps,” such as venereal diseases, insanity, epilepsy and illegitimacy. She later defended her action, writing that it was “the finest service to society the Girls’ Industrial School has ever contributed.” A torrent of negative news stories presented it differently, and Coyner’s replacement, Blanche Peterson, told a reporter girls lived in terror of the operations, which were performed for “absurd” reasons.
Beloit became a training ground for workers from the Topeka-based Menninger Clinic, which became known internationally for humanizing treatment of the mentally ill. The therapy provided a means for the girls to finally talk openly about the abuse many of them had experienced. There was usually at least one young murderess at Beloit, generally sent there for killing an abuser.
The environment began to change because of a federal law passed in the mid-1970s that sought to end the incarceration of status offenders — those whose offenses wouldn’t be a crime if committed by an adult. The practice wasn’t fully eliminated in Kansas until 1983. Over the past decade, more low-level offenders were placed in less-expensive and, research suggests, more appropriate community-based programs.
The Beloit facility averaged just 21 girls in the just-ended 2009 fiscal year, down from 103 in 1999; because of the low numbers, the state was spending an average of $200,000 a year on each girl. In the midst of a deep recession that has caused massive budget cuts in Kansas, like most other places, the expenses for Beloit became just too high. After more than 120 years, it closed in August.

Kansas,Kansas State Reform School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kansas_State_Reform_School,1879.0,,1881,Active,Cottage Plan,,Industrial School for Boys | Youth Center at Topeka | Topeka Juvenile Correctional Facility,"The Kansas State Reform School, also known as the Industrial School for Boys, was established in 1879 by a legislative act that appropriated $35,000 for the erection of buildings, etc., in Topeka, Kansas. Control and supervision of the school was placed in the hands of the Board of Trustees of Charitable Institutions. The school was located 3 miles north of the capitol building on an original tract of 170 acres that was given by the city of Topeka. The west wing of the main building was opened on June 1, 1881. The school taught boys the rudiments of useful employment as a means of supporting themselves after being discharged from the facility. The boys learned, among other things, tailoring, shoe and harness making, woodworking of various kinds, baking, and printing.
In 1971, younger offenders who had been adjudicated delinquent or miscreant were transferred to the Atchison facility. In 1974, the name of the institution was changed to the Youth Center at Topeka. The former name, Topeka Juvenile Correctional Facility, was established during the 1997 Legislative Session. On July 1, 1997, responsibility for the juvenile correctional facilities in Kansas was transferred from the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services to the Juvenile Justice Authority. In the spring of 2005 operations of Topeka Juvenile Correctional Facility and the new Kansas Juvenile Correctional Complex were merged under the Kansas Juvenile Correctional Complex name.",,"Topeka, KS",,,1881.0,,,,,1

It is this legacy that would ultimately become Villa St. Francis.  In an effort to better meet the needs of over 300 diocesan faithful on their waitlist, the community expanded by relocating in 1977 and began accepting additional patients for its 205 newly renovated rooms.

Kansas,Menniger Clinic,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Menniger_Clinic,1919.0,,1925,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Society Benefit Association Hospital,"The Menninger Foundation of Topeka, Kansas, began as an outpatient clinic in the 1920s serving the local Shawnee County populace for a variety of ills. Karl Menninger began persuading his father Charles Frederick, or C.F., to focus the clinic's area of expertise on psychiatric and mental health cases. The Menningers opened the first clinic in 1919. In 1925 they purchased a farmhouse on the outskirts of town to for a sanitarium to provide long-term in-patient care. William Claire Menninger, Karl's youngest brother, joined Karl and their father in this practice that same year, fulfilling C.F.’s dream of a group practice with his sons.
The sanitarium began expanding almost immediately. The Menninger family opened other operations, including Southard School for children, one of the first such institutions for children with mental health disabilities. The family also began training psychiatric professionals and performing research, as well as publishing in the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic. During the 1930s Will and other Menninger staff formulated and refined their milieu therapy, a treatment program focusing on the whole individual and every staff member’s interaction with a patient.
Karl became a popularly respected and well-known figure in psychiatry after the publication of his first book in 1930 and writing a regular advice column in the Ladies’ Home Journal. Will, like many other Menninger staff, joined the armed forces during World War II; by the end of the war he was a brigadier general and extremely influential in the treatment and care of soldiers with psychiatric problems.
As grant monies became more important for funding various efforts, the Menninger family created a non-profit foundation through which such monies could be funneled more easily. Within a few years this foundation became the central organizational entity for all its efforts, and by 1946 all branches of Menninger's efforts were under the foundation. This included Southard School, which became the children's division of the clinic.
Other efforts were formalized after World War II, including the research department and the education department of Menninger School of Psychiatry. Later renamed the Karl Menninger School of Psychiatry and Mental Health Services, the school established itself post-World War II when Karl persuaded the federal government to convert the Winter army hospital, used during the war as a psychiatric hospital for soldiers, into a veterans administration hospital, giving the Menninger organization an excellent opportunity to graduate large numbers of needed psychiatrists.
The Menninger Clinic, after substantial remodeling and expansion, became the C.F. Menninger Memorial Hospital in 1954, named in the founder’s honor after his death the year before. The Department of Social Applications, renamed the Department of Preventive Psychiatry and later becoming the Will Menninger Center for Applied Behavioral Sciences (CABS), was a later addition to the foundation, focusing on preventive psychiatry and the use of psychiatry in other areas such as law enforcement.
The Menninger Foundation grew, to the point that for a time it existed on two campuses on west 6th Avenue in Topeka, and to the point that it employed more than a thousand people with a budget in the millions. Throughout its existence, treatment, education, research, and public outreach remained paramount for the organization. By the late 1990s, the Menninger Foundation was foundering. Clinical patients, the source of much of the foundation's income, were spending less time in in-house treatment, and health insurance companies were not covering fees the way they once had. By 2003 the foundation dissolved, and the clinic moved south to Houston, Texas, in order to affiliate itself with Baylor Medical College. The Menninger Clinic continues to operate in Texas.[1]

Kansas,Kansas State Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kansas_State_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,1913.0,,1914,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Norton State Sanatorium | Norton State Hospital | Valley Hope Alcohol Treatment Center | Norton Correctional Facility,"The Kansas State Tuberculosis Sanatorium is situated in a beautiful spot on the Prairie Dog Creek four miles east of Norton. The location is ideal for an institution of this character. The air is invigorating, there is an abundance of pure water with a near perfect drainage system. The climate is good, with an abundance of sunshine throughout the year.
The State of Kansas owns an L-shaped tract of land on the northwest corner of the intersection of US 36 and 383 with K-67. This tract comprises 240 acres of good bottom land on which the Sanatorium buildings are situated. The grounds situated in the bend of the creek are appropriately landscaped, with the buildings arranged around the Administration Building, which stands near the center. Pleasing drives and walks leading to the different parts of the grounds with evergreens and flowers at intervals make it very beautiful. The trees skirting the creek to the north make a fitting background for the landscape. The buildings and grounds are brilliantly lighted by night and can be seen for miles.
To the north of the creek are the barns and dairy herd which supply the institution with milk. Chickens are kept to supply the patients with fresh eggs throughout the year. The farm produces feed which is fed from several large silos built for the purpose and belonging to the institution.
The history of the sanatorium dates back to the year 1913. The corner stone was laid and the dedicatory service held on June 14, 1914. The corner stone bears the inscription: ""In the health of the people lies the strength of the nation.""
As an inducement to have the institution located in Norton county, the citizens of Norton subscribed $7,200 to purchase the site. As the institution continued to grow, more land was needed. In the year 1934 the State of Kansas purchased a square tract of land consisting of 160 acres, less the railroad right-of-ways, just north of US 36 and 383 on the northeast corner of the intersection with K-67. This with an additional tract of 3.94 acres east of the buildings, make a total of approximately 400 acres owned by the State of Kansas.

In 1963 the State Sanatorium for Tuberculosis in Norton was authorized to serve persons with mental retardation. It continued this dual duty until 1968, at which point all TB patients were transferred to the institution in Chanute and the sanatorium was renamed Norton State Hospital. It never served direct admissions, only transfers from other institutions.
Norton Correctional Facility (NCF) opened in the buildings of the former Norton State Hospital in 1987. In 1988, NCF’s East Unit opened in the converted farm implement dealership building located in Stockton.
