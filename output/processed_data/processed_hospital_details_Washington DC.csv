Washington DC,Freedmen's Hospital and Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Freedmen%27s_Hospital_and_Asylum,1862.0,,1863/1908,Preserved,Pavilion Plan,,Freedmen's Government Hospital | Freedmen's Hospital | Howard University Hospital (Current),"The Freedmen’s Hospital was founded in 1862 in Washington, DC. It was the first hospital of its kind to aid in the medical treatment of former slaves.  Later it became the major hospital for the African American community in Washington, D.C.  The hospital was founded on the grounds of Camp Barker at 13th and R Streets in Northwest Washington.  It remained in that location until a new building was completed in 1909 at Bryant and 6th Street.   Through much of its history the hospital was managed by the U.S. government.
In 1868, six years after its founding, Freedmen’s Hospital became a teaching hospital for the Howard University Medical School.  One of the first members of the school’s faculty was Lieutenant Colonel Alexander T. Augusta, M.D.   Augusta had been placed in charge of the hospital in 1863 and thus was the first black hospital administrator in U.S. history.  He was also on the faculty for the Howard University medical school along with six  other faculty members,  including Anderson Ruffin Anderson,  another African American.  Augusta remained on the faculty from 1868 to 1877.
Despite federal control, Freedman's Hospital was often touched by scandal between 1872 and 1910.  Every single hospital administrator, whether white or black, was involved in some sort of scandal from misconduct to malpractice. Numerous cases were brought against hospital officials who utilized hospital services for personal gain.  Other administrators  were neglectful and some were  charged with embezzlement.  While the Hospital's leadership was tarnished, the doctors and nurses continued to provide vital treatment to often impoverished District of Columbia residents.   The Freedman's Asylum,    which was connected administratively to the Hospital, provided care for aged and disabled black patients.
Early in the 20th Century the U.S. Congress authorized the construction of a new hospital, which was completed in 1909.  The new 278-bed state-of-the-art facility now attracted able administrators.  Perhaps the most famous was Charles R. Drew, M.D., a surgeon and hospital administrator.  Drew, already nationally famous for his blood plasma research, ran Freedman's Hospital, was a medical professor at Howard University Medical School and chair of the school's Department of Surgery from 1941 to 1950. Under his leadership the surgery department grew in size and reputation.
In 1967 Freedmen’s Hospital  was taken over by Howard University and operated until 1975. A new university hospital opened in 1975 at 2041 Georgia Avenue.  The former building now houses the Howard University College of Nursing and College of Allied Health Sciences.  Howard University continues to manage the facility , which is now called Howard University Hospital.  The Bryant Street building now houses Howard University's John H. Johnson School of Communications. [1]",1975,"Washington, DC",,,1862.0,1975.0,278.0,,,0
Washington DC,St Elizabeths Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St_Elizabeths_Hospital,1852.0,1852.0,1855,Active,Kirkbride Plan,"Thomas U. Walter; Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge",Government Hospital for the Insane | United States Government Hospital for the Insane,"In November of 1852 a tract of land overlooking the Anacostia River  was purchased for $25,000 from Thomas Blagden. Construction began almost immediately on the center building, a red brick fortress designed in Gothic revival style by Thomas U. Walter, who also designed the dome of the Capital Building. The hospital was built following the Kirkbride Plan, most of the construction of the center building was done by slaves.[1] It opened in 1855 as the Government Hospital for the Insane. The Hospital's early mission, as defined by its founder, the leading mental health reformer Dorothea Dix, was to provide the ""most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia."" During the Civil War, wounded soldiers treated here were reluctant to admit that they were in an insane asylum, and said they were at St. Elizabeth's, the colonial name of the land where the Hospital is located. Congress officially changed the Hospital's name to St. Elizabeth's in 1916. By the 1940s, the Hospital complex covering an area of over 300 acres. At its peak, 4,000 people worked and 7,000 patients lived there.[2] It was the first and only federal mental facility with a national scope.
The first appropriation towards building the Government Hospital for the Insane was of $100,000, and was made by Congress in 1852 for the purchase of land.  The organic act creating the institution and outlining the duties of its officers and providing for the admission of various classes of insane patients was not approved until March 3, 1855.  The hospital, however, had been opened for the reception of patients on January 15,1855.
The creation of the hospital was due very largely to the activity of Dorothea L. Dix.  She drew up with her own pen the outlines of the organic act establishing the institution, and virtually named its first superintendent , Dr. C. H. Nicholas.  During the latter part of her life Miss Dix spent much of her time at the hospital, where quarters were always reserved for her, and the little desk upon which she drew up the original act creating the hospital stands in the board room in the main building.
On the first of July, 1855, the President named a board of visitors, as follows: Benjamin F. Bohrer, M. D., president; William W. Corcoran, Jacob Gideon, Professor Grafton Tyler, M. D., Daniel Ratcliff, Professor Thomas Miller, M. D., William Whelan, M. D., U.S.N., Robert C. Wood, M. D., U.S.A., and Rev. P. D. Gurley, D. D.  The make-up of the board has, in the main, followed the plan of the first board, namely, to name as members of the board on representative of each of the classes card for in the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service, usually the acting or the retired surgeon-general of these several services, a lay physician, a lawyer, a clergyman, a layman, and in recent years two women.
The original main building was built from brick made on the place, and in architectural style is a modification of the Kirkbride plan, each wing receding for the center, in echelon.  The building itself is in the collegiate Gothic style.  This main building was several years in building and wings were added to it from time to time.  Other construction, however, was undertaken in the meant time, and shortly after the opening of the hospital, during fiscal year 1855-6, a building was opened for the colored insane, which the superintendent state in his report he believed to be the ""first and only special provision for the suitable care of the African when afflicted with insanity which has yet been made in any part of the world.""
While it was undoubtedly very largely in Miss Dix's mind that the Government Hospital for the Insane should be essentially a military institution, still the organic act provided also for the admission of patients from the District of Columbia.  The District of Columbia in those years, however, was a rather small affair and so the number admitted to the hospital was not very great.  The total number of patients admitted from all sources during the first year was only 63.  During the Civil War, however, the hospital was conveniently located for utilization by the army and navy, and in 1861 on the its buildings, the West Lodge, was set aside for the wounded seamen of the Chesapeake and Potomac fleets, and a little later a couple of wards in the main building were prepared for the reception of sick and wounded soldiers.  The following year the annual report shows that the General and Quarantine Naval Hospitals, with 70 beds, in charge of Surgeon N. Pinkney, of the Navy, and the General Army Hospital, with 250 beds, in charge of the medical officers of the Government Hospital for the Insane, ""have been successful operation during all of the past year""; while in the following year it is again noted that the General Hospital, with 250 beds, known as the St. Elizabeth Hospital, and the separate General and Quarantine Naval Hospitals, with 60 beds in both, ""all free tenants of the institution, under our supervision, are maintained in full activity and usefulness.""
Here is the first mention of the name of St. Elizabeth as applied to the hospital.  It was taken from the name of the tract of land upon which the hospital stood, which has been known ever since the settlement of the country as the St. Elizabeth tract.  The application of the name St. Elizabeth to the hospital was the result of the disinclination of many of the soldiers who were not insane to have the institution in which they were temporarily resident called the Government Hospital for the Insane.  In January of 1863, at the request of the Surgeon-General of the army, certain rooms of the hospital were set aside for the convenience of one of the manufacturers of artificial legs,  and soldiers who had lost a limb by amputation in any one of the district of neighboring hospitals might, if they wished, be transferred to the St. Elizabeth Hospital as soon as the stump was healed, to be fitted with an artificial leg.  These were the men who, while resident in the hospital and getting their artificial limbs adjusted, did not wish to be considered patients in an institution for the insane, and so St. Elizabeth Hospital came to be a name applied to the institution.  The St. Elizabeth referred to is the Hungarian saint about whom many legends of kindness to the sick and afflicted folks were written, and so the name came to be retained because of its singular appropriateness.
Dr. Godding had been appointed upon the hospital staff some time 1863.  He came from Fitchburg, Mass., and previous to hist connection with the Government Hospital for the Insane had been connected with the New Hampshire Hospital for the Insane at Concord.  Later he had been superintendent of the Taunton State Hospital for a number of years and resigned the position to return to Washington.
During Dr. Godding's incumbency of 22 years the institution grew rapidly.  When he took charge of the hospital in 1877 he found only six buildings.  During his superintendency he erected 22 buildings and various extensions and additions.  The larger buildings erected were the Relief Building, the Home Building, Howard Hall for the criminal insane, the Toner Building and Infirmary, a large refectory, the Oaks Building for the epileptic insane, with its large kitchen, a power house with electrical installation, and the Allison Building.  When he took charge there were 765 patients; when he died he left a population of 1967 patients.  He found, in 1877, 227 employees.  He left and organization of 540 employees, or a total of over 2500 patients and attendants.  Besides the erection of these buildings he added over 500 acres to the hospital grounds and established a farm colony at Godding Croft.  During this period of growth the appropriations for the support of the institution trebled, and at the time of his death he was annually disbursing of $500,000.
The Government Hospital for the Insane was one of the early institutions in the country to recognize the value of scientific work and one of the first to appoint a pathologist.  Dr. I. W. Blackburn, who had been associated with Professor Formad of Philadelphia, was appointed special pathologist in the fiscal year 1883-4.  In after his work became well known, and at the time of his death-June 18, 1911-he established for himself a national reputation among workers in his field.
The Government Hospital for the Insane was also one of the first to take up the systematic application of hydrotherapeutic measures to the treatment of the insane.  The active man on the staff in this work was Dr. G. W. Foster, who had charge of the Toner infirmary.  The report for 1895-6 shows that during the previous two years he had been actively engaged in using hydroterapeutic measures and had made special application of the form of treatment to general paresis.  Subsequent reports made considerable mention of this treatment, describing both Dr. Foster's methods and his conclusions.  During the first three years no special hydrotherapeutic apparatus was installed, the treatment consisting mostly of the application of the cold pack accompanied by cold to the head in the form of a wet towel or ice pack.  During the fiscal year 1897-8 a complete hydrotherapeutic outfit was installed, the form of apparatus bearing that designed by Dr. S. Baruch, of New York City.  Dr. Godding died in office on the 6th of May, 1899.
During the interval Dr. Godding's death and the appointment of his successor, Dr. A.H. Whitmer became acting superintendent.  During his short period of service the school of instruction in nursing, which had begun in 1894, was reorganized and extended, and arrangements were made to give a certificate after the completion of a two years' course, with promotion and increase in pay.
Dr. Whitmer died January 18, 1900.
On October 17, 1899, Dr. A.B. Richardson was appointed superintendent as Dr. Godding's successor.  He came from Ohio, where he had much experience as administrator and had recently built the Massillon State Hospital.
When Dr. Richardson took charge of the hospital his survey of the situation showed that the buildings were calculated to accommodate properly and care for a population not to exceed 1600 patients, while the population on June 30, 1900, was 2076, an excess of almost 500 beyond the capacity of the institution.  The superintendent reported that in some of the male wards which were intended for 18 patients there were 43 and 44 patients, and in other wards from 16 to 18 beds were made on the floor each night along the corridors, while in the most disturbed female wards, with a normal capacity of 36 each, there were 58 to 60 patients.  This condition of affairs was reported to Congress, which authorized an extension of the hospital for 1000 patients, and limited the total cost of said extension to $975,000.  Arrangements were immediately made for securing plans and entering upon the work of extension.  After the preliminaries were finally completed a contract was let for the construction of 12 buildings.  The original contract for 12 buildings included two psychopathic reception buildings, on building each for disturbed men and women, an infirmary and six cottages.  Five larger buildings were built to accommodate from 104 to 120 patients each, and the six cottages from 40 to 60 patients each.  The twelfth building was the nurses' home.  In addition to these buildings, a cold storage building and storehouse, a kitchen for the detached group of buildings, and a new stable were constructed, artesian wells bored for supplying the hospital with water, and a railroad switch constructed extending from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad to the power house.  During the following session, in 1902, Congress provided for an additional administration building, a kitchen building, and a central power, heat and lighting plant by an appropriation of $425,000, making a total appropriation for the hospital extension of $1,400,000, to which added afterwards a little of $100,000 for furnishing, etc., completing the sum of $1,500,000 expended for the accommodation of 1000 patients; for centralizing the power, heat and lighting, and for centralized administration, making a per capita cost per patient of somewhere between $1000 and $1500.
In the midst of this work and before and of the buildings of the hospital extension had been completed and occupied, Dr. Richardson, who was apparently in good health, suffered a stroke of apoplexy and died suddenly on the 27th of June, 1903.
He was succeeded by the present incumbent, Dr. William A. White, who took charge of the hospital on October 3, 1903.  During the intervening three months between Dr. Richardson's death and the appointment of the new superintendent, Dr. Maurice J. Stack, first assistant physician, was in charge.
On the first of October, 1903, there were 2293 patients in the hospital, and the 15 buildings of the hospital extension were under construction, but no one of them had been finished.  The work of building this large addition to the institution, reclassifying the population, occupying new buildings, shifting the center of administration and getting the new power, heat and lighting plant in operation immediately devolved upon the incoming superintendent.  The first of the new buildings was placed in commission and occupied on August 12, 1904, and from that time forth various buildings were gradually occupied.  The officers were changed to the new administration building and the central power plant started in operation.
During the last few years of Dr. Godding's life and during the short period of Dr. Richardson's superintendency the hospital had rapidly grown; when the large extension for 1000 beds had been completed and was ready for occupancy the problem of the reclassification of patients to meet the new possibilities of housing required to be solved, and it was suddenly borne in upon the management that the hospital had in some way suddenly expanded form an institution of medium size to a tremendous plant.  Dr. Godding had been many years connected with the institution and knew all of its ramifications so that he had not felt keenly the need for newer administrative methods.  Dr. Richardson was so completely occupied with the great problem of building that he had not time and energy to devote to a revision of administrative methods, and when therefore  the new buildings were to be occupied it became apparent that the whole institution required to be placed upon new administrative basis, and that the psychological moment had arrived for undertaking this extensive work.
With the occupation of the new buildings the population was redistributed and reclassified.  Tubercular patients were segregated from the others, porches and sun parlors being built for their accommodation; epileptic patients were separately housed; and the problem of classification generally was carefully worked out as best it could be under all the circumstances.
Decline began in the 1950s. Massive institutions came to be seen as a problem, not the solution and mental hospitals began to deinstitutionalize patients. The idea was that they could get personalized treatment in community-based facilities and that new psychiatric drugs would allow them near-normal lives. Many patients ended up homeless after leaving the hospital. In 1987, the federal government deeded St. Elizabeths to the District of Columbia to come up with an alternate use. But the District's mental health program was in receivership, and long-range planning was not a high priority. By 1996, the remaining 850 patients had to cope with medicine shortages, a lack of equipment and a heating system that failed so frequently patients went weeks without showers. Life at St. Elizabeths had regressed to a condition disturbingly similar to those that inspired the creation of the hospital in the first place. The last patients were moved from the west campus in 2002. All became quiet in the once-magnificent center building, the ghostly structure slowly succumbing to time and neglect. It was estimated to cost $50 million to $100 million to bring the buildings on the west campus back up to code. The District of Columbia tried several times to sell the hospital, but each time the deal fell through. With no answer in sight, the federal government took over the west campus again in 2004. The General Services Administration began nailing plywood over windows and shoring up roofs until a tenant could be found.
Homeland Security made a pitch to Congress in 2006 for the west campus. They claimed that St. Elizabeths was the only site large enough to allow the agency to consolidate.[3] On March 20, 2007 it was announced that DHS would spend approximately $4.1 billion to move its headquarters and most of its Washington-based offices to a new 4,500,000-square-foot facility on the site, beginning with the United States Coast Guard in 2010. DHS, whose operations are scattered around dozens of buildings in the Washington, D.C. area, hopes to consolidate at least 60 of its facilities at St. Elizabeths and to save $64 million per year in rental costs. DHS also hopes to improve employee morale and unity by having a central location from which to operate. The plans to locate DHS to St. Elizabeths have been met with criticism, however. Historic preservationists argue that the move will destroy dozens of historic buildings located on the campus and that other alternatives should be considered. Community activists have also expressed concern that the planned high-security facility will not be interactive with the community, and will do little to revitalize the economically depressed area. A ceremonial groundbreaking for the DHS consolidated headquarters took place at St. Elizabeths on September 9, 2009. The event was attended by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, DC Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC Mayor Adrian Fenty, and acting GSA Administrator Paul Prouty. In 2005, the Hospital celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding and honored members of the Armed Forces who became mentally ill while serving their country.[4]
The western campus of St. Elizabeth's contains many historical buildings, including the original 1850s Kirkbride style center building, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990. There is also a Civil War cemetery where 300 Union and Confederate soldiers who died here are buried. The Hospital complex is located on a hill in southeast Washington, overlooking the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. In 1987, the federal government transferred the hospital operations and the east hospital campus to the DC Department of Mental Health, while retaining ownership of the western campus.
The eastern campus contains many newer buildings, built during the 20th century. This include many smaller two story pavilion style buildings and other large 5+ story buildings. The east campus is still an active medical center, owned by the DC Department of Mental Health. Construction began in 2006 on a new 450,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility to replace the 150-year old Hospital. The new hospital incorporates the best practices in modern, in patient mental health care with an environmentally sensitive design and sustainable strategies. The new building’s therapeutic design includes bright and airy living and treatment areas, green spaces off each patient unit, and enclosed courtyards. A 28,000 square-foot green roof is likely the largest on any psychiatric facility in the country. The new hospital was completed in November of 2009.[5]

The following short documentary video was created by St. Elizabeths hospital that documents the institution's history.
The West Campus Cemetery was originally established for ""friendless patients"" who were to be interred ""without ceremony"", according to Dr. Nichols in a letter to the Secretary of the Interior. Researched records indicate the cemetery has approximately 300 military graves (of which less than 200 are marked with a headstone) and approximately 160 civilian graves (none of which are marked with a headstone). White and African American soldiers from the Union army and soldiers of the Confederacy are interspersed throughout this cemetery. The graves are located on a hill near I-295 and overlook the Potomac River and Washington, DC.

Washington DC,Gallinger Municipal Hospital Psychopathic Ward,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Gallinger_Municipal_Hospital_Psychopathic_Ward,,1920.0,1923,Demolished,Pavilion Plan,Snowden Ashford,D.C. General Hospital complex,"The old psychiatric ward at Gallinger Hospital was built in response to national reform trends, but construction was also spurred on by the dire need for mental health care facilities in the District of Columbia. In the first two decades of the twentieth century, St. Elizabeth and the Washington Asylum Hospitals were the only institutions in the city that cared for the mentally ill.
After the old almshouse, erected in 1847, was vacated in 1907 with the opening of the Blue Plains facility, it was used as a ward for the mentally
ill. Conditions there were considered deplorable. The entire facility was often characterized as dilapidated and in 1916 became the subject of a newspaper
expose decrying the squalid conditions as a ""disgrace to the capital."" In spite of this reform fervor, construction was delayed on the hospital by the
political squabble over the hospital's site and the onset of World War I.
The Galiinger Municipal Hospital Psychopathic Ward was built between 1920 and 1922. The structure is an important example of a period
and typical  of psychiatric hospital design, and it also reflects the success of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts policy in implementing a uniform classical
architectural expression for the District's public buildings after its formation in 1910. Designed in 1919 by Municipal Architect Snowden Ashford (1866-
1927), the hospital ward was constructed by local contractor George H. Wynne at a cost of $766,200. Upon completion in 1923 the facility gamed immediate notice for its efficient Colonial Revival design and was featured in the influential health care journal Modern Hospital in 1924. it was also illustrated and described in a standard text on hospital planning, The American Hospital of the Twentieth Century (1926). The building group epitomized the ""home-like"" pavilion ward believed to be the best architectural solution for the general hospital's treatment of short-term psychiatric patients during the 1920s.
Gallinger Hospital was originally to be placed in Northwest Washington, but strenuous Public protests influenced Congress to site the facility on Reservation 13. Plans for the hospital were developed by Washington architect Leon Dessez in 1915- However. Dessez's contract expired after 1917 and the delay caused by the prolonged fight over the hospital site and the change of site required new plans and revised cost estimates. Subsequently, Snowden Ashford prepared the designs for the building group and probably benefited from Dessez's Colonial Revival studies for the facility, which were approved by the Commission of Fine Arts for the
14th and Upshur Street N,W. site. Ashford's Colonial Revival design for the hospital buildings was emblematic of the conservative municipal architectural expression envisioned in the design policy of the Commission of Fine Arts.
The new psychopathic ward opened on January 1st 1923, and the facility's early history was indicative of the symbiotic relationship which
developed between the psychiatric wards of general hospitals and state institutions for the mentally ill before World War II. The ward's function
was to provide care, examination, and observation of persons suffering or believed to be suffering from mental illness, pending commitment to St.
Elizabeth Hospital. The facility also administered short-term care for patients and, when the courts requested, evaluated the mental faculties of criminals
and juvenile delinquents.
The Gallinger psychopathic ward also was a psychiatric educational center. Doctors on the faculty at Georgetown and George Washington University medical schools were appointed visiting physicians at Gallinger and their students cared for and treated patients in the general hospital and psychiatric wards. An even more formal link evolved between Gallinger and the Capital City School of Nursing (1877-1972) which was integral to the hospital !s operation. These developments were significant because a whole generation of doctors and nurses in Washington would benefit from study of the psychological and emotional needs of the psychiatric patients at Gallinger in the 1920s and 1930s. The educational program at the hospital was indicative of national trends that encouraged the integration of medical and psychiatric instruction and promoted new career patterns in the mental health professions.
Although serious patient complaints concerning the building or care at the facility were rare, investigations of the hospital were conducted in 1929 and 1941 in response to charges of malpractice. The press usually sensationalized any news about the psychiatric hospital and causes for inspections. In fact one reporter claimed he was held there as a political prisoner. He stated he had been placed in the hospital against his will by the police because of his discovery of corruption
in the Veterans Administration, The reporter's eyewitness account, of his stay at the hospital was a rambling essay of abuses he had suffered there in
19.3d entitled. The Capital's Siberia. In each instance formal investigation reports cited no substantial grounds for complaints and praised the hospital's
staff for their efficiency and high spirits in the face of shortages of equipment, personnel, and financial support.
In 1944 the District Commissioners requested St. Elizabeth Hospital's superintendent Dr. Winfred Overhoiser to inspect the psychiatric facility and
make recommendations for improvements. In his report Overhoiser stated that the main problem was structural because the building was Ineptly
planned"" and ""barnlike"" in appearance. He suggested that a new psychiatric building be erected and that the old ward be converted for other uses.
Ironically, a member of Overholser's inspection team was Dr. Samuel W. Hamilton of New York, who had initially praised the design in his 1924
article in the Modern Hospital. What had been a model psychiatric facility to the eminent psychiatrist in the 1920s was now outmoded and a ""place of
astonishing inconvenience"" by the end of World War II.30 A new psychiatric facility was built at the hospital in 1955, and the old ward underwent major
interior conversions in 1962 and 1976.[1]
In the 1970s the building became part of Area C Community Health Center under the management of the Department of Human Resources and until recently has functioned as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center and venereal disease clinic. Construction of a prison on the site was planned in 1986, with preservationists contesting the plan until 1989.[5] The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February, 1989 and were demolished c. 1990. The controversial closing of the public hospital in 2001 ended the inpatient services and the city's indigent health care system was transferred mostly to the Greater Southeast Community Hospital.

Washington DC,Forest Haven,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Forest_Haven,,,1925,Closed,Cottage Plan,,District Training School for the Mentally Retarded | District of Columbia Children's Center | Oak Hill Youth Center,"Congress built the brick campus in 1925 as a place to exile people classified as ""idiots"" from the nation's capital and hide them in a rural area, records show. The District of Columbia was feeling political pressure from the then-wealthy Logan Circle neighborhood to close the nearby Washington Home For Colored Idiots.
Some of those who built Forest Haven as a replacement for the Washington Home may have had good intentions. Residents lived in tree-shaded dorms with bucolic names such as Elm or Poplar Cottage. Counselors taught residents to tend crops, milk cows and work in the laundry room. Forest haven was initialy considered a ""progressive"" institution by the standards of the time, there were baseball fields, a pool and gymnasium. But as the years went on and the district suffered from financial crises,and by the 1960's virtualy all recreation and education stopped. Following worsening conditions and a barrarage of abuse allegations, in 1978 a civil lawsuit was filed by parents of many children at forest haven, this massive lawsuit eventualy led to many patients being transfered to group homes in the area, where they were able to recive more attentative care.
While initialy meant for children with serious disabilities (called ""retarded"" in the 20th century) Forest haven started to reflect a story all too common in Mental institutions, in the mid 20th century especialy the institution was used more and more as a convienient dumping grounds, Forest Haven became the home to many people who had relativley minor learning disabilities such as Dyslexia and physical disabilities such as blindness. Children who did not speak English as their native language were also sometimes dumped here, many of these people could take care of themselves and only needed help from parents however due to social stigmas in the 60's many of these people where dumped in these facilities. In 1974 twenty perfectly functional orphans were also sent to Forest Haven purley because the orphanage they were housed in had closed. Forest haven was not just overcrowded but also understaffed, with up to 100 open positions, these positions were not filled mostly due to a lack of funds and inability to pay a large number of staff.:Like many other institutions throughout the country Forest Havens problems came from stigmitization of mental disabilities (wich led to many people dumping their disabled children and overcrowding at these institutions)  and decades of state budget cuts (wich led to these institutons not being able to hire addaquite staff or even make needed repairs to buildings).
The residents' bodies and bank accounts were abused. A district court in September 1981 convicted a Forest Haven worker of stealing $40,000 from residents' savings accounts. Staff members locked dozens of residents, naked except for adult-sized diapers, in rooms stripped of furniture other than wooden benches, according to the 1976 lawsuit. Some residents were tied to beds and chairs, and some choked to death on food the staff fed to them while they were restrained. A doctor serving the institution was ruled to be ""professionally incompetent"" by the Maryland Commission on Medical Discipline in 1988. [1]
The facility was closed on October, 14th, 1991. The closure was enforced through a federal court order after years of allegations of abuse, medical incompetence, and several deaths of aspriration pneumea. The last resident of forest haven was relocated on september, 29th, 1991.
When the residents died, the staff dumped them into unmarked graves in a field near the administration building. Nothing told passers-by that there were bodies beneath the grass from the first burial in 1928 until 1982, when families raised a single gray monument as a memorial to the 389 dead. Due to poor planning and hasty burial some grave sights have been disturbed by erosion from the Little Patuxent River.",1991 (as a mental health facility),"Laurel, MD",,,1925.0,1991.0,,,,0

Washington DC,Washington Sanitarium and Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Washington_Sanitarium_and_Hospital,1903.0,1906.0,1907,Demolished,Single Building,,Washington Adventist Hospital,"The Adventists, then headquartered in Battle Creek, Mich., bought the land after a Boston physician, Dr. Flower, spent $60,000 clearing the property for a medical institution but ran into financial troubles and had to abandon the project. The mortgage holder ‘‘gladly sold the land to the Seventh-day Adventist group for $6,000,” according to the Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia, Second Edition. Construction on the four-story building began in 1906 and it opened June 13, 1907, as the Washington Sanitarium and Hospital. At the time, Takoma Park was a resort community with homes dotted among trees. One of the hospital's first major investments was the purchase of a local dairy farm to obtain fresh milk for patients. The hospital provided training for nurses and medics during World War I and introduced ambulance services in 1924.
A nurses dormitory was built in 1909; the old hospital building in 1918; additions to the main building in 1920; the Lisner Memorial wing in 1940; a new $1.4 million six-story hospital expansion in 1950; a five-bed coronary care unit in 1967; and an addition to the coronary care unit in 1975. In 1970, the hospital launched its largest expansion project to date: a four-year $12.5 million project that added 180,000 square feet, increased hospital beds to 366 and provided a mental health unit with 43 beds.
In 1976, when the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation and the Maryland state fire marshal adopted new fire codes. Because the old sanitarium building was largely made of wood, it was no longer up to code. With renovation costs in excess of $5 million, the hospital sought to raze the building. Residents, however, opposed that plan. Over the next two years, in a series of well-publicized battles, residents fought the hospital to keep the building from being demolished, but eventually lost. In 1982, the historic building was torn down.",,"Washington, DC",,,1907.0,,366.0,,,0
