Connecticut,Connecticut State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Connecticut_State_Hospital,1866,"June 20, 1867","April 30, 1868",Active,Kirkbride Plan,,Connecticut Asylum for the Insane | Connecticut Valley Hospital,"In 1866 an act to create a hospital for the insane in the State of Connecticut was passed, but the birthday of the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane cannot truly be said to have occurred until it was delivered to the public April 30, 1868.
The report of the commission appointed by the Assembly in the year 1865 showed that there were 706 insane persons in the State of Connecticut, of whom 202 were in the Retreat at Hartford; 204 in the almshouses; and 300 outside of both; that it was impossible to secure suitable care and medical attention for this large and deeply afflicted class, either in the Retreat or in the almshouses, or in private houses; and that considerations of humanity and of true economy, as well as public welfare, demanded that these persons should liberally be provided for by the state.
The act, modified and supplemented by other acts, appears in the revision of the General Statutes, 1888. It provided that ""The land of the state and its appurtenances in Middletown shall be and remain the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane."" Further, ""That the government shall be vested in a board consisting of the Governor and 12 trustees to be appointed by the Senate, one from each county and four from the vicinity of the institution. During the regular session of the General Assembly of 1889 the Senate shall appoint six of said trustees, of whom three shall hold office for four years from the first day of July, 1889, and three for three years from the first day of July, 1890. During the regular session of the General Assembly of 1891, and biennially thereafter, the Senate shall appoint six trustees, who shall hold office for four years from the first day of July following their appointment. The Governor may fill any vacancy which occurs during the recess of the General Assembly until its regular session. No trustee shall receive compensation for his services.
1 This history was prepared by the late Dr. Henry S. Noble.
""The trustees shall have charge of the general interests of the institution, make and execute its by-laws, appoint and remove its officers and attendants, fix their compensation, exercise a strict supervision over all its expenditures, and may receive by bequest, devise or gift property for the use of the hospital.
""They shall appoint a superintendent, not of their own number, who shall be a competent physician and reside in or near the hospital.
""They shall appoint a treasurer, with a salary not exceeding $400 a year, who shall give a bond to the state of $10,000 and whose accounts, with the vouchers, shall be submitted quarterly, and oftener if required, to the trustees, with a written statement of his disbursements and funds in hand; and his books shall be at all times open to the trustees.""
From 1866 the successive Governors of Connecticut have been ex-officio members of the Board of Trustees.
Middletown, which is situated on a bend of the Connecticut River, nearly at the center of the state and easily reached from all points, was chosen as the location for the Hospital, not only because it was central, but also because here it was possible to obtain abundance of water from a reservoir by gravity, and to dispose of sewage by the simple method of surface irrigation on the farm; moreover the river was conveniently near for the delivery of coal and other freight. The people of Middletown granted a suitable farm and valuable water privileges.
Besides the land given by the town of Middletown, 80 acres adjoining it were purchased. From time to time other purchases of land have been required by the growth of the Hospital until in 1912 the total amounted to 650 acres.
In 1867 connection was made with the first reservoir by a castiron pipe six inches in diameter. In 1887 a companion water main eight inches in diameter was laid.
After the site was chosen building operations progressed sufficiently to permit the corner-stone of the Hospital to be laid June 20, 1867. On May-day, 1868, the center and one wing of the main building were ready for the accommodation of patients. During the succeeding six years the other three wings were added, and in 1874 the Hospital was considered to be complete, having beds for 450 patients.
This stone structure, four stories high, was built on the so-called ""linear"" plan, with eight wards for patients on either side of the central portion, in which were the kitchens and offices. Back of the center and connected by an underground tramway were the laundry, bakery, sewing room, engine room and the boilers. Still further back was the ""annex,"" at first used as a joiners' and painters' shop, although erected "" with the ulterior view "" of being devoted to the isolation of insane convicts.
Already the utility of the ""cottage system"" had been demonstrated by lodging certain demented patients in two old dwelling houses left standing on the hospital grounds. By the river, a third of a mile away, was the hospital dock, and near it the coal house. A large barn and a piggery completed the list of structures at that time. The total appropriations for land and construction, 18661876, amounted to $640,043.
These provisions did not long suffice, for the trustees state in their report to the Legislature of 1877, that as they ""do not deem it desirable to enlarge this hospital, they earnestly urge the importance of immediate provision for the erection of a new hospital""; and to the Legislature of 1878 they mention the urgent need of ""another hospital of similar grade."" The next year the board repeated this advice, as the Hospital was overcrowded and insane persons were obliged to wait for weeks to be admitted, or else be cared for in other institutions.
It was also in 1879 that a commission, consisting of Gurdon W. Russell, M. D., Henry W. Buel, M. D., and Ephraim Williams, appointed by the Governor to investigate the need of further accommodations for the insane poor of the state and to report upon a location and plans for such hospital buildings if needed, reported to the General Assembly that further accommodations were necessary, there being about 400 insane poor for whom the state had made no hospital provision, and they recommended erecting in the immediate vicinity of the existing hospital plain buildings of brick, containing 250 beds.
Nevertheless, no legislative action was taken until the following year, when it was resolved by the General Assembly and approved by the Governor, March 24, 1880, ""that a committee of three be appointed by the Governor, who shall cause to be built within one year additional buildings for the accommodation of the insane, adjacent to the present hospital at Middletown, according to the plans and estimates of the commission presented to this General Assembly; and that there be appropriated from any moneys now in the treasury of this state a sum not exceeding $130,000 for the erection and furnishing of said buildings. Said committee shall make report to the next session of the General Assembly; provided, that of the sum hereby appropriated not less than $5000 shall be reserved for the construction of suitable buildings or apartments upon the grounds of said Connecticut Hospital for the Insane wherein insane convicts shall be placed and cared for separate from the other inmates of said hospital.""
In accordance with this act the Governor appointed as a building committee Melancthon Storrs, M. D., William J. Atwater and Charles G. R. Vinal, who immediately entered upon their duties.
It was found that the inclination of the ground at the south end of the proposed building favored the construction of a small ward in the basement, and the required separate apartments for insane female convicts were there provided, the trustees having already devoted the "" annex "" to the use of male convicts.
To the Legislature of 1881 the committee was able to report satisfactory progress, and July 20 the building, finished and furnished at an expense of $130,000 with 262 beds for patients, was formally transferred by the committee to the Board of Trustees. This was made the occasion of a memorial gathering of many friends of the hospital.
The pressing need of more room may be inferred from the fact that the new building was soon filled to excess, and that the Legislature in 1884 and 1885 made appropriations for the erection, on land purchased by special appropriations in 1882, of an additional building "" for the care of the insane of this state, and particularly to furnish one or more wards for the better classification and accommodation of the epileptic insane.""
This building, completed early in 1886 and furnished with 300 beds, stands about 175 feet south of the building erected in 1881; both front westward, and resemble one another in their essential features. Each is of brick, three stories high; has six wards containing 50 beds, more or less, in rooms on either side of a long corridor, broken in the center by a bay which serves as a day room; has two large dining rooms, where the patients congregate for their meals. In this particular these two buildings differ markedly from the old main building, in which every ward has its separate dining room.
The total number of patients was now above 1000, and the revenue began to exceed the cost of maintenance.1 The resulting surplus of cash enabled the trustees to make several improvements rendered necessary by the growth of the hospital.
An addition to the annex provided a workshop for convicts. A reception room and a medical office were added to the middle hospital. A supplemental water main was laid; a green house and bowling alley were built; a brick cottage, accommodating 70 patients, chiefly those working out of doors; a horse barn, coal house, an ice house and a cottage for employees were also erected.
The Legislature bestowed more than tacit approval upon these expenditures, for in 1889, the Hospital then having 1300 patients,
1 The trustees of the hospital are the custodians of a certain fund known as the Atwater fund, created by the following clause in the will of the late George Atwater, of the town of Hamden, dated October 2, 1867:
""I direct and require that the said assistant trustees of my estate shall within two years after the death of my said wife Maria, if she shall survive my said daughter Eunice, or within two years after the death of my said daughter Eunice, if she shall survive her mother, convey to the persons who shall at that time constitute the Board of Trustees of 'The General Hospital for the Insane of the State of Connecticut,' located in Middletown, to them and their successors in office, all the remainder of my estate, both real and personal, to have and to hold the same in trust for the uses, intents and purposes hereinafter mentioned and declared concerning the same, viz.:
""The said trustees of the General Hospital for the Insane of the State of Connecticut shall reserve the whole amount received from my estate as a separate fund (to be known as the Atwater fund) for the benefit of the insane poor of the State of Connecticut, and shall have the right to appropriate and expend the annual income of the fund for the support of indigent insane persons, giving preference to indigent insane persons, if any such there may be, belonging to and having legal residence in my native town of Hamden; but the said trustees shall not appropriate or expend the principal of the fund.""
This trust fund was accepted by a vote of the trustees of the hospital January 14, 1886.
it was resolved by the General Assembly that the Board of Trustees be authorized and instructed to expend from the funds of the Hospital an amount necessary to erect a building furnishing accommodations for at least 120 persons. By an addition to each wing of the south hospital, and by the completion of the unpretentious, but very comfortable and convenient, cottage, of which one-third was built the year before, 150 patients were accommodated.
Other items of construction followed, of which the most costly was an assembly room, seating over 600 persons, the original chapel and amusement hall being no longer adequate.
As the number of patients again exceeded the capacity of the institution and a disposition to enlarge it still further was manifested by the Legislature, it was voted at a special meeting of the Board of Trustees, April, 1889, that "" in the opinion of this board the economic and humane interests of the state require that additional accommodations for its insane be provided in some other locality.""
In 1893 the General Assembly resolved ""that a building committee of five members, three of whom shall be elected by the Trustees of the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane, and two of whom shall be elected by the Senate, be authorized and directed to cause the erection in the town of Middletown of a suitable building sufficient for the accommodation of 250 insane persons of the class known as incurable insane; and to expend for said purpose a sum of money not to exceed $70,000. A further sum of $30,000, or so much thereof as shall be necessary, is hereby appropriated from the State Treasury to furnish and complete said building.""
This act was approved June 30, 1893, and the Trustees elected from their number Henry Woodward, Andrew C. Smith and Samuel Russell to be members of the building committee.
Already the Trustees, finding the water supply insufficient in the time of drought, had availed themselves of the privileges guaranteed to them by the town of Middletown, "" the full and complete use and enjoyment of the water of Butler's Creek and Silver Creek,"" by purchasing the requisite land and constructing a reservoir on Silver Creek. Fortunately, too, just at this time, a farm extending from the northern limit of the hospital grounds to the Connecticut River was for sale, and its purchase provided a most admirable site for the future buildings. As from time to time the water supply has threatened to be inadequate, other reservoirs have been added to the first one built in 1867. The water is all delivered to the hospital by gravity, and efficient fire protection is maintained by the pressure afforded by the 160-175 feet elevation of the principal reservoirs, but this has been supplemented by the installation of a powerful fire pump.
Section 7, Chapter 102, of the Public Acts, 1867, provides that ""the trustees are hereby authorized and empowered to make and establish such by-laws as they may deem necessary and expedient.""
Accordingly, the Board of Trustees adopted certain by-laws and regulations and revised them in 1887 and again in 1902, designating the duties of the persons employed in the Hospital, viz.:
1. The superintendent is required to exercise "".entire official control over all subordinate officers "" and over the treatment of all patients; to conduct the correspondence and to see that due care is taken of all hospital property.
2. The assistant physicians, each has under his special care a certain number of patients for individual study and treatment.
3. The business manager and assistant keep all the accounts of the hospital, except those in the hands of the treasurer, and purchase the groceries, provisions and supplies for the institution.
4. The farmer has charge of the agricultural operations, the butchering, preservation and distribution of meats and the delivery of freight.
5. The matron has charge of all work done in the laundry and the sewing rooms.
6. The housekeepers have charge of the ordinary domestic matters in their respective households and attend particularly to the preparation of food for the patients.
7. The supervisors have the immediate direction of the ward attendants and instruct them in their duties, such as the management of patients, the nursing of the sick, the prevention of escapes, the care of patients' clothing and the cleanliness of the wards.
8. The storekeeper, under the instruction of the business manager, takes care of the stock in store and issues supplies on requisition of housekeepers, supervisors and others, keeping due account of the same.
9. The mechanics, comprising the engineer and electrician, have charge of the heating apparatus, plumbing and gas-piping, and all electrical power and machinery.
By 1893 the Hospital buildings had increased from one to five, with capacity ranging from 250 to 675, aside from cottages, and the population of the institution had risen to 1535.
The Legislature of that year having decided to provide additional accommodations for the insane, the work of building what is now known as the north hospital was at once commenced, and about 52 acres of land were purchased from the heirs of Elisha S. Hubbard. This tract included a substantial farm house, which has since afforded accommodations for about 36 male patients. The farm extended from the northern boundary of the hospital grounds across the Valley Railway to the Connecticut River, and afforded a site for the present wharf, coal pocket, spur tracks, coal and merchandise hoisting apparatus, and shuttle railway operated by electricity, by which all coal and heavy merchandise are delivered to the hospital buildings.
The north hospital, with accommodations for 250 patients of the chronic class, was completed within the appropriation of $100,000, $70,000 of which was taken from funds in the hands of the Trustees, and $30,000 was appropriated by the Legislature. This building was scarcely complete when the urgent necessity of additional accommodations was apparent. To meet this demand the Trustees proceeded to erect an additional wing to the north hospital for the accommodation of 50 female patients, at a cost of $20,250, which was taken from Hospital funds.
This wing was no sooner completed than an equally urgent demand arose for further accommodations for male patients. This was met by the erection of a wing at the north end of the north hospital, corresponding to that erected for female patients at the south end, and contained accommodations for 50 male patients. The cost was $17,623. At the close of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1898, the census of the Hospital had risen to 1895.
In 1896 the training school for nurses and attendants was inaugurated and has continued ever since, with the exception of an interval from 1896 to 1901.
During the biennial period ending September 30, 1898, several buildings of importance were added io the equipment. A mortuary building of stone and brick, with tiled roof, was erected at a cost of $6524.54. A substantial iron fence was built on the north and south sides of Silver Street in front of the main grounds. Iron verandas and fire escapes for three stories were added to the south hospital, which afford airing facilities for such patients as are unable to avail themselves of out-of-door exercise. A brick, iron, cement and glass cow barn was erected, with stabling for 100 cows, at a cost of $16,902.10.
During the following biennial period, ending with September 30, 1900, two infirmary wards, with accommodations for 70 patients each, were added to the north hospital at a cost of $6471.53. The laboratory for clinical and pathological work was established and equipped in the south end of this building, and has since proved a valuable adjunct to the scientific work of the institution. Day balconies and fire escapes, which during the winter months are enclosed in glass, were added to the main hospital at a cost of $3840.
The unprecedented drought of 1899 aroused the Trustees to the necessity of providing an additional water supply, which resulted in the building of No. 4 reservoir. This was completed in the summer of 1900 at a cost of $15,813.19, and has a capacity of 33,000,000 gallons.
During the following period from 1900 to 1902 the heating system was thoroughly reorganized, and the several detached heating plants were consolidated into one central one. The congregate building was built, comprising a congregate dining room with a capacity of 1500 persons, with kitchens, serving room, bakery, store, meat market, cold storage plant, laundry, sewing and ironing rooms, and hydrotherapeutic establishment, with a dining room for employees, at a total cost of $272,530. With the reorganization of the boiler and heating plant steam as a motive power was dispensed with, and electricity substituted. Lighting the entire institution with electricity was commenced and carried forward as rapidly as possible. Electrical power was provided for the carpenter shop, laundry, and ensilage cutters. Electric irons were provided in the ironing room. Electric elevators provided with automatic safety devices were installed in the congregate building. The steam mains for heating the south and middle hospitals and main cottage, as well as the bams and carpenter shop, were carefully insulated in earthen conduits, so as to prevent condensation. The new chimney, 141 feet in height, afforded ample draught, and the economizer and hot water heaters gave the highest percentage of return for the coal consumed. The cold storage plant, with auxiliary ice-making facilities, did excellent service, and the latter during one whole season since has supplied the Hospital with all the ice required.
During the season of 1912 the local telephone system was thoroughly overhauled and enlarged. Fifty-six stations were installed and the service handled by three operators on duty eight hours each.
During the biennial period the capacity of the south hospital was again increased to meet the ever recurring demands for more accommodations, by the erection of a three-story brick and iron addition to the north wing, 60 feet by 40 feet, containing 80 beds. The framework is of iron and the floors granolithic, covered with linoleum. These wards contain bath and toilet accommodations and communicate with the main wards of the building on the same levels through fireproof iron doors. The second and third floors are each provided with an iron veranda having an eastern exposure. These verandas serve the purpose of fire escapes, and in winter are enclosed with glass and make desirable infirmaries. The entire cost was $14,221.
The old laundry building was repaired and altered for the accommodation of female patients at a cost of $6000. Excellent accommodations were thus secured for over 100 female patients, at a cost of $68.97 Per Ded in addition to the value of the building prior to making the repairs.
On June 21, 1906, the most destructive fire in the history of the institution occurred, during which the amusement hall, chapel, dynamo, engine and tool rooms were destroyed, and for a time the center portion of the main building was in danger. Fortunately, there was no loss of life to either patients or employees.
Plans were at once completed for the erection of a thoroughly fireproof structure for engines, electrical apparatus, cold storage machinery, etc. The insurance, amounting to $30,499.04, was immediately adjusted and paid.
A municipal fire system was inaugurated, covering the entire premises by means of 24 stations, by which a repeating signal is sent to the central station, where an organized fire department is always on duty. The more hazardous localities on the premises are protected by automatic sprinklers.
Electric lighting has been gradually extended, until it now covers the entire institution.
During the biennial period ending with September 30, 1906, a new underground root and vegetable cellar was constructed, at a cost of $5983, for which no legislative appropriation was called for.
In addition the Legislature granted an appropriation of $20,000 for an isolation hospital, and the building was completed within the appropriation. It is located apart from the other hospital buildings, is thoroughly fireproof and built according to modern conceptions. It affords accommodation for 30 patients of each sex and the requisite number of nurses. It is lighted by electricity, heated by steam and provided with gas ranges for the preparation of food. To complete the equipment a large Kinyoun-Francis sterilization chamber was installed, at a cost of $1350.
The Legislature of 1906 granted an appropriation of $75,000 with which to provide a chapel or assembly room. The result was a thoroughly fireproof structure, the auditorium of which has a seating capacity of about 1400. It is connected with the main hospital, congregate dining room, middle hospital and main cottage by overhead bridges. The main floor consists of an auditorium, gallery, lobby and stage, the first two of which are provided with set opera chairs. Toilet and dressing rooms are placed at convenient points. The stage is protected from fire by automatic sprinklers and an asbestos curtain; and is furnished with ample scenery, several drop curtains, and various electrical appliances. In the basement a room has been provided for dancing. Scarcely anything other than brick, steel and concrete enters into the construction of the building. It is heated by steam and lighted by electricity, with an additional gas equipment in case of emergency. A drop curtain, pulpit and chairs effect a transformation of the stage and make it appropriate for chapel services.
The same Legislature which rendered the assembly room possible granted an appropriation of $45,000 for the purpose of building a new wharf, coal hoisting works and pocket, with an electric industrial railway for the transportation of coal and heavy merchandise from the wharf and railroad to the Hospital. A siding has been built on the Valley Division of the N. Y., N. H. & H. R. R., upon which car-load lots of merchandise are delivered and transported to the Hospital.
During the biennial period ending September 30, 1908, a mechanical filter was installed, with a capacity of 100 gallons per minute, to obviate any risk of illness from possible contamination of the water from reservoirs No. 2 and No. 5. All water supplying the institution is analyzed at regular intervals and has invariably been found free from pathogenic bacteria.
The last building to be added to the hospital equipment was the nurses' home, erected in 1909-10, for which the Legislature appropriated the sum of $75,000. This building is also fireproof, and contains comfortable quarters for over 90 employees. Twelve of the rooms in the central portion of the building are designed for married couples. Each wing provides accommodations for 35 nurses and attendants of each sex. The basement under the east, or male, wing, has been fitted up as a recreation and reading room, with billiard and card tables, magazines, periodicals, etc.
During this same biennial period the last and largest water main connecting the system of reservoirs with the Hospital buildings was laid, at a cost of $18,000, which was covered by a legislative appropriation of that amount. This main is sixteen inches in diameter and affords not only an ample supply of water for all ordinary purposes, but likewise provides increased pressure and supply in the event of fire.
The buildings constituting the institution have increased during the progress of years from one or two up to 34. The aggregate of legislative appropriations amounts to the sum of $1,470,573. Various improvements have been made from time to time, which have been paid for from the earnings of the Hospital over and above running expenses; the cost of these improvements amounts to nearly half the above mentioned sum.
Insurance is carried on the Hospital property, including buildings and contents, to the amount of $1,200,000.
The institution is now (1912) caring for 2535 patients, and has for the past two or three years been overcrowded, notwithstanding the existence of the Norwich State Hospital, with a census of about 800. Whether there will be any further expansion of the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane is problematical. It would seem to be much the wiser policy to organize a third institution in the southwest quarter of the state, rather than to continue overcrowding those already in operation.[1]
Over the years of the hospital's operation many more buildings were built. Some time during the 20th century the administration section of the Main Building was modified pretty extensively. An additional floor was added to the building, as a result the decorative roof line was removed, causing the administration section to stand out from the rest of the building. The ground in front of the building was excavated and lowered and a new entrance was built. Half of the north wing of the Main Building has also been removed. The hospital saw its patient population increase to a max of 3000 patients in 1951 but slowly it dwindled down to about 180 in 1995. In 1961, Connecticut State Hospital changed its name to Connecticut Valley Hospital. Currently, various state services are being run out of the hospital. Some time around 2006-2007 the south ""Kirkbride-like"" building was demolished.
Connecticut Valley Hospital is comprised of three divisions: general psychiatry; addiction services; and Whiting forensic services. Patients receiving the services from the Whiting forensic division may reside in the Whiting maximum security building, the Dutcher medium security building or the restoration to competency unit located in Battell Hall. Although the Whiting Forensic Division receives the majority of its admissions by order of a criminal court, Whiting is a hospital administered by DMHAS and is therefore obligated to provide active and effective treatment. It is not a correctional facility. [2]

The cemetery at Connecticut Valley Hospital is located at the foot of the hill to the east of the Hospital in the middle of what was once the Hospital’s farming operation.  An unpaved city road separates the first two hundred graves from the main section of the cemetery.  There were 1652 persons buried here between 1878 and 1955 and the majority of the graves are identified by a simple concrete marker with only a number. These are the graves of persons anonymous to the world who died here without a family or friend to claim them and take them home. Three markers now have been erected and names, age, date of death, and stone number have been continuously added.Since 1999 there has been an annual ceremony to honor and name those buried on the grounds.",,"Middletown, CT",,3125 in 1950,1868,,450,,3000,0
Connecticut,Fairfield State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fairfield_State_Hospital,"June 18, 1929","Sept. 3, 1930","July 5, 1933",Preserved,Cottage Plan,"Walter P. Crabtree, Sr",Fairfield Hills Hospital,"Fairfield State Hospital was created due to overcrowding at the other two state hospitals. The over all campus building style was Colonial Revival that was typical throughout New England. The hospital was designed not to have any dark corners or cubbyholes. A dedication ceremony was held June 10, 1931.. Roughly half of the main buildings were erected in the 1930s and '40s, with the rest of the larger ones completed in the 1950s.
Fairfield State Hospital, the third public mental institution to be established in Connecticut, had a stormy history from its inception. Members of the community actively resisted its location in the vicinity of Newtown and, for more than a decade, their attitudes had a negative Impact on its development. Dr. Leak, its first superintendent, although on the staff of Connecticut State Hospital for more than fifteen years and its superintendent for more than ten years, did not apply the knowledge gained through these personal experiences. Apparently neither he nor the Board of Trustees of Fairfield State Hospital recognized the importance of capitalizing on the developments that had taken place since the turn of the century at Connecticut State Hospital and Norwich State Hospital. From the beginning the Board expressed the attitude that this state facility for the men- tally ill would surpass its predecessors in the care and cure of those unfortunate People whose minds have become deranged with strange fancies and who have lost control over their thoughts and emotions.
This attitude contributed to the lack of communication between Fairfield State Hospital and the two other hospitals and perpetuated its isolation for more than twenty years. The associated drive for autonomy was reflected in the overt resistance to being integrated into the Department of Mental Health. This opposition was expressed by both the Board and the Superintendent during the fifties and sixties. Consequently advanced psychiatric concepts, practices and principles in nursing advocated by the Chief, Nursing Services were not accepted and implemented as readily in Fairfield Hills Hospital as in its sister hospitals.
Although the hospital was opened in the early thirties to relieve the overcrowding of both Connecticut State and Norwich State Hospitals, this objective was not achieved until the advent of the Unit System. Before 1964 the three State Hospitals were overcrowded and filled beyond their authorized capacities. With the implementation of the Unit System at Connecticut Valley and Norwich Hospitals in the mid sixties their respective patient populations were significantly decreased. Fairfield Hills Hospital remained over its capacity until it was decentralized into the Geographic U nit System in 1970. This hospital received its first patients on June 21, 1933 from Connecticut State Hospital. These patients were from Fairfield and Litchfield Counties and were selected by Dr. leak. with the thought of providing a nucleus for the essential working service of the institution...stress had been placed on maintaining a high percentage of employed patients not only for utilitarian purposes but for therapy as well.
By June 30, 1934, 536 patients had been received at intervals from Connecticut and Norwich State Hospitals. As at that time there were only two buildings, Shelton and Greenwich Houses, equipped to receive patients; the total capacity of the hospital was 500. With discharges, transfers and deaths, by the end of the first fiscal year, the census was reduced to 495. To care for this number of patients there were four physicians, including the superintendent, and fifty-eight psychiatric attendants. At that time the two nurses were also called psychiatric attendants and received the same salary. There were seventy-six other employees making a total of 136 in the Hospital.
In 1936 Fairfield State Hospital received 366 transfers from the other two hospitals, seventeen patients were discharged, and ten died. The average daily census was 507. The number of physicians remained four. There was an increase of ten in nursing service making a total of sixty- eight and the overall number of employees was 159. By June 30, 1940 there was a decline in the number of transfers, only fifty-three patients were received from the two other hospitals; the average daily census was 930. The number of physicians had increased to six. There were eighty-two attendants, and ten graduate nurses counting the director of nursing service and assistant director in nursing education. Also there were two occupational therapists, one social worker, and one dentist on the staff. Other employees totaled 102, thus bringing the number of employees to 204.
During the years 1940 and 1941 Kent and Canaan Houses were completed and for the first time patients were admitted directly from the community. However, transfers from Connecticut and Norwich State Hospitals continued. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1941 there were 103 discharges and 86 deaths. The average daily census was 1,361. The staff included six physicians, twenty-one graduate nurses and 206 attendants, two occupational therapists and one social worker. The total number of hospital employees was 389. During the next eight years, the number of admissions increased significantly. This was primarily due to the direct admission of patients from the areas served by the hospital. However, transfers continued to be accepted from Connecticut and Norwich State Hospitals. During this period admissions averaged 797 patients each year. The average daily patient census increased steadily from 2,026 in 1942 to 2,692 in 1949, an increase of almost 28 per cent.
In the 1940s the turnover in ward personnel at times was over 50 per cent. In 1942, fifty-two employees were hired for nursing service and sixty-two, resigned. The high attrition rate was reflected in all departments of the hospital. During the fiscal year of 1946, 406 people were recruited to fill empty positions and 311 personnel had terminated. As of June 30, 1948, there were twenty-four graduate nurses and 203 psychiatric aides. In February 1949 the total number of hospital personnel had reached an all time high of 518; 255 of this number were in nursing service.
For the first time during the year ending June 30, 1951, admissions exceeded 1,000 and gradually increased to 1,715 by June 30, 1959. The discharge rate during this period increased from 680 to 1,228; the number of deaths fluctuated between 294 and 427 with a yearly average of 346. The average daily census ranged from 2,697 in 1957 to 2,871 in 1959. Nursing personnel also increased during this decade; graduate nurses, from twenty-five to sixty-five and psychiatric aides, from 222 to 506, an increase of more than 131 per cent. There was also an increase in personnel in other departments by the end of the fifties; physicians numbered seventeen, social workers, six and five case workers, four occupational therapists plus twenty-two students, and three psychologists.
From June 1960 to June 30, 1972 the annual number of admissions increased from 1,993 to 4,663; discharges, from 1,780 to 5,120; deaths ranged from a high of 482 in 1960 to a low of 158 on June 30, 1970 with the annual average of 325. The average daily census decreased from 2,723 to 1,496. For the first time since the establishment of the hospital, the number of patients discharged, 3,636, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966 exceeded the number of admissions, 3,443, by more than 5 per cent. During the next three years, the number of admissions exceeded the discharges by about 4 per cent. The trend was again re- versed in 1970 with the decentralization of the hospital; the discharges exceeded the admissions by 2.5 per cent during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970; by 3.68 per cent during the next year, and by almost 9 per cent during the year ending June 30, 1972.
During the sixties the number of registered nurses employed fluctuated between fifty-one and sixty-two; the number steadily increased thereafter and by June 30, 1972, seventy-four full time and twenty-seven part time nurses were on the staff. During this same period the number of psychiatric aides also fluctuated with a yearly average of 511. By June 30, 1972, the number of psychiatric aides had decreased to 442, or by almost 18 per cent. The number of physicians increased from twenty-two in 1960, to a high of forty-one in 1968, then decreased to twenty- nine in 1970 and on June 30, 1972 increased again to thirty-five. (Physicians enrolled in the psychiatric residency training program were counted as medical staff.)
During this period from 1960 to 1972 the other departments within the hospital showed a slow but steady increase. The number of psychologists increased from four, in 1960; to six, in 1968 and 1970; and to seven, in 1972. The number of occupational therapists increased from six, in 1960; to ten, in 1968 and to fifteen, in 1970; thereafter, the number remained the same through the 1972 fiscal year. The social service department increased from four, in 1960; to eight, in 1968; and to twelve, in 1970. During the 1972 fiscal year there were twenty-five social workers in the department.
It is interesting to note that during the period extending from 1939 through 1950 the affiliating nursing students were listed as nursing personnel. Students were used as regular staff and classes were arranged during the afternoons after the ward work had been completed. They also worked the evening and night shifts. During this period the needs of nursing service took precedence over the learning needs of the students. The first group to affiliate included ten nursing students. Thereafter the number gradually increased so that by 1952 there were from sixty to sixty-five students in each group. Until 1953 there were no changes in this program. Students were taken off night duty but continued to be assigned to the evening shift until 9:00 P .M .The two nursing schools associated with the Fanny Allen and Mary Fletcher Hospitals in Vermont terminated their affiliation in September 1957; thereafter, the number of students in each affiliation group ranged from forty-five to fifty-five. In the later part of the 1960s, Danbury Hospital discontinued its School of Nursing. The Norwalk Hospital and Waterbury Hospital Schools of Nursing terminated their affiliation at Fairfield Hills Hospital in order to participate in an eight-week program at another psychiatric facility. In 1970 St. Mary's Hospital School of Nursing employed a psychiatric nurse clinical instructor to teach psychiatric nursing to their students but continued to use the clinical resources of Fairfield Hills Hospital. During the early seventies the number of students in each affiliation ranged from fifteen to thirty. Two nurse clinical instructors and the Director of Nursing Education were responsible for the instruction, guidance and supervision of the nursing students. Beginning in 1958 with the initiation of the educational work- shops, radical changes were made in the theoretical and clinical experiences provided for nursing students. The theoretical program changed from the didactic formal lectures, primarily given by the physician, to informal discussions with emphasis on group process and group dynamics under the leadership of the nurse instructor; the clinical experience, from frequent rotations to an assignment on the same ward for the duration of the affiliation. Also there was a gradual change in the nature of their assignments: not until the early sixties were they permitted to interact with individual and groups of patients. Thereafter the development of interpersonal relationships became the core of the program and the learning needs of the students took precedence over service needs.
For the-thirty-nine years of the existence of the hospital the Nursing Department was plagued by a large turnover and shortage of personnel. The nursing care was primarily custodial and members of the staff were given little recognition. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, some of the nursing personnel made attempts to change the ward environment and to organize and participate in therapeutic programs with their patients. They were influenced by the nursing students who were, under supervision, developing interpersonal relationships with selected patients and later, by the psychiatric aide trainees. These attempts were 'short-lived' as rotation to different wards and shifts were frequently made. This caused the staff to feel frustrated and discouraged. In 1970, with the implementation of the unit system and the establishment of the multidisciplinary teams, the roles and functions of the nursing personnel began to change and they began to gain recognition from other departments. These changes caused considerable anxiety. In an effort to utilize this anxiety constructively and to provide learning experiences that would develop their potentialities and prepare them to function more therapeutically, educational programs were implemented. However, as demands were constantly being made on the ward personnel to attend group and staff meetings, it became impossible to continue these programs. Later the Staff Development Program, funded by federal monies, made a real contribution and the nursing staff became more comfortable and efficient in carrying out their expanded functions and roles as members of the multi- disciplinary team.
Until 1970 the other clinical departments functioned independently. There was very little communication with other staff of the hospital, and it was only through the 'grape vine' that one heard what they were doing. The only thing all departments had in common was shortage of personnel. With the implementation of the Unit System and the team approach for planning and administering treatment programs, each department emerged to discover the meaning of working with members of other disciplines to improve the quality of treatment so that patients could be re- habilitated and returned to the community.
Future plans for other changes are now being made. Members of each Department are included in formulating these plans and are becoming more aware of the need for improving communication and relation- ships between departments as well as with the community. It is hoped that all of this will help to further improve and extend the psychiatric treatment programs for all patients whether in the hospital or in the community. [1]
Due to deinstitutionalization in the '60s and '70s, there was less of a need for hospitals like Fairfield Hills. With the high cost of running underused hospitals, state hospitals around the country shut their doors. In 1995, Gov. John Rowland closed Fairfield Hills and its sister hospital, Norwich State Hospital. All patients that remained were moved to Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown, Connecticut. The Town of Newtown rented out the first floor of Canaan House from the mid-1990s up until 2005; it was home to the town's Board of Education, Planning & Zoning, and Fire Marshall. The Reed Intermediate School is also located on the property.
On June 7, 2001, the voters at a Town Meeting approved the purchase of the former Fairfield Hills Hospital from the State of Connecticut. A major portion of the land on the 185-acre Fairfield Hills campus has been reserved for municipal and cultural use, as well as passive and active recreational use. The campus is open daily for the public to enjoy during daylight hours. Hiking trails are available for public use and the various playing fields are managed by the Newtown Parks and Recreation Department.
A comprehensive reuse vision for the property is presented in the Fairfield Hills Master Plan. A select number of existing buildings and land parcels have been designated for private commercial purposes. A number of commercial uses including retail, offices, restaurants, banks, sports, cultural activities and business services will provide the community with a vibrant multipurpose campus.
On November 1, 2008 the Newtown Youth Academy celebrated it's grand opening. The new building sits at the rear of the property and occupies the land where the Bridgewater House once stood.[2] The Greenwich House, located just in front of the new Youth Center was demolished in 2009 to make room for a parking lot.[3]
On November 21, 2009 the Newtown Municipal Center At Fairfield Hills was dedicated. Formerly known as Bridgeport Hall, the building once served as the central dining facility at Fairfield Hills. The building has been refitted for use as the town's municipal office building. The expansive red brick structure had been in service for several weeks prior to the dedication as offices, the building has brought together most town agencies under one roof.[4]

The first hospital building was opened in 1833 on seven-and-a-half acres of land between Cedar Street and Howard Avenue, and Davenport and Congress Avenues. The original 13-bed hospital, called the State Hospital, was designed by prominent New Haven architect Ithiel Town and cost $13,000.
Since it opened in 1826, the hospital was affiliated with the Medical Institution of Yale College, which had been founded in 1810. In 1884, the hospital's name was changed to New Haven Hospital. In 1917, the Yale School of Medicine and New Haven Hospital signed their first formal affiliation agreement, which marked the beginning of the modern medical center. In 1945, an affiliation with nearby Grace Hospital led to a name change: Grace-New Haven Hospital. In 1965, a more formal agreement with Yale officially created Yale-New Haven Hospital.
Founded as a charitable institution for the care of the poor, the role of the hospital soon expanded to include care for the entire community. In its early days, sailors from New Haven's busy seaport came to the hospital for care. During the Civil War, more than 25,000 U.S. Army soldiers were brought to the hospital, which temporarily changed its name to the Knight U.S. Army General Hospital. In subsequent wars, Yale-New Haven was on alert as a designated military hospital. The Yale-New Haven Psychiatric Hospital was opened in 2000, after the purchase of the Yale Psychiatric Institute. Before that time, the hospital operated a separate ""Insane Ward"" at the hospital.",,"New Haven, CT",,,1826,,13,,25000,0
Connecticut,Norwich State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norwich_State_Hospital,,1904,1905,Demolished,Cottage Plan,Cudworth & Woodworth,Norwich Insane Asylum | Norwich State Asylum,"The Norwich State Hospital opened its doors in 1904 to the insane with ninety-five patients in one building on over 100 acres.
One of the hospital’s first superintendents believed that mechanical restraint of patients was preferable to medication and believed in hydrotherapy as a treatment measure. The Board of the hospital quickly realized the population was exceeding what was safe. In 1905, two patient buildings were built with a third opening 1907.
Thirteen buildings were erected for patients during the next eight years and in 1913 with a population of 998, an administration building, three cottages for physicians, a carpenter and maintenance shop, the main kitchen, garage, laboratory, staff house, and an employees’ clubhouse had been erected and the inebriate farm and the Colony had been established.
Seven new buildings were built between 1920 and 1930 and another building was purchased for patients’ use. In 1929, the hospital peaked with 1,115 patients while in 1930 the average daily census reached 2,422. At this point, in addition to new patient facilities, two more cottages were erected for physicians, a female employees’ home, a paint shop, a greenhouse, a superintendent’s residence, and two garages were built.
Tubercular patients were housed between 1931 and 1939 in one patient building called Seymour which led to the closure of the “Pines” buildings. Two more cottages for physicians, male employees’ homes, and a nurse’s home were also built. World War II had an impact on the staff at Norwich State Hospital with the nursing staff being reduced by more than 57 percent, a loss of 30 nurses, and 146 aides. Nursing employees for the first time only made up 44 percent of the total staff.
Non-nursing staff increased by more than 32 percent while the daily census fluctuated slightly and increased to 2,574 by 1945. In 1941, affiliations for occupational therapy students lead to the increase of the number of occupational therapists to 28 by 1945. The average daily census climbed to 2,799 by the end of 1950 while many new buildings were added to the complex hospital between 1950 and 1962, including a powerhouse, laundry, pump house, fifteen cottages for physicians, an incinerator, an Occupational Therapy Building, and employees’ building, a chapel, and a research and clinical laboratory building. The Kettle Building, which is seen by those traveling from Foxwoods to Mohegan Sun using Route 2A, was built in 1959.  At this point, the hospital sprawled to over 900 acres.
During this era, each time a new patient building was constructed, an old building was closed. It is important to realize all the buildings currently standing at Norwich State Hospital were never fully occupied at the same time and many of them were left abandoned even before the hospital officially closed. In 1956, the Lodge building was completed which resulted in patients from Butler, Cutter, and Dix being transferred and these buildings were no longer used for patients.
In 1966, Dr. Martin was appointed Superintendent and his mission was to direct quality care for patients and he met his mission by creating diversified programs. Martin wanted to increase freedom for patients and supported and encouraged a democratic administration and meeting the needs of patients and staff. The hospital slowly decreased in the population at the end of 1972 with only seven of the original buildings and one former employees’ resident in use for an average of 1,148 patients. The total staff decreased to 1,248 at this point.
The population decreases occurred as a result of increasing admissions and discharges, shorter periods of hospitalization, the development of special programs for alcohol and drug dependent and geriatric patients, and increasing emphasis on crisis intervention. Administration operations moved to a section of the Kettle building with a small monumental like the “Norwich Hospital” sign with a blue cross sitting on the grassy field. The frame of the sign still sits there today.
In the late 1990s, the hospital closed and housed only the Southeastern Connecticut Mental Health Authority in the Kettle and Lodge buildings. Later this closed down when those offices moved to the Uncas on Thames Hospital Campus.
An elderly housing complex that existed in the late 1980s when the hospital slowly downsized moved into the old male employee building near the Pond View building on the east side of Route 12. It is important to note that Norwich Hospital was the first state psychiatric hospital to initiate a referral program to Public Health Nursing Agencies for services to patients. [1]

The facility was moved to a new location on Enfield Street in Enfield, Connecticut two years later in 1980. The sanitarium treated persons suffering from nervous diseases.
In a 1916 description, Elm Croft was described as having the appearance of a ""home, rather than of a hospital or institution."" In a Connecticut Public Welfare Council Report from 1900, the facility was noted to be a small, private residence housed in a three story brick building. The sanitarium housed no more than five patients at once time, and each had a large room which were ""handsomely appointed."" The building was situated on fifty acres of ""shady lawns, fruit orchards, meadow and woodland."" [1]
A 1916 report described the sanitarium at Elm Croft in detail, noting ""the houses are of modern design heated by steam and lighted by electricity. They have open fireplaces and hardwood finish. There are 50 acres of grounds, and the farm furnishes cream, milk, butter, eggs, vegetables, etc. for the institution.

Connecticut,Elmcrest Manor,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Elmcrest_Manor,,,1938,,Cottage Plan,,"Elmcrest Manor Psychiatric Institution, Elmcrest Psychiatric Center","The Elmcrest Manor was opened in Portland, Connecticut in 1938 by Dr. Carl Wagner and his wife Magdalena. Three original buildings were used as part of the campus, dating back to the 1800s. The 17-acre campus held both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric services for both adults and children, as well as a substance abuse treatment program. In June of 1976, the hospital opened the new Creative Therapies Building. The contemporary-style building contained rooms for art, music, dance, and occupational therapies. It was the fifth new structure built since 1974. The medical director of the time, Dr. Lios B. Finerman said, 'Elmcrest has a long-range plan to provide a comprehensive integrated hospital program for the treatment of psychiatric disorders from pediatric adolescent and adult to geriatric psychological problems.""[1]
In 1997, Elmcrest had 26 buildings, with 129 beds, housing more than 150 hospital patients. Another 150 school special education children attended a day program at the facility, and a total of 475 employees worked at the facility in 1997. St. Francis hospital of Hartford, Connecticut purchased the facility from Dr. Louis B. Fierman and Dr. Lane Ameen, who had bought out the California-based National Medical Enterprises in 1994.[2]
After the purchase of the facility by St. Francis, reports of patient mistreatment increased and a number of lawsuits arose from wrongful treatment of former patients. On March 22nd, 1998, 11-year-old Andrew McClain, died as a result of suffocation from physical restraint. McClain, who was ""mildly retarded and had a history of behavior problems"", was killed only four days after being admitted, and the cause of death was ruled ""traumatic asphyxia,(and) chest compression"". After a thorough investigation, state officials determined the death was a result of abuse. Further investigations resulted in several other violations, and the hospital was fined and put under watch by the Department and Children and Families. [3]
The hospital never recovered from the tragic death of McClain. In 2000, ""Barbara Beninato, a 30-year-old patient at the facility's adult unit, died from a drug overdose while in seclusion. Investigators later determined Beninato had taken a deadly mix of 12 tranquilizers and other drugs at the hospital, which by then was operated by St. Francis. A number of administrators were fired.
In 2002, state officials began investigating at St. Francis after records showed a significant jump in juvenile arrests and assaults on the campus. Hospital authorities argued the increase had to do with patients staying longer and having more contact with each other and staff."" [4]
In 2003 the last remaining patients were moved from the 24-bed Portland property to the Mount Sinai campus in the North End of Hartford. Plans to purchase and demolish the vacant campus have been explored, but no action has been made.

In 1910 The New York Times published an article regarding Mrs. Amelia Bloch of Dr. MacFarland’s Sanitarium who fatally strangled another sanitarium patient by the name of Miss Fouchere while the nurses where not looking. A full-scale investigation was launched in 1923 when Mrs. Annie Sheeby died at McFarland’s Sanitarium and “bore bruises and marks.” Dr. McFarland was exonerated when records showed that she was among the most violent patients at the facility and her injuries were self-inflicted. Twelve days later however, McFarland struck a physically disabled man but faced no charges when the man recovered.
McFarland’s Sanitarium was later renamed Hall-Brooke Sanitarium and was under the control of Elizabeth F.S. Solomon in 1964 and in 1966 Hall-Brooke Sanitarium became the nonprofit organization, Hall-Brooke Foundation. Many Hall-Brooke employees including Dr. Robert Becker and various other state officials involved in licensing hospitals disliked Solomon’s management styles and she was later removed as director in 1980.

Connecticut,Hartford Retreat,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hartford_Retreat,1823,,,Active,Pre-1854 Plans,,Connecticut Retreat for the Insane | The Institute of Living,"From the time it opened for patients in 1824 to about 1843, the Hartford Retreat was a small, semi-public institution that focused on using a moral curative approach. This included creating a tranquil, kind environment to pacify patients and allow a respite from the hectic pace of the era’s social, political, and economic changes. Caregivers perceived that through conversation, exercise, relaxation, and above all kindness, patients could be soothed into becoming productive members of society once more.
This approach was a precursor to modern psychotherapy and recognized the potential for psychogenetic mental illness. In other words, shifts in medical thought allowed that mental disorders might well be psychological, and not merely physical, in origin. Under superintendants Todd and Amariah Brigham, MD, the Hartford Retreat strove to become a curative, rather than custodial, institution.
In its first 10 years, the Retreat boasted the highest cure rate in the nation and, possibly, the world. Such claims, however, were largely due to the fact that the definition of cured at the time meant a patient had progressed enough to be reintroduced into society; it did not necessarily indicate that a patient’s symptoms had ceased.
By 1843, when superintendant John S. Butler, MD, took control, the Hartford Retreat had already begun to change. Though the emphasis on moral treatment remained in place, the makeup of the patient population had shifted as the number of indigent insane in the state swelled due to the financial panic of 1837.
The number of individuals in Connecticut counted as insane tallied over 700 in 1838, and an increasing number of them were without adequate family care. Though efforts had been made to create a state-wide asylum for the insane poor, the political will was lacking until after the Civil War. In the short term, the Hartford Retreat, the only institution of its kind in the state, was expanded and began a much closer relationship with the state as it began to take state-subsidized insane poor as patients.
As the number of subsidized patients grew throughout the 1840s and ‘50s, the character of the Retreat changed, and so, too, did its financial state. The small, upper-class retreat with 50 beds that Eli Todd had known in the 1820s had become a sprawling institution by the time of the Civil War, and its curative focus had been replaced by a more custodial nature, as it housed an increasing number of chronically ill impoverished patients.
Butler spent much of his 30 year tenure at the Hartford Retreat trying to keep the facilities in line with Todd’s vision of kind care and tranquil surroundings, despite the institution’s ever worsening financial situation. Through charitable donations and some state aid, Butler was able to institute some recommended changes from Dorothea Dix, the noted mental healthcare reformer who had toured the facility in 1858. The improvements included more wings to ease overcrowding, a boiler to replace dangerous fireplaces throughout the facility, and gas lighting to brighten the halls. In 1860, the Hartford Retreat also hired Hartford native and renowned landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted to re-envision the hospital’s grounds.
The most important change for the Hartford Retreat came in 1868 when the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane opened in Middletown and took in the state’s chronically ill and impoverished insane. Relieved of being the sole institution able to assist this population, the Retreat quickly reverted back to an upper-class, resort-like facility. In the 20th century, the Hartford Retreat incorporated into Hartford Hospital as the Institute of Living and took on a more research-oriented and educational role in the now more advanced mental healthcare field.
Founded in 1822, The Institute of Living was one of the first mental health centers in the United States, and the first hospital of any kind on Connecticut. Located on 35 acres landscaped by Fredrick Law Olmstead, The Institute of Living lies near the center of Hartford, Connecticut.[1]

Givens. Givens was educated at the Eclectic Medical Institute in Cincinnati, and after graduation interned at the State Homoeopathic Insane Hospital (Middletown, NY) and the Westboro Insane Hospital (MA). He eventually settled in Stamford and established a sanitarium to treat mental disorders and substance addictions, including alcohol, opium, chloral and cocaine habits. Treatment included private nurses, baths, massage, hydrotherapy, faradic, galvanic, and static electricity.
When the hospital first opened, it consisted of only two cottages, but it quickly grew to be the largest private sanitarium in New England. The patient population in 1896 was 75 and by 1906 it was 250.
Stamford Hall became so renowned for its treatments and beautiful campus that it attracted many well-to-do clientele. As noted in Givens’ 1919 obituary: “Some of the most distinguished statesmen, lawyers, judges, clergy, writers and bankers in America have been patients here. Were the list made public, it would cause astonishment, for often when the public assumed that certain well known people were traveling abroad, or spending vacations in some out-of-the-way resort, they were under treatment here.”
One notable patient was Draper Daugherty, the son of the Attorney General under President Harding. Daugherty first made headlines in 1923 as a suspect in the murder of Broadway actress and socialite Dorothy “Dot” King. King was found dead in her New York City apartment “chloroformed to death.” Thousand dollars’ worth of jewelry was missing as well. Daugherty was an admirer of King. Though he was nowhere near New York City when King’s body was discovered, because he was married and was suddenly admitted to Stamford Hall fueled rumors that he was hiding something. Later that year, Daugherty escaped from Stamford Hall during a daily walk. He was first admitted to the hospital for alcoholism and quickly gained a reputation for being a “troublesome patient” after multiple escape attempts. Daugherty was never brought back to the hospital and King’s murder remains unsolved.

The first hospital building was opened in 1833 on seven-and-a-half acres of land between Cedar Street and Howard Avenue, and Davenport and Congress Avenues. The original 13-bed hospital, called the State Hospital, was designed by prominent New Haven architect Ithiel Town and cost $13,000.
Since it opened in 1826, the hospital was affiliated with the Medical Institution of Yale College, which had been founded in 1810. In 1884, the hospital's name was changed to New Haven Hospital. In 1917, the Yale School of Medicine and New Haven Hospital signed their first formal affiliation agreement, which marked the beginning of the modern medical center. In 1945, an affiliation with nearby Grace Hospital led to a name change: Grace-New Haven Hospital. In 1965, a more formal agreement with Yale officially created Yale-New Haven Hospital.
Founded as a charitable institution for the care of the poor, the role of the hospital soon expanded to include care for the entire community. In its early days, sailors from New Haven's busy seaport came to the hospital for care. During the Civil War, more than 25,000 U.S. Army soldiers were brought to the hospital, which temporarily changed its name to the Knight U.S. Army General Hospital. In subsequent wars, Yale-New Haven was on alert as a designated military hospital. The Yale-New Haven Psychiatric Hospital was opened in 2000, after the purchase of the Yale Psychiatric Institute. Before that time, the hospital operated a separate ""Insane Ward"" at the hospital.",,"New Haven, CT",,,1826,,13,,25000,0
Connecticut,Bridgeport Regional Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bridgeport_Regional_Center,1951,,1965,Demolished,Single Building,,The Kennedy Center,"Though the Kennedy Center was founded in 1951 by the Parents and Friend of the Mentally Retarded Stamford Connecticut, the facility on Virginia Avenue in Bridgeport was opened as the Bridgeport Regional Center in 1965.
In 1966, Clifford P. Lockyer, director of the Regional Center proposed a revolutionary idea for housing at the facility. A series of ranches or split level houses were to be constructed in October of that year, allowing patients to live away from their families in a supportive, group home environment. The units, diametrically opposed, would provide accommodations for a maximum of 16 people and would contain a kitchen, dining room, living room, and family area. In this housing arrangement, patients ""should be encouraged to assume responsibilities similar to thse discharged by large families.""  [1]
In 1974, the maximum daily cost per patient was raised by 25% to $130.36, by far the most expensive facility for mental health an mental retardation in the state. [2] The high costs restricted care to wealthier families, and the facility had many music and art therapy programs that other Connecticut centers did not. Eventually, the regional center split off into a second facility, run by the private organization The Kennedy Center.
The Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation took control of the facility some time in the 1980's.
The facility on Virginia Ave was demolished some time in the early 2000's. The Kennedy Center is still open, as well as the
""In 1943 Mrs. Evelyn Kennedy's first experience in hearing the term 'Mental Retardation' was when her doctor told her ""You have a mentally retarded son"". Their lives were centered on their son and they soon found out there was no place to turn for help, not even books in the library. When her son Brian was 5 she went to the Superintendent of Schools in Bridgeport only to be told there were no programs for children like hers. Special Classes were for children with IQ's over 50. There was no obligations for children like her son Brian.
On a snowy February night in 1951 12 families came together at Mrs. Kennedy's house to see what they could do for their children. They pleaded with the Board of Appropriations in Bridgeport to help them to keep their children home, and out of that came funds for two classes to start at Columbus School in Bridgeport. These trainable classes were the first of its kind in the New England States. They named their association 'The Parents and Friends of the Mentally Retarded' and held meetings twice a month.
Other communities wanted help in starting their parent groups so they traveled around the state in helping other groups get started. Their next need was a center for a nursery program. The Bridgeport Brass Good Neighbor Fund purchased a lot and with the money they had in their treasury designed and built a building with help from local contractors. It then took 18 months to complete it. Their programs soon expanded to their full capacity and it was time once again to move. The Mayor of Bridgeport gave them 3 acres of land on Virginia Ave. and Washington D.C. gave them a federal grant for $100,000. They also raised $375,000 to cover the cost of the new building. They realized all to soon, after the building opened, that they could not continue the expense, the demand was so intense for services, and it was overwhelming.
Their only alternative was to have the Department of Mental Retardation take the building over and provide the services desperately needed. Evelyn Kennedy made a trip to Hartford to insist that Bridgeport was past due in having a Regional Center. They then turned the building over to the DMR for $50,000 the amount owed on it. That was the beginning of the Bridgeport Regional Center. In 1951 they decided to take the older children and open another facility. They opened in one building, moved later to another one and finally to a factory building on Garden Street in Bridgeport that was donated to them. They also received a donation of about 1 million dollars to renovate the building and The Kennedy Center opened in the early 1970's.""[3]

Connecticut,Mansfield Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mansfield_Training_School,1909/1917,,1917 (merged),Closed,Cottage Plan,,Connecticut School for Imbeciles at Lakeville | Connecticut Training School for Feeble Minded at Lakeville | Connecticut Colony for Epileptics | Mansfield Training School and Hospital  | The Knight Hospital,"This history of Mansfield Training School is very similar to other institutions of its type. It originally started out as two separate institutions.
The Mansfield Training School was established in 1917 with the merging of two institutions, the Connecticut Colony for Epileptics and the Connecticut Training School for the Feeble Minded (previously known as the School for Imbeciles) ""to provide for the care, custody, education and employment of mental defective (feeble minded) and epileptic persons."" On its opening on July 1, 1917 there were 402 students in residence.
The population and campus steadily expanded for the next fifteen years. By 1932, there were 1,070 residents, 559 males, 511 females. However, the next decade was a trying time as the depression and World War II affected Mansfield Training School. Even as the institution reached and maintained its projected maximum population, the waiting list for entry increased to over a thousand prospective people, prompting the state to open Southbury Training School in the 1940s. Cuts in the operating budget, no construction on urgently needed buildings, the lack of adequate maintenance on contemporary equipment and buildings and insufficient staff strained the quality of the services.
The next few decades following the war were marked by changes at the school. The 1950s saw an increase in construction, which included the Longley School and four new dormitories with 152 beds each. However, chronic overcrowding continued to be a problem. The number of residents and the types of education and training increased. Residents worked in the print, wood working, weaving, and industrial shops. As the number of people who worked outside of the school increased they were also provided with more realistic job training.
A change in the attitude towards the mentally challenged became increasingly evident in the 1960s. There was an increase of the ratio of the number of staff to residents. In 1969 there were 1,609 residents and 875 full time staff. The size of the campus reached 1,000 acres and had 85 buildings. The administration sought to lessen the institutional aspects of life at the school and increase activity in things like the Special Olympics. The objective of the school also reflected this change, "". to rehabilitate as many retarded persons as possible so that they can return to the community as self-supporting citizens and . to assist other retarded persons …who do not have the capacity to return to the community, to become as happy and self sufficient as possible."" However, the staff was always challenged to provide quality care for such a large number of residents.
The next two decades continued the trend towards a less institutionalized attitude concerning the care and services for the mentally challenged. Cottages were created on campus and more people moved into group homes located in communities around the state. In 1976 the number of residents had dropped to 1,106. The facilities were old and the quality of care was questioned by family members of residents in a 1978 lawsuit, CARC v. Thorne that would eventually result in the closing of the school in 1993. However, the number of residents had been dropping steadily for years. Since 1984, an average of 80 men and women left the school each year. By 1991 there were 141 residents remaining. In 1993 the last buildings were closed as the last residents left for other accommodations. Some buildings were so dilapidated by this time that they were knocked down, other buildings were transferred to the use of other institutions such as the University of Connecticut and still others were abandoned.

Connecticut,New Haven Regional Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=New_Haven_Regional_Center,,,1965,Closed,Single Building,,New Haven Center for Retarded Children,"The New Haven Regional Center for the Mentally Retarded was opened in Fall of 1965 in New Haven Connecticut. It was opened alongside the Bridgeport Regional Center and a center in Putman Connecticut. Dr. Walter C. Alvarez wrote, in regard to the opening of the three new facilities, “experts are advocating the the building of small centers that will permit the retarded children to remain near his home, or even in it.”[1]
The facility housed children with moderate developmental disabilities and the average IQ of residents was 60. The center stressed the involvement of family and enrichment, preparing children for life outside of the facility.
In the summer of 1971, the first halfway house of the regional centers in Connecticut was established on Crown Street in New Haven. Eight women from New Haven Regional were transferred to the Marrakech group home, under the supervision of Dr. Seymour Sarason of the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic and New Haven Regional Center staff. The success of this pilot program sparked interest in similar facilities across the state.[2]
New Haven Regional Center closed in the summer of 1992. Patients from the center were moved into 36 group homes, along with the patients from Mansfield Training School.[3] The property now contains the New Haven Job Corps. Several buildings have been added since the closure of the center.

Its first young inhabitants were sent there as a remedy for their affliction as it was thought the fresh air and sunshine would be beneficial. In 1958 the tuberculosis program ended and in 1959 Seaside reopened as Seaside Geriatric Hospital. In Feb of 1961, admissions to Seaside Geriatric Hospital stopped. In May 1961, it was converted to Seaside Regional Center for the Mentally Retarded under the administration of the Dept. of Health and Office of Mental Retardation.
By 1996 the facility was closed. In 2016, the state of Connecticut announced plans to make the property a state park. The goal is “to expand shoreline recreational opportunities for state residents and visitors.” A few of the architecturally significant buildings are being renovated, and the grounds are being spruced up. Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration announced this week that it has ended its quest for a developer after two different proposals for the property failed to “sufficiently [meet] the criteria” set by state officials in 2019.
It was showcased in the expose book named: Christmas in Purgatory, A Photographic Essay on Mental Retardation, by Burton Blatt and Fred Kaplan. It was written to show the appalling condition in various state schools. The majority of the institutions shown in the book were not named. Yet, the last chapter within the book did name one institution: Seaside Regional Center. This institution was not named because of anything bad, but that it was an example of how state schools should be run. The book commented on how the staff really cared for the patients there and that there was never a real occasion of overcrowding like in other similar institutions.

Connecticut,Southbury Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Southbury_Training_School,1935,1938,1940,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"The Training School opened in 1940 as a Works Progress Administration project. It once was considered a model of client care, a place where people from across the country moved their sons and daughters. The population peaked at 2,300 in 1969. Private residences, were first part of the ""cottage campus"" vision in the 1940's WPA project. STS was a pioneer in this approach to residential placement for the developmentally disabled. However, in the 1970s government began moving away from institutionalization in favor of other care solutions and community-based support. Then, in 1984, the federal government sued the state of Connecticut over staff shortages and poor living conditions at STS. In 1986, the state decided to close STS to any new admissions. In 2006, the school was released from federal oversight after complying with all the improvement mandates outlined by the federal government. But the ban prohibiting new admissions still applied. A 2009 settlement called the Messier agreement decreed that severely intellectually disabled adults should be integrated with the community.
Currently, 359 people live at the school, down from a peak of about 2,000 in the 1960s. About 40 of those people are currently in the process of transitioning to community placement, such as private group homes. DDS has no set date for closing STS and there remains uncertainty over the future long term use of the site. In response to the declining resident population, STS is in the process of consolidating facilities within its campus. In 2013, the Connecticut General Assembly passed a bill preserving 825 acres of agricultural land on the west side of the campus.
From OLR Research Report:
Southbury Training School (STS) was established in the l930s as a home for persons with mental retardation. This state funded and operated facility has 125 buildings on a 1600-acre site. It independently operates its own power, heat, sewage treatment, water, laundry, fire, ambulance, public safety, building maintenance, transportation, and dietary services. Southbury residents participate in various day programs on and off campus. These include individual and group-supported employment at local businesses, employment at STS-operated ventures, job skills training, sheltered employment, and community experience and leisure programs.
According to the Department of Mental Retardation (DMR), 1700 employees (full time, part time, and consulting staff) provide medical, vocational, residential, and facility support services.
Admissions to STS closed in 1986 when 1,111 individuals lived there. Public Act 95-236 directed the DMR commissioner to (1) continue operating Southbury and 2) establish criteria to evaluate the school's population concerning community and training school placements. According to DMR, the goal of STS has been ""to provided community placement opportunities for those residents that wish to move and to ensure the best quality of services for residents who choose to remain at the facility.""
PA 97-8, June 18 Special Session, (CGS Sec. 17a-218a) prohibits the DMR commissioner from accepting any new admissions at STS.
A new director of STS, Fritz Gorst, was appointed in l999. He replaced co-directors Charles Hamad and George Moore. Previously, Gorst was an assistant facility director for both the Dever and Wrentham Development Centers, Massachusetts. Both facilities are state-operated institutions for individuals with mental retardation. Many of the decisions and actions undertaken by DMR concerning Southbury over the past 15 years have been the result of litigation.",,"Southbury, CT",,"2,300 in 1969",1940,,,1111,2300,0

This authorization followed a select legislative committee's report in 1850 that called for establishing a school for the “instruction, employment, and reformation of juvenile offenders.” It estimated that at least 200 boys a year could be classified as juvenile offenders who might be sent to the school. The legislature's actions were part of a national movement to find an alternative to imprisoning juveniles with adults.
The legislature appropriated $10,000 to establish the school, but these funds could not be spent until individuals contributed a matching amount. This was accomplished within a few years, and the school was
It opened in 1854 with 139 boys. Boys under age 16 who committed crimes could be committed to the school for a definite sentence, until they were reformed, or until they turned age 21. Over half of the boys in the school in 1856 had lost one or both parents, over half had either one or both parents deemed intemperate, and 20% had one or both parents in jail.
An eight-member board of trustees appointed by the legislature governed the school. The board hired the school's employees, which included a superintendent to administer daily operations, academic and vocational instructors, a chaplain, a steward, watchmen, and a farmer. The trustees could apprentice boys to farmers and mechanics; most of the boys who were discharged from the school left in this way. They could also remand incorrigible boys to a county sheriff or town constable for placement in a prison, jail, or workhouse.
The trustees intended the school to be a family as well as a school of detention and reformation. The boys worked six hours a day; spent four in school; prayed, played, or performed incidental duties for five hours; and had nine hours for sleep. They were housed in dormitories that were secured at night. The school's punishment philosophy called for graduated sanctions that began with denying recreation and rose, “when absolutely necessary,” to beating.
In 1921 Public Acts Chapter 336 set up the Juvenile Court System; the School for Boys and Long Lane School became juvenile detention centers for persons committed by the Juvenile Courts. By 1970, January 2, Public Act 69-664 it became part of the new Department of Children and Youth Services for administrative purposes.

Middletown won the small contest -- Farmington provided the only serious competition -- in part because of its easy access by steamer down the Connecticut River, and its position halfway between the major cities of Hartford and New Haven. The industrial school joined other institutions which had previously been located in Middletown: the small city already 
housed the Connecticut Valley Hospital for the Insane and Wesleyan University.
The Connecticut Industrial School for Girls celebrated its grand opening in June of 1870; the response showed large public support for the new institution. Twenty-four inmates, ""who, but for the school, would have been uncared for, and exposed to a terrible future,"" were already in residence at Middletown, and the superintendent expected the enrollment to soar past capacity levels. Contributors and dignitaries paraded around the grounds on a tour of the new buildings which had been funded by 
private donors, and listened to the words of several members of the new Board of Directors. The Connecticut Industrial School for Girls changed the ways in which state citizens thought about and dealt with female juvenile crime. The school became home to thousands of girls who would have otherwise slept in the street, at the county jail, or in an impoverished home.
In 1921 the state of Connecticut took over the school and changed the name to Long Lane Farm. Still a counterpart to the Reform School at Meriden, the institution continued to house delinquent girls. Gradual modifications in its program changed some of the goals of the school, and all of the old buildings were razed by the 1930s to make way for more modern structures. However, the basic program of removing potentially deviant children from their families and relocating them to a wholesome environment at the farm remained a constant and static feature of the institution.
By 1943 the state had changed the institution's name to the Long Lane School and in 1972, it Merged with the Connecticut School for Boys; all boys transferred from Meriden to the Long Lane facility. By 2003, the facility was closed as part of a state long-term plan to shutter all reform schools.
In late 2005, many of the Site buildings were razed. Wesleyan University currently operates administrative offices 
from the Cady School building, and grounds crews still utilize the maintenance garage and grounds workshop buildings. In March 2006, the University constructed an all-weather turf field in the area of the former high-security building on the east-central portion of the site. Future use of the Long Lane School Site will be for expansion of the Wesleyan University Campus.",2003,"Middletown, CT",,,1870,2003,,,,0
Connecticut,Blythewood Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Blythewood_Sanitarium,,,1890,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Blythewood Sanitarium opened as a private institution for the mentally disturbed in 1905 in Stamford, Connecticut. Established by Boss Tweed for wealthy patients as an escape from New York City, the facility was built on fifty acres of wooded land, split down the middle by a stream which lead to a nearby pond. At its peak, Blythewood had eight main buildings, eight cottages, a chapel, an occupational therapy building, and a small golf course.
Blythewood was not like the three other sanitariums of Greenwich (Brooklea Farm and Crest View). It was exclusive - catering to many wealthy socialites and costing nearly $200 a week in 1924. [1]
The patients were housed in four buildings. The main front building, described as a ""gracious mansion with white columns [2] was the original house of the estate. The administrative center contained doctors' offices and a ""graduate house"" for patients who were soon to be discharged.
The Forrest Building was the main residence and services building. It was three stories tall with clapboard siding, large brick chimneys at either end, and green awnings above the windows. There was also a medical facilities unit and the Occupational Building where patients could do arts and crafts or play piano.
According to an account from Mrs. Marty Mann, patients were sent into a ""lockup house"" for observation after being admitted. Violent patients were moved into the ""violent house,"" a small building far from the road. Patients would be sometimes be brought to this house in an ambulance and were restrained. Closer to the road was the ""middle house"". It had two floors, a finished attic, common rooms, and a small central dining room.""
Mann also accounts:
""Though the sanitarium had been established as primarily a psychiatric facility, its location in Greenwich was ironic regarding services to alcoholics. The town, a moneyed, educated, urbane bedroom community of New York City, had a reputation for widespread inebriety. As late as 1979, the problem of alcoholism was so pronounced that national study, reported in the Greenwich Time of July 30, 1979, called Greenwich the alcoholic capital of America, second only perhaps to the San Fernando Valley of California.""[3]
The facility closed some time in the 1960's and was demolished. The chapel was preserved, and still remains next to the Greenwich Baptist Church.

Connecticut,Dr. Barnes Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dr._Barnes_Sanitarium,,1894,,,Cottage Plan,,Grey Towers,"1916 Description; This Sanitarium was organized in 1894 by an act of the Legislature. Subsequently in 1898, when it became The Dr. Barnes Sanitarium, it was licensed under a new act which applied to all the institution of the state.
The sanitarium is situated in a park of 50 acres on high ground overlooking Long Island Sound. The buildings are six in number. They are so arranged that patients can be classified in a thorough manner. A farm is connected which gives an abundant supply of vegetables and fruit. It also gives the opportunity for out-of-door work by the patients.
Among the special features of treatment are freedom from bars and bolts, and the insistence on proper physical exercise in the open air.
The medical superintendent is Dr. F. H. Barnes, who for the past five years has been connected with the neurological department of the New York Post-Graduate Hospital, and is neurologist to the Stamford Hospital.[1]
The institution was built approximately two miles out of the city of Stamford, on a twenty five acre plot of land. A single grey stone house was designated for the treatment of alcoholics and narcotic addicts, as well as mild cases of mental disease. A small cottage nearby housed several female patients of low income.
The main building was a three story wooden structure, where men were housed on the second floor and women patients on the third. The building was ""heated by hot air furnaces and powered by electricity."" A fourth building, an annex for violent male patients, and those of ""lower means"" was located near the main building. The facility held 60 patients in 1898.[2]",,"Stamford, CT",,60,1894,,,60,,0

Winding through the roads toward the visitor parking, however, it begins to feel more and more removed from the surrounding office complex. Rippowam River is visible, along with open fields that, covered with snow, still resemble the postcards on record at the
This property was once home to ""Dr. Givens' Sanitarium for the Treatment of Nervous and Mental Diseases, Opium and Alcoholic Habitues."" It was established in 1891 and later known by the more discreet name of Stamford Hall. For years, Stamford Hall specialized in ""the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as habit conditions."" The proximity to New York City and the Long Island Sound was advertised in brochures, as was the climate, which was described as ""exceptionally mild in winter. The snowfall is much less than at many points further south.""
One startlingly, light-hearted anecdote from February 1908 was written up in ""The New York Times."" An administration building at Stamford Hall was destroyed in a fire — all 12 patients in that building and 60 in a nearby building were safely evacuated. ""The New York Times"" reported that a man from New York had not spoken since entering the hospital but ""excited by the fire, he spoke freely, and seemed to throw off the melancholia. The physicians say there is a chance that the improvement will be permanent.""
Other newspaper articles from the time tell of escapes from Stamford Hall, including patients who made their way into New York City or headed west. Other articles report on prominent citizens admitted to the hospital after suffering nervous breakdowns. In 1923, Draper Daugherty, son of U.S. Attorney General Harry Daugherty, had himself voluntarily committed.
Givens died in 1919, but the hospital continued to operate until 1965. The land was reportedly sold in 1965, including Givens' property across Long Ridge Road that is now.[1]
Dr. Given's Sanatorium was built for the care ""nervous, mental diseased, alcoholic, and drug patients."" in Stamford, Connecticut. The institution consisted of 16 buildings and was run by Amos J. Givens, M.D. [2]

It was erected and established as Meriden Sanatorium in 1910 to serve children with tuberculosis. In 1922/1924 the name was changed to Undercliff Sanatorium. In 1939, the hospital began accepting adults. The large hospital, the Administration and Infirmary Building, was constructed by Kane and Fairchild. A nurses building, with a matching front facade to the hospital, was constructed next to the Administrative and Infirmary Building, and a children's isolation ward was constructed several years later at the bottom of Undercliff Road. In 1967 the name was changed from Undercliff Sanatorium to Undercliff Mental Health Center. As of 1976, the facility was discontinued. Several properties on the campus are used for storage for the Department of Developmental Services of Connecticut, as well as the Welfare Department, and the Department of Youth and Children Services. A detention center for the DDS still runs on the campus, housing violent developmentally disabled adults.
Demolition of the campus to make way for a juvenile courthouse began in October of 2013. The recreation section of the Administration and Infirmary Building was demolished, followed by the rear portion of the hospital. Current plans for the other buildings, currently used for storage, are unknown.
