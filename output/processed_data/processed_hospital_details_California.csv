California,Agnews State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Agnews_State_Hospital,,1885.0,1889,Active,Kirkbride Plan,,Agnews Insane Asylum | Agnews Developmental Center,"Today known as the world famous Sun Microsystems/Agnews Developmental Center, the campus-like setting of the former Agnews Insane Asylum consists of a grouping of numerous reinforced concrete, brick, stucco and tile buildings. They are constructed in large rectangular-shaped plans and designed in a Mediterranean Revival style. The buildings are formally placed within a landscaped garden of palms, pepper trees and vast lawns. The treatment of the insane in California dates from the earliest days of the Gold Rush. The first provisions for the insane were to lock them up with criminals in the ship Ephemia, purchased in 1849 by the City of San Francisco, and later to house them at the San Francisco marine hospital in 1850, used primarily for ailing seamen. In 1885 the Agnews Residential Facility was established by the California State Legislature as a neuropsychiatric institution for the care and treatment of the mentally ill. Agnews, opened in 1889, was the third institution in the state established for the mentally ill. Twenty-one years later, the greatest tragedy of the 1906 earthquake in Santa Clara County took place at the old Agnews State Hospital. The multistory, unreinforced masonry building crumbled, killing over 100 patients.
The Institution was then redesigned in, what was then, a revolutionary cottage plan spreading the low-rise buildings along tree-lined streets in a manner that resembled a college campus. The Mediterranean Revival style buildings were constructed of concrete with tile roofs, decorative tile patterns, rustic wooden balconies, porch columns and banisters. Bands of decorative tile patterns reflect the Hispanic influence on the buildings. Now at the center of the Sun Microsystems/Agnews complex is the Clock Tower Building (formerly the Treatment Building) with its massive symmetrical clock tower. The auditorium is an outstanding building, which seems as beautiful today as it was in 1913. Agnews State Hospital was significant as the first modern mental hospital in California, and subsequently other State facilities, followed the example of Agnews. It embodied the distinctive characteristics of a progressive mental hospital in the early 20th century as it was intended to be a ""cheerful"" place with its decentralized specialized buildings for different treatment purposes and different types of patients. Its small, low-scale buildings were designed to bring light and air to patients.
After World War II, new approaches to treatment had an effect on hospital operations and facilities. Among the most important new approaches were the establishment of community clinics, treatment outside of hospitals, and treatment of the developmentally disabled at State Hospitals formerly intended for the mentally ill. A watershed event was the passage of the 1971 Laterman Act, which resulted in closing of several State hospitals and restructuring of the State system. Since that time there has been an increasing move toward closing hospitals and reliance on community treatment programs.
In 1996, the State of California put up for sale 90 acres of the surplus State land (the former site of Agnews Developmental Center). Intense community interest in the future of the site made decisions about the development of the land a challenge. To foster the site's preservation, Agnews Hospital was listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its historic and architectural significance. Sun Microsystems invested $10 million in the restoration of key historic buildings on the property where it built its corporate headquarters, office/research and development space for more than 3,000 employees. This project was a first of its kind; in which a city, community and corporation share, in an interactive way, a work environment and a public environment. Two of the restored historic buildings, the auditorium and the mansion, are available for cultural and social events by community groups on evenings and weekends. Most of the major stands of heritage trees around the historic buildings were preserved and the park-like grounds beautified and maintained for the use of local residents. Local historical groups worked with Sun to refurbish a small local history museum inside the auditorium, the historic Agnews cemetery and a monument to victims of the 1906 earthquake. Smaller residential buildings from the original Agnews Hospital complex are being relocated and will become part of an affordable housing project on another portion of the State surplus land. The site also includes 100+ year-old trees, historically a habitat for the protected species of burrowing owls. Worries about this owl population were overcome when the State agreed to purchase a suitable habitat for the owls and deed it to the California Department of Fish and Game for perpetual management. Both Sun and the City helped to finance the acquisition of this new home for burrowing owls. The auditorium and mansion have been used for many public events since their restoration was completed including performances by the community ballet, chorale, symphony and drum and bugle corps.[1]
In 2014, the Santa Clara Unified School District purchased the property with intent to build three schools on the site. As of May 2024, three schools have been built on the property including an elementary school, middle school, and high school. [2]

In the 1906 earthquake, the main treatment building collapsed, crushing 112 residents and staff under a pile of rubble. The victims were buried in a mass grave on the asylum cemetery grounds. The Institution was then redesigned with low-rise buildings that resembled a college campus. According to the information from DDS there are 607 documented burials here from 1889-1906.

ASH opened in 1954 and is a completely self-contained psychiatric hospital constructed within a security perimeter. ASH has a licensed capacity of 1275 beds, of which 204 are acute/psychiatric and 1071 are intermediate care. All residents at Atascadero State Hospital are male and have a mental disability and pose a threat to others or themselves. The majority are remanded for treatment by the superior courts of the counties of California or by the Department of Corrections pursuant to various sections of the California Penal Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code. Individuals are admitted from state prisons, county jails or are transferred from other state hospitals. The hospital does not accept voluntary admissions.
As a public sector facility, ASH's mission is linked to public policy. ASH has undergone a number of changes due to shifting public, professional, and legislative policy and law regarding the relationship between crime and mental disorders. The hospital's current mission includes the provision of a secure environment that protects the community as well as the people within the hospital, evaluations to the courts and other agencies, and recovery-focused treatment and rehabilitation services.",,"Atascadero, CA",,,1954,,1275,,,0
California,Camarillo State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Camarillo_State_Hospital,,1932.0,1936,Closed,Cottage Plan,,"Camarillo State Mental Hospital | California State University, Channel Islands","Camarillo State Mental Hospital, also known as Camarillo State Hospital, was a psychiatric hospital for both developmentally disabled and mentally ill patients in Camarillo, California. The hospital closed in 1997. The site has been redeveloped as the California State University, Channel Islands. The University has retained the distinctive Mission Revival Style architecture, and the distinctive bell tower in the South quad is now the symbol of the university.
In 1932, the State of California purchased 1,760 acres (7.1 km2) of the Lewis ranch, located three miles south of the city of Camarillo, and established the Camarillo State Mental Hospital. Camarillo State Hospital was in use from 1936 to 1997. During its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, the hospital was at the forefront of treating illnesses that previously had been thought of as untreatable. An example of this was the drug and therapy procedures the facility's doctors developed for schizophrenia. Many of these programs initiated at Camarillo helped patients formerly relegated to a lifetime of warehousing in an institution or lobotomies be able to leave the hospital and move to less restrictive group homes or become (at least nearly) independent. The hospital continued to be a leader in the research of drugs and therapies in subsequent years. They also had one of the first units of any hospital to deal with autism.
Due to its low patient number and the rising costs per patient, the governor of California at the time, Republican Pete Wilson, announced in January 1996 plans to close down the hospital in July 1997. Various members of the community, family members of patients, and employees of Camarillo made several last-ditch efforts to keep the hospital open, arguing in part that the patients are already used to Camarillo and questioned where they would go. Some tried to get mentally ill criminals placed in Camarillo in an effort to save it, a proposal that had come up several times before, but again community members were concerned of the risk of criminals escaping into the community. Pete Wilson ended up standing his ground and the hospital closed down in late June 1997, with the patients and research facilities moved to other locations.
Originally it was intended to turn Camarillo into a prison, but community opposition in part and interest from the Cal State Universities led to its conversion into a university- California State University, Channel Islands (CSUCI). CSUCI had its first classes in fall 2002, four years ahead of the original schedule. Most of the buildings of Camarillo have been preserved and revitalized, including all the original 1930s mission-style buildings. The university is Ventura County's first public university and is quickly becoming a destination university. It had 2,300 students in 2006, but is expected to grow to 15,000 by 2025.
In 1976, a nurse under the name of Nadine Scolla published a diary she had kept while working in Camarillo State Hospital, this set of a chain of events leading to investigations related to the allegations of abuse from the book. The book titled ""Keeper of the Keys"", told of gold fillings pulled out of new patients' mouths and other acts of abuse or by the staff who were often aware and desensitized to the issues going on inside. Due to the nature of the novel, the book was barred from publishing several times and the author was later found dead in her after a home invasion all of this was later detailed in newer editions of the book.

California,DeWitt State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=DeWitt_State_Hospital,,1943.0,1947,Closed,Cottage Plan,,DeWitt General Hospital,"The following information was obtained from Hospital Annual Reports on former DeWitt General Hospital for the years 1943 through 1945. Construction of former DeWitt General Hospital was approved on 25 March 1943, with a tentative completion date set for 15 November 1943. The hospital was activated as Auburn General Hospital on 15 August 1943 per Headquarters, Ninth Service Command General Order 96, dated 12 August 1943. It was designated DeWitt General Hospital per War Department General Order 48, dated 24 August 1943 and confirmed by General Order 122, Headquarters, Ninth Service Command, dated 4 October 1943. DeWitt General Hospital officially opened on 27 February 1944. Its function was ""to receive and treat war casualties as well as those from the Zone of Interior posts, camps, and stations""
The hospital initially furnished general hospital treatment for the Reno Army Air Base, Chico Army Air Field, Camp Beale, Camp Kohler, McClellan Field, and the Sierra Ordnance Depot. With cessation of the war and a large influx of overseas patients, DeWitt General Hospital was relieved of a majority of Zone of Interior patients with the exception of their own duty personnel. DeWitt General Hospital ""was designated a hospital center for the care of neurosurgery, vascular (both medical and surgical), neuropsychiatry (both open and closed ward), general and orthopedic surgery, in addition to general medical type of patients"".
A Dental Branch was present at the hospital as well. In 1944, DeWitt General Hospital was temporarily selected as an amputation center, but the idea was abandoned due to a lack of space and a shortage of equipment and trained personnel. Hospital occupancy peaked on 30 August 1945 with 2,310 patients.
DeWitt General Hospital was declared surplus on 31 December 1945 and the War Assets Administration (WAA) assumed custody of the Site on 24 June 1946. The Site was conveyed to the State of California by quitclaim deed executed on 15 March 1947. As a part of this conveyance four conditions had to be met. According to the first, for a period of 25 years from the date of this conveyance, the property had to be continuously used as and for a mental institution. The second condition stated the premises could not be resold or leased within the first 25 years without authorization from the WAA. The third condition listed the reporting requirements for the state. Finally, the fourth condition was the procedures to be followed if the first three conditions could not be met. The deed states that all and singular tenements, hereditaments, and appurtenances were transferred to the State of California. According to the State Archive's Online Archive of California, the hospital began receiving patients in early 1947.
Initially, DeWitt State Hospital could only receive patients on transfer due to overcrowding in other state mental hospitals. It was equipped to receive both mentally ill and mentally deficient patients. DeWitt State Hospital became a permanent hospital in July 1950, when it began receiving first admissions directly from local communities, including the counties of Modoc, Lassen, Sierra, Yuba, Sutter, Placer, and El Dorado. The hospital had exceeded its rated capacity with over 2,800 patients by 1960, but the number of patients subsequently declined until DeWitt State Hospital was closed in 1972. The federal government deed restrictions expired on 15 March 1972. Correspondence from the Office of Surplus Property Utilization, California Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, stated that upon completion of the 25-year use of the property as a mental institution, it was the intention of the Administration to transfer the property to the County of Placer for further public use, effective 1 April 1972.
Assembly Bill No. 1748, dated 12 April 1972, created the DeWitt Hospital Authority Act to be administered by the Placer County Board of Supervisors. The act made the transfer to the County of Placer, at no cost to the county, in a manner agreeable to the county. If the county ceases to use the property for public purposes, the property will revert to the state. This act was an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution, and it went into immediate effect. The act was made necessary because it is imperative in terms of maintenance and operation of expensive machinery and facilities that the machinery and facilities not be allowed to sit idle. During a regular meeting, the Board of Supervisors, County of Placer, State of California, accepted Resolution No: 72-392 on 27 June 1972. By acceptance of this Resolution, the County of Placer consented to the acceptance and recordation of the attached deed, and accepted for public purposes the real property, or interest therein or easements thereon.
Currently, the majority of the Site is known as the DeWitt Government Center. It serves as the primary government center for Placer County. The Placer County Jail and Juvenile Detention Facility are present south of B Avenue and west of Richardson Drive. In addition, several professional services Land surrounding the Site is developed for residential, commercial, and professional use.[1]",1972,,,,1944,1972,,,2310,0
California,Mendocino State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mendocino_State_Hospital,1889.0,1891.0,1893,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Ukiah State Hospital,"Mendocino State Hospital, originally the Mendocino State Asylum for the Insane, was established in 1889 (Statutes 1889, Ch. 23). By that law the Governor was authorized to appoint a board of directors of five members for a term of four years to select the site and to manage the institution. In October 1890, contracts were let out for the construction of the male ward building, connecting corridor, kitchen building, laundry, bakery, and the boiler and engine house. The contract for these buildings was for $182,520. On the 26th of January, 1891, contracts were let out for the female building for $89,025,. Three months later, in April 1891, construction began on the hospital. Additional funds were allocated for completion of mentioned buildings, including $60,000 for construction of the administration building.
In 1893, the hospital was renamed as the Mendocino Asylum (Statutes 1893, Ch. 64). With the Insanity Law of 1897, the hospital took on the name of Mendocino State Hospital. The Insanity Law created the State Commission on Lunacy which was given authority to see that all laws relating to care and treatment of patients were carried out and to make recommendations to the Legislature concerning the management of hospitals for the insane. The 1897 law provided that each hospital should be controlled by a board of managers of five members appointed by the Governor for four year terms. On December 12 1893, the Hospital was finished and opened to patients, receiving 60 from Napa State Hospital this same day. Two days later 60 more arrived from Stockton State Hospital and on March 25 30 from Agnews State Hospital, bringing the population to 150.
In 1921, the state hospitals were placed under the authority of the newly-created Dept. of Institutions. The board of managers continued, but only with advisory power. The Dept. of Mental Hygiene was created by an act of the Legislature in 1945 (Statutes 1945, Ch. 665). It was given authority over all state mental institutions. Boards of managers were replaced by boards of trustees with no change in function. Advisory boards were established in 1969 to take over the responsibilities of the trustees.
Following the stock market crash in the late 1920s, patient population increased rapidly. By 1932, the hospital had over 1900 patients and 300 employees. By 1935, the figure had risen to over 2600 patients. Hospital population hit a high in 1955 at over 3,000 patients and 700 employees. Increasing discharges and transfer of the criminally insane to the Atascadero facility eased overcrowding. By 1966, population was back under 1800 patients.
Building construction occurred in spurts over the years. The original main building, completed in 1893, was razed in 1952. With the exception of two wards built in 1910 and 1918, the first major construction project took place between 1925-1933. Little construction was accomplished in the 1940s. Between 1950-55, many new major structures were completed to replace old buildings and to provide facilities for new programs.
Major programs over the years have included treatment for the criminally insane (1929-54), alcoholic and drug abuse rehabilitation, a psychiatric residency program, industrial therapy, and others. As part of a major reorganization by the Reagan administration, the hospital was closed in 1972.
The property was sold and its 488-acre grounds were transformed into the City of 10,000 Buddhas, one of the Western Hemisphere’s largest Buddhist communities. The buildings of the former mental hospital remain. Painted in a soft yellow, the warehouse-like structures have been repurposed. They now serve as a temple and monastery, university, dining hall and dorms, elementary and secondary schools, and a bookstore and gift shop.

Almost immediately after acquiring the first parcel of land, the USACE began building the 2,540 bed general hospital using standard Quartermaster Corps (who had the U.S. Army’s general construction mission prior to 4 December 1941) and USACE 700-, 800-, and 1100-series plans for wood framed wards, clinics, barracks, and support buildings. On the eastern portion of the hospital, a cantonment area using mostly TOS-series buildings was constructed for hospital patient and garrison overflow as well as for Army Ground Forces units training at the hospital. Hammond General Hospital specialized in neurology, general and orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery and psychiatry. On 6 March 1943, the hospital was designated as one of five thoracic surgery centers, and the only one on the West Coast. The center remained at Hammond General Hospital until August 1944 when it was transferred to Baxter General Hospital in Spokane, Washington. Hammond General Hospital also maintained six “detention wards” for the mentally ill and a prison ward, all of which were surrounded by security fencing.
In addition to the hospital’s permanent garrison, Service Command Unit (SCU) 1975, at least two Army Ground Forces units, the 47th and 77th Field Hospitals, were stationed at Hammond General Hospital prior to their deployment overseas. SCU 1975 was subordinate to the Army Service Forces’ 9th Service Command headquartered at Fort Douglas, Utah.
By 1945, the Hammond General Hospital was a 2,556-bed facility with approximately 240 buildings and other structures, including 78 wards, clinics, barracks, offices, warehouses, 6 mess halls, pump houses, and utility shops. The building inventory is presented in Table 3-2 and the general layout is shown in figures 3-1 through 3-5.

This information is included in this report for operational history purposes only and this site is not otherwise included in this report.
In December 1945 Hammond General Hospital was closed by the U.S. Army. With the closing of the hospital, the State of California set its eyes on the facility as a possible state mental hospital. On 20 December 1945, Governor Earl Warren sent a telegraph to the Federal Surplus Property Administration (after March 1946, the War Assets Administration (WAA)) expressing an interest in acquiring the former Hammond General Hospital for that purpose. On 9 April 1946, the USACE reported the Site as surplus to the needs of the U.S. Army to the WAA who assumed jurisdiction over the Site.
In a letter dated 19 April 1946 to Lieutenant General E.B. Gregory, Chairman of the WAA; General Omar N. Bradley, Director of the Veterans Administration, waived any claim to the hospital, thus clearing the way for the State of California to obtain the Site. On 17 November 1946, the WAA granted a Right of Entry to the State of California to begin the process of converting the former Hammond General Hospital into a state hospital pending a formal transfer of the facility. Through the WAA, the former Hammond General Hospital and its assets (i.e., medical and support equipment) were quitclaim deeded to the State of California on 20 October 1947, who operated it as the Modesto State Hospital under the Department of Mental Hygiene (After 1971, Department of Mental Health) until 1970. By 1963, the hospital was reorganized to receive only the mentally ill. In that same year, Modesto's population exceeded its rated capacity of 2,369.
On 6 and 10 August 1970, the State of California respectively quitclaimed the former Hammond General Hospital/Modesto State Hospital to the Yosemite Junior College District and the County of Stanislaus. On 17 March 1947 and 12 October 1978, the County of Stanislaus quitclaimed two parcels to the Yosemite Junior College District. The Yosemite Junior College District developed their portions of the Site into the West Campus of Modesto Junior College.

The hospital originated due to overcrowded conditions at the Stockton Asylum, the first State Hospital. The doors of the unfinished entrance of Napa State Hospital opened on Monday, November 15, 1875, to the first individuals, two San Franciscans.
Initially, 192 acres of land were purchased for $11,506 from Don Cayetano Juarez. These acres were part of the Mexican Land Grant, Rancho Tulocay, received from General Mariano Vallejo. Additional land was acquired over the years bringing the total to over 2,000 acres. The land extended from a wharf on the Napa River to the eastern edge of Skyline Park, allowing for the development of dairy and poultry ranches, vegetable gardens, orchards and other farming operations necessary to make the hospital as self-sufficient as possible. Farming operations ceased in the late 1960's. Napa Valley College, Kennedy Park and Skyline Wilderness Park now occupy most of this land.
The population peaked in 1960 with over 5,000 individuals in residence and then steadily declined with the arrival of psychotropic medications and the development of county based programs. Treatment programs for developmentally disabled residents were operant from October 1968, to August 1987, and from October 1995, to March 2001.[1]

Used as a cemetery for indigent patients from about 1875 through the 1924, an eastern portion of the campus holds 4,368 bodies. Although it was once dotted with wooden grave markers, today an outbuilding and a calf barn that hasn’t been used for decades sit atop the seemingly empty field. From the early to mid-1920s through the early 1960s, patients no longer were buried on hospital grounds, and no bodies were ever exhumed from Napa State grounds. Because burial acreage was limited, an on-site crematorium was built at Napa State in the mid-1920s and was in use until sometime in the 1960s. Remains of patients who died between about 1924 and 1965 were moved from Napa State to Inspiration Chapel & Napa Valley Memorial Park.

California,Norwalk State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norwalk_State_Hospital,1915.0,,1916,Active,Cottage Plan,,Metropolitan State Hospital,"A study by a group of Los Angeles County Psychiatrists projected that with the area’s population growth and overcrowding at Patton State Hospital there was a need for a second Los Angeles area hospital. On June 7, 1913, based on this study, Governor Hiram Johnson signed Senate Bill No. 739 appropriating authority and funds to create a second state hospital in Southern California for the reception and treatment of California’s increasing population of persons with psychiatric disabilities, alcohol and drug addiction. Three hundred and five acres of land in Norwalk were purchased for $90,000 after a selection committee had inspected twenty Southern California sites and considered forty separate proposals. The three top contenders for the new facility were Beverly Hills, Signal Hill and Norwalk. Signal Hill in Long Beach was rejected because the sea air was not perceived as healthful as the country air in Norwalk. In addition, the climate was damp and foggy, and it was difficult to access. The decision to place the hospital in Norwalk was prompted primarily due to its location, with easy access to good roads and railroad service. At the time, Norwalk was a very large and popular resort area that was used seasonally because of its clean, healthy air, mild temperatures, mineral baths, Railroad Station as well as being the “in place” to have a cottage.
On February 15, 1916, the State Lunacy Commission opened Norwalk State Hospital with 105 patients on Wards 2 and 4 with 21 employees, including one physician. Many of these patients most likely had a syphilis induced psychosis and were termed luetic patients, meaning a patient who was affected by syphilis. These first patients were noted to be “accommodating male patients of a quiet working class” and were transferred by rail and buckboard from Patton State Hospital (PSH) in Patton, CA. Those that came by buckboard, a four-wheeled horse drawn wagon, reportedly camped along the way for rest stops. These patients later assisted hospital staff with the building and development of the original construction located between Circle Drive and what has become Bloomfield Avenue. Circle Drive was planned as a frontage road for a cottage style hospital with separate buildings as opposed to one large complex modeled in the Kirkbride tradition which was devised for the Moral Treatment of mentally ill patients.
Many changes have taken place since the opening of Norwalk State Hospital on February 15, 1916 including the development of psychotropic medications, increased therapies and improved standards of care. On September 9, 1953 a voluntary name change to Metropolitan State Hospital was requested so as to represent the service area and not the geography of the hospital’s location. In 2012 the Department of State Hospitals (DSH) was formed to streamline the state hospital system. The hospital was renamed DSH-Metropolitan at that time and is one of five existing state hospitals in California. Today DSH-Metropolitan has a daily census of approximately 750 patients and approximately 1,400 employees.
The facility celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 15, 2016. To commemorate the occasion, the facility opened a Mental Health Museum, unveiled a ceramic tiled Centennial Wall, sponsored an all day mental health conference, provided a retiree/alumni tea and social, and facilitated multiple patient events.

California,Patton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Patton_State_Hospital,1890.0,1893.0,1893,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),,Highland Insane Asylum | Southern California State Hospital  | Southern California State Homeopathic Hospital  | Highland State Hospital,"Patton State Hospital is a major forensic mental hospital operated by the California Department of Mental Health. It is located in San Bernardino, California, a community of approximately 181,000 people. The hospital was first opened in August 1, 1893. In 1927 it was renamed Patton State Hospital after a member of the first Board of Managers, Harry Patton of Santa Barbara.
Patton State Hospital is currently a forensic hospital with a licensed bed capacity of 1287 for individuals who have been committed by the judicial system for treatment. Currently the hospital is fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of HealthCare Organizations (JCAHO). The Joint Commission's Board of Commissioner's approved a proposal to conduct all regular accreditation surveys on an unannounced basis beginning January 2006. Joint Commission standards deal with organizational quality of care issues and the safety of the environment in which care is provided.
The hospital currently provides psychiatric care and treatment to judicially committed, mentally disordered adult individuals. The Individuals served are assigned to a living unit, which is part of one of the seven Treatment Programs. The hospital is currently going through changes regarding how treatment is provided to the Individuals we serve. Currently treatment is delivered through a centralized approach, where the Individuals served and the staff, from throughout the Hospital, come together to participate in services within Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PSR) Malls. Mall interventions are provided, as much as possible, in the context of real-life functioning and in the rhyme of life of the Individual. Thus, a PSR mall extends beyond the context of a building or place and its services are based on the needs of the Individual, not the needs of the program, the staff members or the institution.
PSR Mall are designed to insure that each Individual receives intensive and individual services to promote his/her increased wellness and ability to thrive in the world. All decisions regarding what is offered through each mall are driven by the needs of the Individuals served. Mall services are provided in an environment that is culturally sensitive and strength based. The concept of recovery shall be the guiding principal and operation framework for the mall system.
Each Individual served has a treatment team that they work with in developing the individual Wellness and Recovery Plan. The teams include a Psychiatrist, Psychologist, Social Worker, Rehabilitation Therapist, Registered Nurse, and Psychiatric Technician.
Patton State Hospital is located at the base of the San Bernardino mountains, 60 miles east of Los Angeles and 60 miles west of the low desert Palm Springs resort area. A diversity of attractions characterize San Bernardino, seat of the largest land mass county in the United States. The City of San Bernardino houses the California Theater of Performing Arts, a civic light opera, the San Bernardino Symphony Orchestra, diverse outdoor recreation and major air transportation access. Housing costs in San Bernardino are substantially lower than those of many other Southern California urban areas. Year-round mountain recreation is only thirty minutes away in the 11,000 foot high San Bernardino range which includes the popular ski resorts of Mt. Baldy, Big Bear, and Wrightwood. Lake Arrowhead offers year-round recreation and aquatic sports, blending the quaint charm of this mountain village with a modern entertainment and shopping complex. To the northeast is the serenely beautiful California high desert, the Mojave, with Las Vegas less than a four hour drive. [1]
In 1889 the California legislature approved the construction of Patton in order to provide care to those deemed mentally ill in southern California. The Grand Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons of California laid the cornerstone of the original building on December 15, 1890.  At the time of its establishment, Patton was seen as a state-of-the-art mental healthcare facility designed along the Kirkbride plan; a popular plan for large asylums in the 19th century. The Kirkbride, as the main building was called, was an elaborate and grandiose structure with extensive grounds which was meant to promote a healthy environment in which to recover.
The Kirkbride model was designed by Thomas Story Kirkbride, an asylum superintendent and one of the founders of the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Asylums for the Insane, the precursor to the American Psychiatric Association. Kirkbride’s book, On the Construction, Organization and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane, published in 1854, became the standard resource on the design and management of asylums in the mid to late 19th century.  The Kirkbride plan consisted of a linear design with a central administration building and long wings on either side that radiated off the center building. This design allowed for “maximum separation of the wards, so that the undesirable mingling of the patients might be prevented.”  The wings also allowed for separation of male and female patients, and for separation of patients based on the severity of their illnesses.  Patton’s Kirkbride was one of the last hospitals designed along this plan. The next California state hospital to be built, Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, was opened in 1916 and, from its establishment, was built along the ward and cottage system. It did not include a Kirkbride building.
Patton opened and received its first patients on August 1, 1893, under the name Southern California State Asylum for the Insane and Inebriates. The name would later change to Patton State Hospital in 1927 and was renamed after Harry W. Patton, a member of the board of supervisors.  Patton was designed to be a homeopathic hospital but there was little staff could do to treat or cure patients with mental illness at the time. Patton’s first superintendent, M.B. Campbell, was hired to head the hospital because he was a doctor of homeopathic medicine.  In 1897 a Lunacy Law was passed in California that created a Commission in Lunacy to oversee the state hospital system. This law also changed the name of its state “asylums” to state “hospitals.”  
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many working class families often brought about the confinement of their own “disturbed and disturbing relatives and neighbors. The insane, the poor, the delinquent, and the criminal were... a formidable burden to their own families and neighborhoods.”  State institutions provided a means for families and neighbors to unburden themselves at little to no cost. The state hospitals were funded entirely by the state and, because there were no community-based treatments available for those deemed insane, the state hospitals were the only option for commitment and care of the mentally ill. In addition, counties and communities found it easy to send troublesome individuals who might be afflicted with a mental illness to the state hospitals and, from the 1870s to the 1920s, “California had the highest rate of insane commitments in the nation.”  This resulted in one in every 281 Californians being committed to a state hospital by the turn of the century, leading all the hospitals to be overcrowded for nearly their entire histories up to the late 20th century. Massive immigration to California and a relatively unsettled locale likely contributed to this trend.
By 1904 Patton had over 800 patients.  To ease overcrowding, the state hospitals in California used deportation, parole, probation, and sterilization as the means to reduce patient populations.  The need to release patients was a driving factor behind California’s trend of sterilizing over 11,000 mentally ill state hospital patients from the passage of its Asexualization Act in 1909 through 1950. Sterilizations at Patton made up nearly half of that total at 4,585 patient sterilizations.  No other state in the U.S. sterilized as many people as the state of California. Some medical practitioners believed that sterilization of mental patients was therapeutic, but most doctors who were involved in sterilizing patients did it for eugenic purposes. It was thought that sterilizing patients would keep them from passing on their illnesses to their progeny and would keep future generations from further overcrowding the hospitals.  Sterilization of mental patients would decrease dramatically after World War II, but would not officially end in California until 1979.
Patton’s grounds were expanded in the first decade of the twentieth century to include a 400 acre farm and ranch which provided nearly all the food the hospital required to feed its patients and staff. Patton had a dairy, piggery, and chicken farm by 1916, and grew almost all its own fruits and vegetables, had orchards, and eventually built a cannery. The hospital also constructed several industrial shops in its early decades and this further contributed to the hospital’s trend of self-sustainment. Patton added a mattress shop, shoe shop, furniture shop, and sewing room in 1912. Most patients worked alongside the staff on the farms and ranches, and in the shops, laundry, and kitchen. This was seen as therapeutic and came to be referred to as occupational or industrial therapy. As a self-sufficient town, Patton also had its own post office and, to this day, has its own postal code.
As the hospital grew and expanded, several new buildings were constructed on the grounds. In 1908 the beginning of the establishment of patient cottages began. This marked the beginning of the cottage system at Patton. Each cottage would house forty to seventy-five patients, separated by sex.  In 1928, all the wards and cottages would be renamed with letters for men and numbers for women.  In addition, most of Patton’s staff lived on the grounds until relatively recently in Patton’s history. Administrators, nursing staff, doctors, other clinical and medical staff, and laborers of all kinds lived in cottages, houses, and duplexes on Patton grounds. Families of staff also lived, worked, and grew up on the grounds. New housing for both patients and staff was almost always under construction. Kitchen and laundry staff and the patients that worked with them had to provide meals and laundry service to the entire staff as well as the patients.
Earthquakes in 1906, 1916, 1923, and 1933 caused major damage to the original buildings. This eventually led to the destruction of the Kirkbride building and the establishment of more modern buildings in the 1950s.  The need for another state hospital in the southern half of the state resulted in the opening of Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk which accepted its first patients in 1916.
By 1910, hydrotherapy began to be employed to treat patients at all the state hospitals in California. These therapies were widely utilized in the early to mid-twentieth century throughout the Western world. Hydrotherapy consisted of continuous baths, wet sheet wraps, and sprays.  In the 1916 report of the California State Commission in Lunacy it was reported that hydrotherapy had also become the preferred treatment for inebriates in state institutions.  In 1928 Patton’s administrators announced that all forms of mechanical restraint at the hospital had been abolished and that “Hydrotherapy, through the providing of adequate equipment, bas been substituted [for mechanical restraint] with marked results.”
By 1916, Patton had abandoned homeopathic medicine for biomedical causation and treatment of mental illness. George H. Kirby, a clinical psychiatrist at Manhattan State Hospital and a representative of the National Society for Mental Hygiene made a survey of methods of care in the California state hospitals that year and reported, “The medical work at our hospitals is unquestionably advancing along more scientific lines.”  His comment reflects the move towards more biomedical approaches, often utilizing experimental therapies.
In 1921 the Department of Institutions replaced the Commission in Lunacy. This department oversaw the state hospitals as well as homes for the feebleminded.  By the early 1920s there were nearly 12,000 patients in California state hospitals, 2,188 of whom were at Patton.  In 1927, Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity was added to the California penal code and the state hospitals began receiving patients committed under this new law.
Patton’s staff and administrators have long been dedicated to remaining on the cutting edge of available treatments so new therapies were introduced regularly and usually embraced enthusiastically. Malaria fever therapy was one of those therapies. This treatment was introduced to Patton in 1928 for treatment of general paresis caused by syphilis. It consisted of injecting malaria-infected blood into a patient with syphilis in order to cause a fever that, in some cases, would cure the patient. Malaria fever therapy was used in the state hospitals until the late 1940s when penicillin became widely available for the treatment of syphilis.  There were many other therapies the hospital would embrace in the hopes of providing effective treatment to patients. Patton utilized insulin shock therapy and then electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the early 1940s. Insulin shock therapy was utilized at Patton from 1941 to 1947. Also in 1941, Patton physicians and scientists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, began experimenting with electroconvulsive therapy machines, three years after the procedure was developed in Italy. Widespread use of this technology in California did not begin until the mid-1940s.
Another controversial treatment that occurred at Patton was lobotomy, which was introduced at Patton in 1947. Three types of lobotomy were performed at Patton: the Mackenzie procedure, the prefrontal lobotomy, and the transorbital lobotomy. Lobotomies were generally reserved for violent and intractable patients. The transorbital lobotomy was developed by Walter Freeman who traveled around the country teaching this method at many mental hospitals. He visited Patton in 1951 and demonstrated the use of his technique while he was there. A total of 171 lobotomies were performed at Patton, 29 of which were performed by Walter Freeman. Lobotomies were discontinued at Patton in 1956, shortly after Chlorpromazine became available for use in state hospitals. Chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic medications had similar effects to those caused by a lobotomy. For this reason, Chlorpromazine was sometimes referred to as a “chemical lobotomy.”  The development of Chlorpromazine for use in treating the mentally ill marked the beginning of the availability and use of effective psychiatric medications. The introduction of Chlorpromazine ushered in the era of psychopharmacology and Patton embraced this treatment from the mid-1950s on.
Throughout most of its history, as discussed above, Patton also provided occupational, industrial, and recreational therapies and hydrotherapy.  
The Great Depression had a significant impact on the state hospitals. Overcrowding increased dramatically and, by 1936, Patton’s patient population reached 154 percent of its capacity; the most overcrowded the hospital would ever be.  A year later the Department of Institutions opened Camarillo State Hospital and hundreds of patients were transferred to Camarillo from Patton. By 1938 Patton’s overcrowded conditions had dropped but Patton was still at 120 percent of capacity.  The overcrowding continued during World War II and for a few years after the war because shortages of building materials greatly restricted the development of new facilities needed to keep pace with rising admissions. The severe overcrowding led to deplorable conditions for patients and treatment was difficult to provide. Dayrooms were converted to sleeping quarters, patients were sleeping on mattresses on the floors, basements and even dining quarters were filled to capacity with beds for the patients. At one point, over 300 patients were forced to sleep outdoors. Fire hazards were a significant concern and conditions were unsafe for the patients.  Patton had its own fire department for most of its history that responded to emergencies and oversaw safety hazards but there was little that could be done to make conditions safer until more facilities for patients could be provided.
In an effort to further ease overcrowding in the state hospitals, the state of California began to look for alternatives to commitment in the state institutions. Some of these alternatives included family care homes, urban psychopathic wards, community mental health programs, and outpatient clinics.  In order to streamline the system, the Department of Institutions split into three groups in 1945: the Youth Authority, the Department of Corrections, and the Department of Mental Hygiene. The state hospitals and other mental institutions fell under the purview of the Department of Mental Hygiene.  A year later the National Mental Health Act was passed. This act provided for research into mental illness, training of psychiatric personnel, and establishment of community mental hygiene clinics.
In the mid-1940s, California governor Earl Warren toured the state hospitals and was appalled by the conditions in which patients were forced to live. At the same time, Al Ostrow of the San Francisco News also toured the state hospitals and reported the deplorable conditions in a series of articles titled “People in the Dark.” Ostrow’s report along with Warren’s determination to see these conditions improve led to significant appropriations for improvement and expansion of the state hospitals through a post-war building program.  The aims of this program were to replace outmoded facilities, reduce overcrowding, and provide up-to-date care and treatment facilities.  This would lead to the addition of several new buildings at Patton in the early to mid-1950s and to the opening of three new state hospitals in California: DeWitt, Modesto, and Atascadero. By the end of the 1950s Patton had added a new administration building (this replaced the last remaining portion of the original Kirkbride building which was demolished in 1955), an auditorium, a state-of-the-art receiving and treatment building, a large unit for the tubercular patients, three new patient units, a new kitchen and a cafeteria.
The increase in facilities resulted in a further increase of the patient population at Patton, which peaked at over 5,500 patients in the mid-1950s. In 1958 the population of patients in the ten California state hospitals peaked at 37,489.  Contributing to the increase in patient population was the passage of the Health Officer’s Admission Law in 1948. This law was passed so that the mentally ill would not have to undergo the trauma of being committed by the court but the drawback of this law was that it made it even easier to commit patients to mental institutions.
Patton’s atmosphere changed for the better in 1946 when Dr. Otto L. Gericke became superintendent of Patton. Gericke’s impact on the hospital was significant. He approved the publication of the Patton Progress, a weekly patient-written newspaper that quickly became popular even beyond the grounds of the hospital. He began placing suggestion boxes in all the patient wards in an effort to improve life for the patients. The hospital began to hold numerous events and holidays and added more recreational programs. Patton held open house events that invited the community onto the grounds and for many years took part in the annual Orange Show, providing exhibits and displays about Patton and mental health in an effort to improve relations with local community and to increase awareness and battle the stigma associated with mental illness. Gericke’s superintendency lasted over 26 years. He retired in 1972.
During Gericke’s time at Patton, significant changes took place in the state hospital system. Beginning in the 1950s with the introduction of chlorpromazine, the availability of effective psychopharmaceuticals allowed some previously intractable patients to be able to function outside the hospital.  In addition, three acts of the California legislature played a significant role in what would become known as the deinstitutionalization movement. The first piece of legislation was the Short-Doyle Act, passed in California in 1957. This act created a funding structure for an enlarged community mental health system. It expanded outpatient resources for mental health care and contributed to the rapid decrease in state hospital patient population.  The Short-Doyle Act was followed by the federal Community Mental Health Centers Act, passed in 1963, which led to the further development of the community mental health care system. This act increased grants to improve preventive and community care and was meant to improve treatment in state hospitals. The third piece of legislation that further drove deinstitutionalization was the Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) Act, passed in California in 1968. This act ordered the release of all harmless mentally ill patients. The act also established a new process for the involuntary commitment of mentally ill patients only if they were deemed a danger to themselves or others, or if they were gravely disabled. This new commitment process was established in an attempt to balance civil rights and public safety. The LPS Act also linked treatment to the community mental health system and removed financial obstacles to using community services.
Other events contributed to the rapid patient depopulation at Patton. In 1963 eighteen buildings, mostly cottages, at Patton were ruled unsafe by the fire marshal causing Patton to find ways to expedite the release of the harmless mentally ill.  Patton’s administrators utilized systems to assist soon-to-be-released patients with their transition out of the hospital and into the wider population. In 1965 Patton established a Community House  as well as a Leave Planning Center to assist patients with the transition.  In addition, Medicare and Medicaid laws, passed in 1965, allowed for elderly patients to be transferred to nursing homes for care.
By 1966 Patton’s patient population had dropped by thirty-five percent.  Further depopulation occurred when Ronald Reagan was elected as governor of California in 1966. In the face of civil libertarians, the patients’ rights movement, and California’s economic issues, Reagan began to dismantle the state hospital system.  He ordered a decrease of 550 psychiatric technicians from state hospitals, 237 of whom worked at Patton.  Psychiatric technicians played a highly significant role in the care, treatment, and monitoring of patients and this decrease had far reaching implications on the ability of the state hospitals to provide proper care.
There were also inevitable issues with releasing patients so quickly. The community care system was not prepared for the influx of former state hospital patients. Following the deaths of seven former Patton patients in a fourteen month period, death certificates were mailed to all members of the legislature with a letter arguing that patients were being prematurely released from the hospital. In addition, the county coroner requested that 160 patients be returned to Patton when it was discovered that they were being treated in unlicensed community facilities without medications and proper supervision. It was discovered that the County Mental Health Unit received incentives for each patient day that was not used. The board of supervisors authorized the transfer and asked the state to stop transferring patients out of Patton until the community was adequately prepared to receive patients.
In 1973, Reagan announced a plan to phase out all the state hospitals, causing the closure of Modesto, Dewitt, and Mendocino State Hospitals, and the conversion of Agnews and Stockton State Hospitals from institutions for the mentally ill to institutions for the care of the developmentally disabled, but the goal of completely abandoning the state hospital system was never reached. Plans to phase out the remaining state hospitals were halted by the state legislature after several murders committed by mental patients occurred in the early to mid-1970s.
As California’s state hospitals emptied and several of them closed, the farming and ranch operations were phased out by 1968. Patients also no longer worked in the industrial shops and many of those shops were closed. As the mentally ill population at Patton began to decrease, Gericke agreed to admit people with developmental disabilities beginning in 1962 in an effort to keep the hospital open.  Patton also began to admit Mentally Disordered Sex Offenders (MDSO’s) and received its first maximum-security patients in 1968. These changes kept Patton from closing.
Gericke’s retirement in 1972 marked the end of an era. Patton had changed from a general mental health facility to a forensic facility and a provider for the care of the developmentally disabled. Patton closed off considerably from the wider community and began to change into a maximum security facility.  The Patton Progress was phased out along with several other recreational therapy programs. Gericke’s policy of maintaining a staff photographer was also abandoned due to patient privacy concerns.
Many changes to the system occurred in the late 20th century. The Department of Mental Health replaced the Department of Mental Hygiene in 1973.  Admission rates at Patton decreased by sixty percent between 1971 and 1975, and by 1976 Patton’s mentally ill patient population dropped to 823.  In the early 1980s the developmentally disabled patients were phased out and by 1983 Patton was a forensic-only facility. All patients from then on would be committed by court order, mostly as Incompetent to Stand Trial (IST) or Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGI). In that same year the California Department of Corrections became responsible for patrol of the perimeter of the grounds, uniforms were issued for patients and officers, and plans developed to fence the perimeter. This led to the placement of security fences around the hospital grounds and patient wards by 1985.  In 1990 Patton consisted of twenty-six units in five buildings and was licensed for a maximum of 1,348 beds. The census in 1990 revealed that the patient population consisted of 1,024 patients of which 893 were male and 131 were female. The total number of employees at that time was 1,564. 
Today Patton is overseen by the Department of State Hospitals which was established in 2012 to streamline the state hospital system. There are currently five stand-alone hospitals and three facilities located in prisons in the state hospital system. Patton is currently the largest state hospital in the country. Patton’s history is typical of the California state hospitals and provides a narrative through which one can understand the history and development of mental health care in California from the late 19th century to the present. Patton opened the first museum in the California state hospital system on April 17, 2015. A second state hospital museum was established on February 16, 2016 at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, CA as part of their centennial celebration.

There are approximately 2,022 former patients buried in a field with a dirt road that runs up to it. These were patients whose bodies were left unclaimed or whose families were unknown. Today it is well marked as cemetery ground and there is a mass grave marker dedicated to the patients which can be seen approximately 50 yards from the street. The grounds are located inside the property fence in the north-west corner. 
The cemetery was full by 1930. After that when people died and were unclaimed, their bodies were donated for research to what is now Loma Linda University.

California,Stockton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Stockton_State_Hospital,1851.0,,1853,Closed,Pre-1854 Plans,,Insane Asylum of California at Stockton | Stockton Developmental Center,"Constructed as the Insane Asylum of California at Stockton in 1853, the complex was situated on 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land donated by Captain Weber. The legislature at the time felt that existing hospitals were incapable of caring for the large numbers of people who suffered from mental and emotional conditions as a result of the Gold Rush, and authorized the creation of the first public mental health hospital in California. The hospital is one of the oldest in the west, and was notable for its progressive forms of treatment. The hospital is #1016 on the Office of Historic Preservation's California Historical Landmark list, and today is home to California State University Stanislaus.
In 1865 the first section of new facilities for the female patients was completed. The entire structure was not completed, however, until 1874. Total cost was $249,500. It was constructed on the east side of North American Street, between East Vine and East Magnolia streets. The Smith Canal, which currently ends well short of the state hospital, extended from the Stockton Delta Channel all the way to the state hospital and was used to Ferry supplies in the early days. That part of the canal has now been filled in and it terminates in a small Lake in Legion Park.
This three and four-story structure had a capacity of 325 patients. As overcrowding became a problem. chairs and beds were placed in the narrow hallways. Patients were often strapped into these chairs and they sat in semi-darkness. The entire building contained only two chimneys. On each floor marble fireplaces served the visiting rooms, the employee sickroom, and the wards located in both wings of the building.
The central section of the structure was topped by a tower rising over 200 feet from ground level. This tower was used as a navigation checkpoint by river pilots on vessels in Stockton Channel. Beneath this tower were the first floor main entrance, doctors' quarters on the second floor, matrons' quarters on the third floor, and a large dayroom on the fourth floor. Notable features at the entrance area included frosted handcut glass in the door, and on each side the antique, Victorian furniture of the sitting room. A cherrywood spiral stairway ascended to the floors above. The north and south wings were three stories in height and housed the institution's female patients.
Contrary to what one might expect, these early patients did not remain in the Asylum for too long a time. Of more than 2,000 patients admitted to Stockton from 1852 to 1862, nearly 40 percent were discharged within six months. This can be partially attributed to the large number of patients hospitalized for abnormal behavior associated with alcoholism (which accounted for over 10 percent of all first admissions), but it was probably due to a greater extent to the philosophy of treatment practiced by the early superintendents. Prior to the Civil War, the physicians in charge of the institution followed the precepts of ""moral treatment,"" a system denoted by humane, individualized treatment and the return to society as soon as possible. This is quite similar to the philosophy of treatment followed in psychiatric hospitals today.
The south wing of the Female Building, begun in 1865, was completed in 1867, while the center and north wings were not opened until 1868 and 1874, respectively. The entire structure, when finished, comfortably accommodated 325 patients. In the meantime, conditions in the male wards again reached an overcrowded state. A row of wooden buildings called the ""Cottage Ward"" had been constructed in 1869 and thereafter occupied by 160 patients until the first section of the Men's Building, commonly referred to as ""The Bricks,"" was opened in 1884 with a capacity of 387 patients.
The men's brick building on Grant Street between Acacia and Flora streets was the second men's building on the hospital grounds. Originally ""maniacs"" were locked in dungeons in the basement. At mealtime, patients were issued only spoons to eat with for fear they would stab someone with a knife or fork. Up until 1950 there was no heat in the dining room and patients used to shiver while they ate. The first advance in patient recreation at the hospital came when a clubroom was set up in this building about 1954. The building originally had three steeples. On November 30, 1938, a patient set fire to some oily rags in a closet. The resultant fire wiped out all of Ward 6, plus the steeple above it and allowed many patients to escape. The other steeples were removed later because of weakness and leakage.
The structure was deactivated bit by bit, starting in February, 1958 and ending in August of that year. Most of the administrative offices had been located here but had moved into the new administration building in 1953. Several offices remained, however, until the Professional Building was completed in 1962. Demolition was completed in 1964, and it is estimated that 3,250,000 bricks were removed.
In 1973, the State of California made an attempt to more effectively administer the complex and interrelated programs of physical and mental health and consolidate these programs under one department called the Department of Health. This consolidation, unfortunately, proved to be adverse, especially to patients with mental health needs. In 1978, the Department of Health was reevaluated, then segmented into several smaller and specifically directed departments, including the Department of Mental Health, Department of Developmental Services, Department of Social Services, Department of Health Services, Department of Alcohol and Drug Abuse, and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. At this time, the Stockton State Hospital was placed under the Department of Developmental Services. In 1986, Stockton State Hospital was renamed the Stockton Developmental Center and remained open for ten more years, until the fiscal year of 1995-1996, when it officially closed its doors due to downsizing of the State's Developmental Centers under the Coffelt Settlement Agreement.

California,Edgemoor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Edgemoor_Farm,,,1923,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Edgemoor Farm and Home for the Aged and Indigent | Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital | Edgemoor Hospital,"Edgemoor was originally a ""poor farm"" – a meat and dairy farm where the indigent lived in exchange for their labor. The county purchased the property in 1923, and farm buildings were used to care for poor, elderly people & mentally ill. By the mid-1920s the Edgemoor cared for 520 people. Throughout the years the County added new buildings; in 1950 apartments and wards were added. In 1945, Edgemoor Farm became the Home of the Aged and Indigent of San Diego County and in 1947, two dairy barns were converted to house partially or completely bedridden patients.
By 1955, farming activities were phased out, a patient care building was constructed and the Edgemoor Farm facility was a licensed Public Medical Institution and the name was changed to Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital. Trying to escape the stigma of ""poor farm,"" buildings were given Spanish names: Santa Maria, Barona, Carillo, Pico, Ortega, Yarba, Serra and Couts after the original old San Diego families and Spanish Land Grants. During 1951, Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital began providing skilled nursing and rehabilitative care, primarily to elderly indigent persons. Also in 1951, Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital received 169 patients from Camp Elliot.
Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital housed the first fire engine in Santee, which was manned by volunteers of Edgemoor employees. Since all water was obtained from wells, one of the first things built was a water tank that was used weekly and refilled with fresh water. The water district later piped water into Edgemoor Farm to be used only for fire fighting. In 1960 that Edgemoor became the first facility in California to be licensed as a ""Specialty Geriatric Hospital."" In 1962 a new rehabilitation center was built and the facility name changed to Edgemoor Hospital. In 2007 a new hospital opened on a new site as part of the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital.

California,Hollydale Mental Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hollydale_Mental_Hospital,,1887.0,1888,Closed,Cottage Plan,,"County Poor Farm | Rancho Los Amigos Hospital, Southern Campus | Downey Insane Asylum | Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center","The Poor Farm got its start in 1887 when the county purchased 124.4 acres and hired the team of architects who had designed the Pico House in the Olvera Street area, St. Vibiana Cathedral and USC's Widney Hall. They came up with a U-shaped design with a central courtyard separating female living areas on the north, male quarters on the south and a dining building at one end. The farm's first residents arrived by horse-drawn wagon in December 1888. During the 1890s, the population grew from 125 to about 200 indigents, most over age 60. The farm quickly expanded to 227 acres.
In its day, the county Poor Farm was an anomaly. A 1902 story in The Times described the place as ""wrapped in sunbeams and wreathed with flower gardens."" ""The Los Angeles County Poor Farm visibly resents the incongruity of it name,"" the story said. The story described male residents' living quarters as ""immense,"" with as many as 30 beds along the walls. Three men's wards opened to a central courtyard, and each resident was provided with bedding, a chair and a small bed stand. There was a large reading room filled with several hundred books ""for those who can read,"" the story reported. Another building housed female residents.
By 1910, the Poor Farm covered nearly 400 acres. A Times report that year described the farm's four main brick buildings as being shaded by evergreens and palms. ""At first glance the place might be thought a comfortable, old-fashioned country mansion."" The paper noted that the farm's newest building -- ""the insane ward"" -- was a one-story structure that housed 25 ""harmless"" patients.
The Poor Farm was renamed ""Sunny Acres"" in 1931 by officials seeking a ""less odious name,"" as one county supervisor put it. The farming operation was phased out in the '30s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt's social welfare programs kicked in. During World War II, the U.S. Army turned part of the hospital grounds into Camp Morrow, and at the same time the facility operated as an emergency hospital. It was reorganized once again as a long-term care facility after the war, mostly for victims of polio. Entire wards were filled with iron lungs in the 1950s, humming and clicking away, breathing for the victims inside as they recuperated. The facility operated as the Rancho Los Amigos hospital for chronic illnesses until the 1950s, when a polio epidemic turned it into a rehabilitation center.
In the 1980's the building was shut down and replaced by the newly remodeled Rancho Los Amigos Hospital.",,"Downey, CA",,,,,,,,1

The city constructed a four story wood frame building on the old San Miguel Rancho west of Twin Peaks. The large rancho site had a natural spring that fed a deep lagoon, hence the name Laguna Honda, and the almshouse grew its own food and livestock on the 87 acres. A 24-bed hospital was opened during a smallpox epidemic in 1868, and was replaced by a small asylum two years later. Buildings continued to be added to the site.
The defining event of the early part of the new century was the great earthquake and fire of 1906.  The Almshouse was pressed into service to house and care for thousands of displaced San Franciscans.  Now known as the Relief Home, it consolidated earthquake victims living in refugee camps scattered across the city.  A new pavilion-style building was constructed, able to accommodate 1,000 people.  The building was dedicated in 1909 by President Theodore Roosevelt. By 1910, the city had added another stately new building to the Relief Home.  Known as Clarendon Hall, it housed 250 people, and for the first time was intended specifically for people who needed long term medical care.
The leap from Relief Home to skilled nursing facility began in earnest in the 1920’s when Mayor James “Sunny Jim” Rolph turned over the first spade of earth for the Spanish Revival-style buildings that would become Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Those buildings, whose Mediterranean tile work is echoed in the architecture of today’s Laguna Honda, were opened in 1926 and continued to grow in the decades that followed with the addition of new “finger wings,” the long, Florence Nightingale-style open wards that were customary at the time.[1]
In the 1930s, Laguna Honda became a teaching center for the University of California medical school. Surgery began to be performed, and cardiograph and x-ray technology was introduced.  The entryway to the main building was graced with now-classic WPA murals, which are still on display.
By 2008 Clarendon Hall was demolished for the new Laguna Honda Hospital buildings designed by Anshen+Allen Architects and Stantec Architecture, though they are not really visible from the road with all the tree coverage.",,"San Francisco, CA",Spanish Revival,,,,,,,1

Sonoma Developmental Center (SDC) is the oldest facility in California established specifically for serving the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. The facility opened its doors to 148 residents on November 24, 1891, culminating a ten-year project on the part of two prominent Northern California women who had children with developmental disabilities.
In 1883, Julia Judah and Frances Bentley were responsible for forming the California Association for the Care and Training of Feeble Minded Children. Its aim was ""to provide and maintain a school and asylum for the feeble-minded, in which they may be trained to usefulness.""
The first facility was opened in May 1884, at White Sulphur Springs near Vallejo. Beset by problems, the association petitioned the California legislature for assistance, and a bill was passed calling for the creation of the California Home for the Care and Training of the Feeble Minded. The new board chose a 51-acre site in the town of Santa Clara to handle twenty residents.
When the Santa Clara home became inadequate a few years later, the legislature appointed a commission and appropriated $170,000 to purchase land, construct facilities and handle commission expenses. The commission included Captain Oliver Eldridge, after whom the community of Eldridge is named. Following lengthy legislative battles over the proposed funding, the commission selected the present site: a 1640-acre parcel which featured an ample water supply, drainage, and two railroad lines that passed through the property.
The facility at Eldridge has undergone many significant changes, including four name changes. In 1909, the name was changed from the California Home for the Care and Training of the Feeble Minded to the Sonoma State Home. In 1953, Sonoma State Home became Sonoma State Hospital; and in 1986, the name was changed to Sonoma Developmental Center. Over the years, the facility has expanded several times, including two major expansions: A thirteen million dollar expansion program was initiated in 1948, and another five million dollars was appropriated in 1956. The most recent renovation took place between 1979 and 1982, during which all the living units were renovated at a cost of about one million dollars per building, primarily to improve safety, privacy and individualized care.
Many changes over the last 110 years include attitudes, philosophies, values, and beliefs in regard to the treatment of developmentally disabled people. There is one constant that ties the present and the future to every epoch of the Center's history: As society's understanding of developmental disabilities has improved, SDC has consistently responded by improving services. Sonoma Developmental Center has always been and will always be committed to continuous improvement of its comprehensive array of therapeutic services.[1]
The Developmental Center was ordered by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2015 to begin a three-year closure process, with an official shuttering date of Dec. 31, 2018. SDC had at its peak been home to more than 3,000 residents; its final clients left the Eldridge campus in mid-December, according to officials at the state Department of Developmental Services. 
First District Supervisor Susan Gorin has said that her constituents want to see the land dedicated to public open space. She has articulated a plan that would see the state grant the property to the county, and then see it transferred to the adjacent state and regional parks systems.

California,Preston School of Industry,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Preston_School_of_Industry,1890.0,,1894,Closed & Preserved,Single Building,,Preston Youth Correctional Facility,"In 1890, the 230 acre parcel of land where the Preston Castle stands was purchased from the Ione Coal & Iron Company for $30 per acre with 100 acres donated. The land was purchased to house the Preston School of Industry, established by the State Legislature as a progressive action toward rehabilitating, rather than simply imprisoning, juvenile offenders.
Building of the Preston School of Industry started right away. The bricks for the building were made at San Quentin and Folsom prisons using sandstone that was quarried six miles from Ione. They were then delivered by rail at 6,000 bricks per car. The cornerstone was laid on December 23, 1890 with 2,500 people in attendance. The plans for the school were ambitious with the original plans showing 77 rooms on five floors. The building would be the most significant example of Romanesque Revival architecture in the Mother Lode.
The Preston School of Industry remained open until 1960 when new facilities for the school were completed. The building remained vacant and fading into disrepair until September 10, 2001 when The Preston Castle Foundation received a fifty-year lease for the property. The Preston Castle has also been named a California State Historical Landmark (#867) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

California,San Francisco Industrial School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=San_Francisco_Industrial_School,1854.0,1855.0,1859,Demolished,Single Building,,,"In 1854, San Francisco purchased 100 acres for $10,000 from John Horner at the intersection of the San Jose Road and the Ocean House Road (the precursors of today's San Jose Avenue and Ocean Avenue) for the construction of the House of Refuge—an institution to deal with neglected, abandoned, and delinquent children under the age of 16. The footprint of that 100 acres still exists on today's maps as Balboa Park and City College of San Francisco.
In May of 1859 the ""San Francisco Industrial School"" opened in an unfinished building on the House of Refuge lot. In 1865, the building was completed with the addition of the North Wing. That same year a 60-foot right-of-way was sold to the San Jose Railroad. This would later become the right-of-way for the Southern Pacific Railroad and finally Interstate Highway 280. In the 1870s, the city built the House of Correction—ostensibly a correctional/rehabilitation facility for the slightly older criminals than those housed in the Industrial School, but not so hardened that they should be sent to San Quentin. For decades these two buildings stood almost side-by-side, separated by a wooden fence. Armed guards watched over the population of the House of Correction while unarmed ""officers"" supervised the Industrial School's population.
Originally both boys and girls were committed to the Industrial School, but the mischief resulting from the co-mingling of the sexes resulted in the girls being ""farmed out"" to the Sisters of Mercy at the Magdalen Asylum originally located on the side of today's General Hospital.
Crises, controversies, and scandals plagued the Industrial School. It was almost closed after only two years when the State of California opened a reform school in Marysville, but that institution was a failure from the start and shut its doors to send its remaining boys to San Francisco in 1868. Finally, with the opening of the State Reform schools in Whittier and Ione in 1890 and 1891, the Industrial School sent its last inmates away.
On the closing of the Industrial School, its building was taken over by the San Francisco sheriff to became a women's jail. After being badly damaged in the 1906 earthquake, half of the original building was razed.",1893,"San Francisco, CA",,,1859,1891,,,,0

California had only been a state for a little more than a decade. The official California capital city had yet to be determined and wouldn’t be named until 1879. Multiple cities vied for the designation, hoping to land state facilities to better their chances. It was in this setting that California established the State Reform School in Marysville in 1860. The school was constructed in 1861 and opened near the end of the year. The new school housed eight boys in April 1862 and 13 later in the year. Meanwhile, San Francisco’s reform school housed many more children at a significantly reduced per-inmate cost.
The Assembly passed an act (Assembly Bill 505) providing for the removal of the inmates of the State Reform School (in Marysville) to the Industrial School, San Francisco in 1866. An 1867 report to Gov. Frederick F. Low showed the school was still running in Marysville. By 1868, the Marysville reform school was a “deserted village,” according to newspapers.

California,Whittier State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Whittier_State_School,1889.0,,1891,Closed,Cottage Plan,W.K Daniels,Fred C. Nelles School for Boys |  Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility,"The March 11, 1889 Act of the California Legislature authorized the establishment of a school for juvenile offenders. Dedication and laying of cornerstone was done by Governor R. W. Waterman on February 12, 1890. Officially opened as 'Whittier State School' for boys and girls on July 1, 1891. Renamed 'Fred C. Nelles School for Boys' in 1941 ('For Boys' was dropped around 1970).
The school was originally organized around the Administration Building, an imposing and substantial structure of brick and red sandstone known as The Castle, which held the living quarters, classrooms and administrative offices. In the early years, confinement, discipline, education and employment were the primary methods used for reforming the institution’s boy and girl population. The children were educated in classrooms in The Castle, worked in the various maintenance and trade shops, and labored in the surrounding agricultural fields. After a damaging fire in 1913 led to the discovery of its faulty construction, The Castle was torn down in 1916. Some stone blocks were salvaged from the building and are still preserved on site.
From 1912 to 1927, under the leadership of Superintendent Fred C. Nelles, innovative programs were initiated for the treatment and reform of juveniles. Nelles relocated the girls out of the facility in 1916 to the newly founded Ventura School for Girls, fulfilling his goal for a separate institution for girls. The female wards, who were housed in the Girl's Department, were moved to Ventura to the California School for Girls in 1916 (the separation and move was established by an act of the legislature in 1913). It was later renamed to the Ventura School for Girls (likely to remove any taint to the institution). The girls were not transferred until 1916 because the institution was not ready to accept new wards. Nelles introduced the first psychiatrists and psychologists, instituted clinical programs and began to focus the school’s programs upon the individual needs of each child. The campus was rebuilt with a new park-like campus plan that featured smaller Period Revival-style buildings. The new school embodied Nelles’ Cottage System, which placed the children into smaller groups based on age, maturity, and delinquency. This system created an atmosphere similar to a home environment, which was thought to benefit the children and help socialize them. The State of California, Division of Architecture, Department of Public Works was responsible for the design and construction of these campus improvements.
After 1941, the facility was largely redeveloped with Mid-Century Modern buildings that reflected the CYA’s more modern approach of reform. The appearance of the campus continued to change into the 1980s when a large penitentiary-style correctional building was constructed. In 2004, the CYA (California Youth Authority) closed the Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility in Whittier. This was its oldest facility spanning more than 100 years. The last ward left the facility on May 27, 2004.",2004,"Whittier, CA",,,1891,2004,,,,0

The counties also purchased an adjacent parcel to increase the size to 480 acres. The sanatorium built dozens of structures over the years, including a hospital complex, quarters for doctors and nurses, a children's home, and a school. Julia Morgan, noted architect of Hearst Castle, designed some of the buildings. The original tavern building served as a kitchen and dining area until it burned down in 1937. The sanatorium started with 16 patients and eventually grew to care for more than 100. Besides taking care of patients, sanatorium staff kept farm animals and grew fruit and vegetables on the property. The patient load declined as new techniques and medicines were found to treat tuberculosis, and the sanatorium closed in 1969.
In 1969, a private non-profit corporation established a school on the site, using many of the existing buildings, for boys with behavioral problems. The students learned to care for the school's animals and perform other vocational tasks. The population of boys eventually reached 59, with about that many staff. The school closed in 1985. The property ended up in the hands of Madera County and a caretaker lived on the property until the early 1990’s, at which time local residents began to push for establishing a park on the site.",1985,,,,1969,1985,,,59,0

California,Dr. Hare’s Private Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Dr._Hare%E2%80%99s_Private_Sanitarium,,,1891,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Health care in Fresno was greatly enhanced in 1891 with the arrival of an innovative husband-and-wife doctor team, George A. and Jessie D. Hare. They met as medical students at the University of Michigan. Jessie Hare was one of the nation’s first female physicians. After working at the famed Battle Creek, Mich., sanitarium, they moved to Fresno for warm weather. They opened a sanitarium — an early day hospital — stressing therapy along with rehabilitation and treatment.
At first the sanitarium was at the corner of N and Mariposa streets. In 1892, they moved to a large Victorian house on the northwest corner of K (Van Ness) and Stanislaus streets. They called it Dr. Hare’s Private Sanitarium. They started the first accredited nurses training program and what’s thought to be the first operating room in Fresno. In 1897, George Hare pioneered the use of X-rays in the Valley, using homemade equipment. One that he took in 1903, with a 30-minute exposure, remains at the Fresno-Madera Medical Society, showing a bullet lodged in a patient’s shoulder. The Hares stressed emotional well-being and healthful living. Patients often traveled great distances, even from other states, for their care.
In 1904 they closed the sanitarium after they were called to Washington, D.C., to set up another sanitarium (now Washington Adventist Hospital.) George Hare was a delegate to the International Medical Congress in Lisbon, Portugal. Devout Seventh-day Adventists, they turned down a dinner invitation from the king of Portugal because the dinner was on Saturday, their Sabbath. George Hare also passed on a chance to accompany Theodore Roosevelt on one of his presidential campaigns because of the need to discuss financial terms on Saturdays.
The Hares returned to Fresno in 1906 and resumed their practice. In 1914, they built a Craftsman bungalow home and an office building at 815 E. McKinley, where they lived and worked. George Hare became president of the American Academy of Medicine in 1915. After years of high radiation doses from early X-ray technology, he died at age 76 of bone cancer. Jessie Hare continued practicing a few years, and died at age 93.
The site of the old Dr. Hare’s Private Sanitarium is now in the parking lot of the closed Fresno Metropolitan Museum.",1904,"Fresno, CA",,,1892,1904,,,,0

California,Gardner Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Gardner_Sanitarium,1900.0,,1901,Preserved,Single Building,,,"On 18 Aug 1900, Dr. Alden Monroe Gardner, medical superintendent for the State Asylum for the Insane at Napa, purchased the Ralston estate in Belmont for $35,000 from the Union Trust Company of San Francisco. This was to be the home of the Gardner Sanitarium, the state’s 1st private mental sanitarium. As advertised in the California State Journal of Medicine in 1904, the sanitarium specialized in nervous disorders, including substance abuse and also served those recovering from serious illness. The Report of the Commission of Lunacy v.6 (Sacramento: 1908 California Commission of Lunacy p106) - Gardner Sanitarium- Belmont stated that the minimum rate for care at the sanitarium wass $125 a month.  There were at that time 33 patients with a maximum bed count of 60.  Nurses did not wear uniforms, so patients would not stand out.  The 79 acre estate allowed patients to roam without interacting with the public.
Although Dr. Gardner died as a patient in his own sanitarium in 1913, his son  P.S. (Sherman) Gardner continued to run it until 1922. In 1923 the Ralston property was sold to the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur.  They had been looking to relocate their college from San Jose.

Rice home, which now stands in the middle of a mobile home park along Highway 1, was bought by the Theosophical community and became the Halcyon Hotel and Sanitarium, attracting patients from throughout the United States. Dr. Dower specialized in treating alcoholism, drug addictions, nervous disorders and tuberculosis. Patients were encouraged to take long walks on the Oceano Dunes and along the beaches to commune with nature.
Because of Dr. Dower’s involvement in tuberculosis treatment, he purchased the first X-ray machine in Central California and employed what was then considered state-of-the-art treatment, including electrotherapy and hydrotherapy. The treatment facility for the tubercular patients was separated from the other wards. Patients were served healthy food and given light exercise, and they slept in outdoor pavilions with canvas roof covers that rolled back in good weather. Patients were treated without regard to financial status, placing a heavy burden on the Theosophical community. The community’s magazine, The Temple Artisan, sought sponsors for patients, stating that $10 a month would support treatment for a person in recovery.
The hospital’s activities ended with Dr. Dower’s death in 1937. By 1949 the Sanatorium was sold and the Temple property was consolidated into the present-day pattern of about 95 acres with the Temple owning 30 of the 52 homes.",1937,"Halcyon, CA",,,[None],[1949],[None],[None],[None],1

California,Rockhaven Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rockhaven_Sanitarium,,,1923,Preserved,Rambling Plan,,Screen Actors Sanitarium,"Rockhaven Sanitarium, which was also known as the Screen Actors Sanitarium, was originally founded in January 1923 by a nurse named Agnes Richards.  After witnessing firsthand the poor treatment of the mentally ill while working in both San Bernardino’s Patton State Hospital and the Los Angeles County General Hospital (which is ironically where Gladys Baker gave birth to Norma Jean on June 1st, 1926), Richards decided to open her own “secluded sanctuary” to treat ailing women with dignity in a home-like setting.  She leased a two-story building with a stone façade (hence the name “Rockhaven”) on Honolulu Avenue in Montrose for $125 a month and took in six patients, whom she called “residents.”  By the next year, the number of residents had grown to 24.
To house the growing number of residents, Richards began purchasing neighboring homes, as well as constructing new buildings on adjacent vacant land.  She also eventually bought the original stone dwelling.  By 1940, the expanded site, which was one of California’s first private mental health institutions, consisted of 15 Craftsman and Spanish Revival-style buildings, 12 lots of land totaling 3.3 acres, facilities to treat over one hundred patients, a small hospital, a dining hall, and a professional kitchen.  The gorgeous grounds, which won a landscaping award in 1966, featured gardens, towering oak trees, grottos, ponds, flowerbeds, fountains, shaded patios, statuaries, and meandering footpaths.
As Richards began to gradually withdraw from running Rockhaven in 1956, her granddaughter, Patricia Traviss, took over daily operations.  Patricia continued to run the facility until 2001, when she retired and sold it to the Ararat Home of Los Angeles.  Ararat transformed the property into a nursing home, but, claiming it was too difficult to maintain, wound up closing its doors in 2006. The city of Glendale purchased the site for $8.25 million in April 2008. And while there were originally plans to turn the historic location into a community center and public park, when the economy took a downturn, that project had to be put on hold.
In 2014 the City of Glendale began talking with contractors to allow them to build on the undeveloped property and make the existing buildings, built between 1920-1939, into some form of adaptive reuse. The community is working to protect the property and get it opened as an historic park.",2006,"Glendale, CA",,,1923,2006,,100,,0

California,St. Vincent Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Vincent_Sanitarium,,,1883,Demolished,Single Building,,St. Vincent's Infirmary,"The Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul established the first hospital in Los Angeles - the Los Angeles Infirmary, in 1856. It was located in the Sonora Town adobe owned by then-Mayor of Los Angeles, Don Cristobal Aguilar. Four years later, in 1860, the hospital relocated to 1416 Naud Street, between Ann (named for Sister Ann) and Sotillo Street (though other data indicates the location was 1414 Naud Street, between N. Main and San Fernando Road). In 1869, Daughters incorporated the Los Angeles Infirmary under their own ownership, the first women in the region to do so.
In 1883 they purchased six and a half acres of land at Beaudry Park at a cost of $10,000, and a new hospital building was erected a year later at Beaudry and Sunset, on a hillside overlooking Sonora Town. By 1898, Los Angeles Infirmary had come to be known as Sisters Hospital, but both names were used interchangeably in reference to the same hospital; in 1918, the name was officially changed to St. Vincent's Hospital. In 1924 a new building was erected on 3rd and Alvarado, which was built by John C. Austin and Frederick M. Ashley. For 47 years, the hospital had such a steady growth that they were forced to expand yet again, and groundbreaking for a newer, larger building took place in 1971 - this time, located at 2131 W. 3rd Street. With a ""new"" hospital came a new name, and in 1974, it changed again, this time becoming St. Vincent Medical Center.",,"Los Angeles, CA",,,,,,,,1

McBride established his new sanitarium the City of Pasadena was experiencing a boom in development that nearly tripled its population by the end of that decade. The land boom of the 1880s spurred on by the completion of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the promotion of the City as a haven for tourists and seekers of cures for tuberculosis and other diseases set the stage for Dr. McBride’s endeavor. After graduating from Bellevue Hospital College in 1873 and establishing the Milwaukee Sanitarium for Nervous Disorders in 1884, Dr. McBride moved from Wisconsin to Pasadena in 1886. Once in the City, he set up his medical practice at the home he purchased on Hermosa Vista (now in South Pasadena).
In 1904, two years after purchasing 29 acres of the Sunny Slope Ranch for $27,000, he and four other prominent doctors, Norman Bridge, Henry Brainerd, Wallace Barlow, and Merritt Campbell, formed the Southern California Sanitarium for Nervous Disorders. Dr.McBride’s parcel was bounded by Blanche, on the north, Monte Vista on the east, and Rose Avenue on the west. The sanitarium was incorporated on February 1, 1904, and subsequently, Dr.McBride hired the firm of Myron Hunt and Elmer Grey to design the first building of the facility. In 1917, the name of the hospital was changed to the Las Encinas Hospital for Nervous Disorders.
Before Marion Barlow died in 1964, after living out her years on the grounds of the old Huntington Hotel in Pasadena, the sanitarium began to fade. Medical science gained the upper hand in the fight against TB, rendering the Barlow approach of sunshine and rest passe. As the cottages drifted into a quaint backdrop, the sanitarium became Barlow Respiratory Hospital and added buildings, including a small acute-care facility. It also expanded its focus to lung disorders of various kinds. For a time, part of the facility was used as an AIDS hospice.[1]",,"Pasadena, CA",,,1904,,,,,0

California,Hillcrest Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hillcrest_Sanitarium,,,,Closed,Single Building,,,"The sanitarium in La Crescenta, California, that housed Japanese American tuberculosis patients during World War II. Hillcrest was one of a number of facilities run by the War Relocation Authority (WRA) for patients who were either too ill to be removed to concentration camps or who needed to be segregated due to having readily communicable diseases. Of the 500 Japanese American tubercular patients in Los Angeles County before the war, the ones deemed too ill to be moved to concentration camps were moved to two facilities: Hillcrest Sanitarium and Maryknoll Rest Home in Monrovia. Hillcrest held between 100 and 200 patients. An armed sentry guarded the inmates despite their illnesses. In mid 1943, Los Angeles County called on the WRA to remove the Japanese American patients, since it claimed it needed the beds for ""our own citizens."" In the summer of 1944, Japanese American patients at Hillcrest published a sixteen page booklet titled ""The Time,"" which included stories of the patients and staff. Rev. Herbert Nicholson and his wife Madeline were frequent visitors to Hillcrest, where he described the patients as having ""become one large, generally happy family,"" while also reporting that he officiated at 35 funerals of Hillcrest patients/inmates during the war. Hillcrest continued as an exclusively Japanese American sanitarium even after the war.",,"La Crescenta, CA",,,,,,,200,0

California,Olive View Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Olive_View_Sanatorium,,,1920,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Olive View Sanatorium opened Oct. 27, 1920, as care facility for tuberculosis patients. In 1962 the San Fernando Valley's first successful open-heart surgery was performed there. That same year, on Aug. 28, a brush fire that started at the Circle J Ranch in Saugus was driven south by fierce Santa Ana winds, devastating Gene Autry's Melody Ranch movie town in Placerita Canyon before cresting the ridge and spreading to Sylmar, where it took out Olive View's infirmary-surgery building and two garages. Eight hundred patients were evacuated.
As medical science conquered tuberculosis and Olive View was no longer needed for that purpose, it aligned with the UCLA School of Medicine and became Olive View Medical Center, an 888-bed teaching hospital that opened in December 1970. Six weeks later, the 6.6-magnitude San Fernando-Sylmar Earthquake of Feb. 9, 1971 (which epicenter was in the Iron Canyon section of Sand Canyon in Santa Clarita) felled the hospital's four stairwell wings and its parking structure. The rest of the facility was damaged beyond repair; it was demolished in 1973.
Part of the county-funded healthcare system for medically indigent and low-income patients in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, the hospital's staff delivered care at a site in Van Nuys until May 8, 1987, when Olive View reopened as a 377-bed hospital. It became Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in 1992 and is the principal intake facility for North County patients experiencing a psychiatric emergency.

California,Pottenger Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pottenger_Sanatorium,,,1903,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Dr. Frances Marion Pottenger was born and educated in Ohio, receiving his M.D. degree and graduating with the highest honors in his class. It was after Dr. Pottenger's wife died of tuberculosis in 1898, three years after she developed the disease, that he decided to take up the study of TB as his life's work. He opened the Pottenger Sanatorium in 1903 in what is now the 500-600 blocks of north Canyon Boulevard. When it first opened, it sat on 40 acres and had a capacity for eleven patients which later grew to accommodate 134 patients.
Perhaps the most famous of Pottenger’s patients was the silent screen star Mabel Normand. She was born on November 10, 1892, and starred in silent films from 1911-1926. She appeared in 12 films with Charlie Chaplin and another 17 with Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle. She was also a screenwriter, director, and producer. Her work in early films earned her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She suffered a recurrence of tuberculosis in 1923 which led to a decline in her health and finally retirement from films. She spent an extended time at the Pottenger Sanatorium and died there on February 23, 1930, at the age of 37.
Dr. Pottenger eventually became one of the leading lung specialists in Southern California, and one of the world's leaders and pioneers in the fight against tuberculosis. Because of his commitment to his work, the Pottenger Sanatorium became one of the most famous institutions devoted to the treatment of diseases of the lungs. He believed that isolating the
patient from the world outside and giving the patient fresh air with easy access to a physician provided the best chance for combating the disease.
The sanatorium was closed in 1955 when Dr. Pottenger, who was 88 years old at the time, retired. He died in 1967. For about the next 20 years, the land was leased to the Carmelite Order as a convent and retreat. Sometime in the 1970s the land was sold and became the housing development known as Canyon Crest. Today nothing remains of the sanatorium's buildings.",1955,"Monrovia, CA",,,1903,1955,134,,,0
