Oklahoma,Fort Supply State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fort_Supply_State_Hospital,1875,,1895,Active,Cottage Plan,,Fort Supply State Hospital | Western Hospital for Insane | Western State Psychiatric Center | Western Oklahoma Hospital | William S. Key Correctional Center (current) | Northwestern Center for Behavioral Health (current),"The first state hospital opened in Oklahoma was Western Oklahoma State Hospital, in Fort Supply. Opening in 1903, however it wasn't until May of 1908 that the first patients arrived from Norman's state hospital (Central State).The hospital used the old Army post's buildings and grounds as the state of Oklahoma's first mental health facility. The grounds were lent to the state by the Dept. of Interior, after the Headquarters of the Army closed Fort Supply. To bring the first patients from a private institution to the new hospital, a road was built from the old post to the railroad station south at Tangier, Oklahoma. Farmers and ranchers from the area furnished buggies and wagons to transport the two train loads of arriving patients to the new hospital.
The hospital and original buildings (left in disrepair by the Army, who had first voted to leave it abandoned) suffered 3 fires before 1916.
Western Oklahoma State Hospital cared for mentally ill people in or west of Kay, Noble, Garfield, Kingfisher, Canadian, Caddo, Comanche, and Cotton counties. In 1950, the hospital had an average daily resident population of 1,318; meaning they were operating 14% over capacity. There are reports of sterilization, mostly of women, being practiced at Western State; as at hospitals Norman, Vinita, Enid, and McAlister penitentiary.
Fort Supply was officially closed in September of 1894 and returned to the Department of the Interior on February 26, 1895.
The Fort Supply Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.  In 1988, the state legislature designated the remaining buildings at the old fort as the Fort Supply Historic District.The Oklahoma Historical Society currently administers five structures and a replica stockade as the Fort Supply Historic Site. Shortly after the 1988 ruling, the William S. Key Correctional Center (a privately owned correctional facility) was opened at the site. The grounds of the old post are also currently occupied by the Northwestern Center for Behavioral Health.
There are 961 persons buried here. The burial site contains graves of patients from a state-run mental hospital that took over the fort facilities. Plain, gray name markers date to 1908, the year Western State Hospital was established.
Sprinkled in among patient markers are older headstones of civilians affiliated with the military camp, opened in 1868 as a supply post for that year's winter campaign against the Plains Indians. Other graves may be those of squatters and homesteaders who moved in after the camp closed. Bodies of old soldiers formerly buried here were moved to Leavenworth, Kansas.
The most recent grave is that of former Western State Superintendent Dr. William Blyth, who died in 1982. The oldest represents Toch-e-me-ah, wife of Army scout Ben Clarke; Company B Indian Scout Bad Face, and three men believed to have been employees of the Quartermaster's Department.
Toch-e-me-ah's headstone, perhaps the tallest in the cemetery, indicates she died in 1875 at age 22.",,"Fort Supply, OK",,,1908,,,,1318,0
Oklahoma,Hissom Memorial Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hissom_Memorial_Center,1959,,1964,Closed,Cottage Plan,,,"In 1959 the two schools for children with mental retardation, epilepsy, and other mental issues operated by state mental health officials at Enid and Pauls Valley had become antiquated and overcrowded and dated back almost to statehood. The 52nd legislature recognized the need for additional beds to serve this rapidly growing population and appropriated one million dollars for the construction of a third institution on land donated by successful oilman Mr. and Wiley Hissom and his wife, 5 mi NW of Sand Springs, Oklahoma (near Tulsa).
Later, in 1961, an additional 7 million dollars was appropriated to complete construction and fully equip the facility to be named The Hissom Memorial Center. It opened on March 7th, 1964 to 1200 patients. It was at this time the institution removed it's caged cribs, and began to refer to itself at ""The City of Hope"". Among it’s 24 buildings were medical facilities and dorm-like residences which were seen as an improvement over the old turn-of-the-century institutions. At some point after 1970, part of the campus was used to house juvenile delinquents. This part of the property sat directly next to some of the boys' dormitories.
In the mid-1980s a group called Homeward Bound brought a 6 million dollar lawsuit against the center after a 7 year old patient, Jason George, was found to have bruises and bite marks when picked up by his mother. In hopes of closing it down and placing patients into communities and integrating them into society as much as possible, they contended it was more humane and much cheaper than institutionalization. Indeed, court-appointed observers reported a “prison-like atmosphere” and considered Hissom a “human-development emergency” and an “educational disaster.” The hospital continued operation, and a local newspaper records 51 abuse cases investigated by DHS among clients still living at Hissom as of July 11, 1991. Tranquilizing drugs were reported by a local newspaper as given to children considered ""hyper"" or problems in general. A federal judge ordered the facility closed in 1987, but it was 1994 when the last patient left and the center was mothballed.
In 2009, Oklahoma’s governor signed legislation authorizing the Oklahoma Department of Central Services to spend $3 million to demolish the site.",1994,"Sand Springs, OK",,,1964,1994,,1200,,0
Oklahoma,Norman State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norman_State_Hospital,,,1895 (as a mental health facility),Active,Cottage Plan,,Norman Institution for Violent Insane (Privately Owned) | State Hospital for the Insane | Oklahoma State Hospital | Central State Hospital  | Griffin Memorial Hospital,"The first structure on the hospital site actually was a school for women opened in the late 1800s. High Gate Academy couldn't compete with the nearby University of Oklahoma, and in 1895 it was sold to the Oklahoma Sanitarium Co. Mental patients who until that time had been sent by train to a facility in Illinois could now be treated at the Norman institution “for violent insane,” as a description on the facility's front gate stated.
In 1899, sanitarium officials hired David W. Griffin, a psychiatrist from North Carolina.
Griffin would become superintendent in 1902, a position he would hold until 1950. The sanitarium was sold to the fledgling state of Oklahoma, and in 1915, the legislative “Lunacy Bill” created several state asylums, including facilities at Fort Supply, Vinita and Norman. The Norman site became known as Central State Hospital.
Patient populations at the Norman hospital grew, reaching 3,000 in the 1950s. At times, conditions reported there, as at many similar institutions of the era, were grim, with overcrowding, inadequate heating and cooling and use of electric and insulin shock therapy, sterilizations, lobotomies and other approaches now considered inhumane. Patients might remain there for months or years.
Beginning in the 1960s, medical approaches to treating the mentally ill evolved, and laws and standards of care with them. “Deinstitutionalization” began to wind down the era of huge residential mental facilities, taking much of the expansive Central State Griffin Memorial Hospital, as it was renamed in 1953, with it.
By 1990, only 245 patients remained at Griffin Memorial, which no longer needed the comprehensive and self-sustaining infrastructure it once had. Today, Griffin's patient capacity is only 120, and stays are measured in weeks or days.
The worst fire in Norman history, measured by the lives lost, killed 38 men and boys in the Oklahoma State Hospital for mental patients on April 13, 1918. That may have been the largest fire death toll in Oklahoma history. The State Hospital on East Main Street was a forerunner of l the Griffin Memorial Hospital. The fire broke out at 4 a.m. on a Saturday, destroying two large buildings, described by The Norman Transcript as ""old frame"" structures, and a new building used as the dining hall. All 38 victims were in a first-floor ward housing 48 boys 10 to 15 years old, the newspaper reported. Apparently some victims were attendants. All 36 patients in a second-floor ward were rescued, led down an outside stairway ""by most strenuous efforts.""
Eighty patients in the other destroyed ward building were evacuated safely. Firefighters were able to put out the flames in a third ward building, and patients who had been moved out were able to return. Others were covered with blankets on the grounds until they could be placed in other buildings. The Transcript reporter had high praise for both members of the Norman Fire Department and the hospital's fire department. “There were numerous instances of bravery in going into burning buildings,"" the story said, ""but none of them take any special credit to themselves"". There was speculation that either an electrical defect or spontaneous combustion started the fire. A coroner's jury said the cause was unknown. Property damage was estimated at $25,000).
All but one of the bodies were burned beyond recognition and were buried Monday in one big grave in the northeastern part of the IOOF Cemetery. ""Everybody was laid in a neat coffin and given every kindly consideration possible,"" The Transcript said. Although the story: put the deaths at 37, The World Almanac calls it 38. Probably an injured patient died later.
The night watchman smelled smoke in the linen room of Oklahoma State Hospital Ward 14 at 3:45 a.m. , on a spring Saturday morning in 1918. He quickly sounded the steam whistle at the hospital's power plant to wake the sleeping patients. Nurses, ward watchmen, and other employees fought the fire with hand-held extinguishers and a one-hose stream.
Night-shift attendants bravely began trying to evacuate the men and boys from the ward and the sleeping room above them. Dr. D.W. Griffin was on the scene within minutes, organizing rescuers.
The south wind was blowing fire debris and quickly caught the dining room on fire. Flames caught Ward 13 and 16 on fire but all 88 patients were safely evacuated and the flames beaten back. In all, about 1,000 patients were housed in the sanitarium that spring.
Some of the patients were violent and the fire excited them even more, making the rescue more difficult. A few were confused and ran back into the buildings. Sitting on the grounds, the attendants wrapped the patients with blankets and took a head count: Thirty eight men and boys out of 48 patients in Ward 14 were dead, mostly smothered in their beds. It is believed to be the highest number of deaths in a single Oklahoma fire, just outdistancing the 36 killed in the Babbs Switch school fire on Christmas Eve in 1924. [1]
At the northeast corner of the property of Central State Hospital is Rock Creek Road Cemetery, with rows of small concrete pads marking graves of many patients. In another nearby cemetery is a communal grave containing remains of 38 of the 39 people who died in a fire at the hospital in 1918.
The Norman IOOF Cemetery now houses the remains of the Fire Victims of 1918. The Victims were given a granite memorial with all 38 names listed see Findagrave.com for photos of memorial with full name list",,"Norman, OK",,,1895,,,1000,3000,0
Oklahoma,Taft State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Taft_State_Hospital,1930,,1934,Active,Cottage Plan,,"Colored Deaf, Blind, and Orphan Institute | Taft State Hospital for the Negro Insane | Jess Dunn Correctional Center","In 1931, the Oklahoma Legislature approved the construction of a hospital for people who were both mentally ill and African American; prior to 1934 these patients were treated in separate wards at Central State Hospital in Norman, OK. An All-Black community previously known as Twine and later changed to Taft, 8 miles west of Muskogee was chosen as the building site.
Opened in 1934 to treat only African-American patients, and was unique in the country as it was run entirely by African American staff. Taft State Hospital is one of seven psychiatric facilities in the U.S. built ""exclusively to care for insane and idiotic negroes,” however the homeless, poor, and senile, were housed alongside the criminally insane and epileptic and mentally retarded; completely in violation of all state and national psychiatric standards.
As the only such hospital for African Americans in the state and one of only seven in the country, Taft State Hospital for the Negro Insane quickly overcrowded and understaffed by the 1940s.
The 1940 official report from the hospitals' medical superintendent claims 305 patients received during the year; 14% being over the age of 60, 16% for dementia, 5.9% for manic depressive psychosis and 16.7% having been admitted for Syphilis. The same report from 1940 claims 91 patients died at the hospital that year; 43% over the age of 60, 22% dying less than 1 month after being admitted. 
The institution housed 738 patients in 11 wards. The chief medical officer was Dr. E. P. Henry and was assisted by Dr. E. E. Bowser & Dr. C. E. Ford. In the same report the hospital is said to have employed 3 nurses and used treatments such as; X-Rays, hypoglycemic shock, metrazol shock, and fever therapy and in the report the medical superintendent asks the Governor for a hydrotherapy apparatus. Surgeries performed at the hospital included 10 major operations; numerous tonsillectomies and about 15 circumcisions in 1940 alone according to the medical superintendents report!
In 1940 the institutions housing was already overly full. 24 confirmed Tubercular patients were being housing in the regular wards along with other patients instead of in their own ward. Child patients with mental disabilities were not housed or treated separately from chronically ill children. Staff had just one room to live in (the Griffin Hospital superintendent had an entire house on the property, with nurses housed in their own apartments).
Meanwhile the larger institution had its own laundry on site, as well as a butcher, bakery, dairy, and farmland where most of the foods used were grown and cultivated by patients. Religious (mostly Christian) services were held on Sundays in the Dining Hall for patients. During warmer months outdoor activities consisted of baseball for the men, volleyball and handball for the females. Arguably most notably, the hospital boasted a chorus made up of over 30 patients.
In 1949 the State Government determined the consolidation of The Institute for Colored Blind, Deaf, and Orphans, The State Hospital for the Negro Insane, and The Training School for Negro Girls; (all had been located in or near Taft).
In 1964, state mental hospitals were desegregated and patients at Taft began to be moved to the state hospitals in Vinita and Norman, OK.
Closed in 1970 and converted into a correctional facility (the 3rd such state penitentiary to be placed in Taft by the state in the 100 years since it was founded as an All-African American town), which is still in operation today.",1970,"Taft, OK",,,1934,1970,,305,738,0
Oklahoma,Vinta State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Vinta_State_Hospital,1909,,1913,Active,Cottage Plan,,Eastern Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane | Eastern State Hospital | Oklahoma Forensic Center  | Northeast Oklahoma Correctional Center (current),"Eastern State Hospital has been a major factor in the economy of Craig County since 1913, and its influence in mental health matters has extended well beyond its service area. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, the mentally ill first were cared for through contract with private sanitariums. In Indian Territory, Cherokee Nation had maintained an asylum at Park Hill.
Eastern Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane was established by the Oklahoma State Legislature in 1909, to be located at Vinita, Craig County; on a 160 acre tract of land given to the State by the City of Vinita for this purpose. The land on which the hospital was established originally was owned by S.S. Cobb.
An appropriation was made to erect buildings, which were completed late in 1912. Dr. F.M. Adams was appointed August 12, 1912, by Governor Lee Croce as the hospital superintendent. His original four-year appointment stretched into a lifetime job. Dr. Adams served until his death in December 1955.
The first patients were received on January 28, 1913, when 300 people were transferred by special train from the Oklahoma Sanatorium at Norman. The special train was unloaded at a siding designated ""Asylum Spur,"" a little more than a mile south of the hospital. Wagons were sent to carry the women and a few older men, and the others walked to the new hospital.
During 1914 Building No. 3 was completed, and immediately 300 more patients were moved here from Norman. By 1954, the institution had a capacity of 2,600 patients and a capital investment of $6,541,050.
The hospital opened with two doctors, Dr. Adams and Dr. Edwin Williams, a physician from Philadelphia who had some experience with the mentally ill. He returned to the east about two years later, and Dr. P.I. Hays became assistant superintendent. Dr. Hays remained on the staff, succeeding Dr. Adams as superintendent and serving until October 1961. Both doctors were widely recognized for pioneering efforts in treatment of the mentally ill. The gradual expansion over the years, to the peak population of the mid-1950's, saw buildings steadily added, and more land acquired.
Facilities which were added included hospital wards for male and female patient, 1916; administration building, 1922; barn, implement sheds, greenhouse, new power house equipment in 1924; a fire station and sewage plant, 1930; a canning plant in 1938; central dining room, kitchen, a maximum restraint building for men, 1939; administration building, 1949; an employees' dormitory in 1953, named Adams Hall in honor of the long-time superintendent.
After Adams Hall was completed, a two-story house known as the ""Farm House"" was torn down. The house had been the home of Mr. and Mrs. S. S. Cobb before the hospital was established. For many years, most of the hospital employees were required to live on the grounds. Meals were provided as part of the salary. Some roomed in basements of ward buildings and others lived in two old barracks buildings, according to long-time employees. These buildings were moved in after World War Two.
During the years of peak patient population, the farm was an important economic factor. Swine, poultry, and dairy operations provided meat and milk, while garden produce was used fresh and also was canned for later use. Many farm-oriented patients worked alongside employees, and this provided valuable therapy.
The hospital's Holstein dairy herd was considered one of the best in the state, with some of the cattle setting production records and winning prizes at state fairs. The dairy was closed in 1968. Other farming operations were gradually phased out in the early 1970's. Through the first 40 years of the hospital's history, much of the patient care was custodial in nature. Staff was limited, but treatments, which were innovative at the time, were introduced.
Dr. Hays pioneered in many types of treatment, including luminal, sodium amytal, and various types of shock treatment. He was among the first to use malaria in treatment of syphilis. He was the first in the nation to use atropine sulphate as a treatment for Parkinsonian syndrome. In 1956, the ESH staff under Dr. Hays' direction took part in a research program to test the tranquilizing drugs Thorazine and serpasil.
Dr. Adams became recognized as one of the nation's foremost hospital administrators. Even with limited funds and staff, he pioneered in new types of treatment and psychotherapy. For his service in the field of mental illness, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in November 1954.
In 1947, the Hospital was renamed Eastern State. From that time forward, the state saw increased awareness of the needs of the mentally ill and increased funding which made possible more intensive, specialized treatment.
The dining room burned in 1951; a new central kitchen with men and women's dining rooms was built about five years later. Dr. W.C. Reed, Vinita dentist who had served the hospital part-time for 20 years, closed his private practice and became full-time dentist at ESH.
In 1951, Sam Seabolt became director of the Recreation Department. He remained on the staff 33 years, serving as Director of Activity Services, comprising occupational, recreational, music, work therapies, and volunteer services. Until 1983 he also supervised the chaplain and adult education services. A new medical service building was opened in 1952; in 1960 the building was named Hays Treatment Center in honor of Dr. P.L. Hays.
During the 1950's, the Rev. Moody Nicholson, who had been pastor of Vinita's Pilgrim Presbyterian Church, became full-time chaplain at the hospital. Later, an All Faiths Chapel was provided. Dr. A.D. Barrett is head chaplain.
In 1956 the first Department of Nursing was established, with Dorothy Hall, RN, a professional nurse administrator, as director.
When she took the post, ESH had six professional nurses and nearly 400 non-professional workers in psychiatric nursing, responsible for 72 ward units. By contrast, at the end of February 1984, the nursing department had 460 employees of whom 64 were Registered Nurses and 58 Licensed Practical Nurses. In 1984 the hospital was operating 18 ward units with a daily census of less than 400. Although more than 3,500 admissions were recorded in 1983, average length of stay was 39.6 days.
Volunteers have played a vital role in the hospital. Red Cross volunteers from Miami, Vinita, Claremore, Nowata devoted much time to work with patients. The Bartlesville Gray Ladies, who began weekly trips to ESH in 1955 and Gray Men, continue to serve, as have some Vinitans.
After the resignation of Dr. Hays, Dr. Wayne J. Boyd was superintendent until 1963. He was succeeded by Dr. Ruth V. Annadown, 1963-64. Dr. B.F. Peterson then came from Tennessee in July 1964 and headed the hospital until his death in 1972. Dr. A. Lawrence White served 1972-73; Dr. D.W. Shupe 1973-74; Dr. Joe Tyler 1974-78. Dr. Robert O'Toole became superintendent from October 1979 until February 1983, then Dr. Mason W. Robison assumed administrative duties.
In 1964, state mental hospitals were desegregated and patients at Taft were moved to the state hospitals in Vinita and Norman. In 1971 the first floor of Adams Hall was remodeled for administrative offices.
A dining room was located in the east wing of the Food Services Building. The changes in Food Service were especially evident. Dr. Peterson had believed that food was a factor in therapy. When men and women started having meals together, a noticeable improvement in personal appearance took place.
Outpatient services were begun in the 1960's to provide aftercare for discharged patients.
As the patient population declined, patients needing surgery have been transported elsewhere for care. The Medical Services do include a medical clinic, laboratory, X-ray, dental clinic, and pharmacy. During Dr. O'Toole's administration, ESH was designated as the treatment center for all inmates of the Department of Corrections requiring mental health services, and the hospital also handles all Oklahoma court-ordered observation-evaluation. Building 12 was completely renovated as a maximum security facility in 1983.
In 2008, a new state of the art 100,000 square foot building opened & the original hospital was turned over to the department of corrections.

By the end of the first fiscal year, there were 10 patients at the institution. The admission age was designated to be between 5 and 16 years, and the institution was for built as the state's Epileptic Home for Whites. During the 1911-1912 fiscal year, the patient count jumped to 64. The population at the school rapidly increased over the next few decades. By 1927, there were 554 patients: 247 of them male and 307 female. Just one year later, the patient count was up to 656.
As the patient count at the institute increased, so too would the number of activities and programs there. The institute added a slaughterhouse in 1928 and a bakery in 1929. In 1931, the institute’s farm had 90 cows, 36 of which were giving milk. There were 125 pigs, 60 of which were ready to kill. The farm additionally had 13 chickens, 50 guineas, 35 geese and 25 ducks. Produce also was  grown, including cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, turnips, watermelon and cantaloupes.
In 1935, Oklahoma Institute for the Feeble Minded was renamed Northern Oklahoma Hospital. By 1936, there were 1,049 patients at Northern Oklahoma Hospital. In 1945, the facility was up to 1,250 patients, but they were experiencing an overcrowding problem. Produce at the farm had increased to supply 8,880 pounds of tomatoes, 12,000 pounds of onions and 900 pounds of grapes, just to name a few crops. There there also was 3,694 pounds of hens, 1,875 pounds of turkey and 950 pounds of butchered beef.
Throughout the institution’s history, new buildings were built on campus and old ones were torn down. By 1954, there were eight female cottages and seven male cottages on campus. Boys and girls were made to live separately. The name of the institution was Northern Oklahoma Hospital until 1947, when it was renamed Enid State School. In 1985, it was renamed once again to become Northern Oklahoma Resource Center of Enid.
Plans to close the facility for the developmentally disabled were announced in 2012, and by 2014 it had been closed as a residential facility. The Robert M. Greer Center, which also is on the property, remains open. It houses several dozen patients and specializes in those with developmental disabilities and mental illness. Clients have moved in with family or into group homes with other developmentally disabled clients where available.
This cemetery is located at 30th Street and Breckenridge, on the grounds of NORCE. A tall metal arch at the entrance shows ""ENID STATE SCHOOL CEMETERY"" with the dates 1918-1985. There are approximately 135 burials here. This is a flat, grassed area with a handful of rather old trees.

Oklahoma,Pauls Valley State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pauls_Valley_State_School,1907,,1908,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Pauls Valley State Hospital | Southern Oklahoma Resource Center,"The Pauls Valley State School was established in 1907 as a state training school for boys. A year later construction began on a dormitory building, farm, and classrooms. The school focused on white boys aged 10-18 and used military discipline to correct the boys' behavior. Manual labor was performed by the boys such as farming and raising chickens. Over the years the school housed an average of 200 boys, and they would spend half their day in the classroom and the other half working the farm or other skills such as shoe-repair, engineering, printing, and laundering. Military drills were practiced for 30-minutes a day by all students.
In 1945, $45,000 was approved and appropriated by the State for two more buildings at the school: a detention and an observation home that would include a small dormitory, classroom, and a clinic; and a large dormitory meant to house 40 boys. The new dormitory became known as the ""Honor Building"", where boys could move after completing 3-months at the school with good record.
Boys were sentenced to the state school via the court system and for a myriad of reasons, ranging from petty theft to murder. In 1938, Daniel Van Horn, 15, and his 12 y/o accomplice were sentenced to 5 years at the training school for stealing $1.80 and a bicycle. Another boy, LE Goddard, was 12 y/o when he was sentenced to the training school for shooting and killing his 8 y/o cousin. He was first evaluated at the Eastern State Hospital for the Insane where he told officals ""they were telling lies on me"", but was determined to be sane with anger issues.
The training school was operated as such until converted to a state hospital for people with epilepsy in 1945 called Pauls Valley State Hospital, and then to a state facility for people with mental retardation in 1953. In 1992 Enid State School and Pauls Valley State School underwent another name change, and the two were renamed the Northern and Southern Oklahoma Resource Centers.
The Southern Oklahoma Resource Center (SORC) in Pauls Valley is a residential and habilitative facility, also classified as an intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation (ICF/MR). The majority of the persons who live at SORC have severe or profound mental retardation as well as other disabling conditions. The primary mission is to provide services that enhance the development of each individual and to provide opportunities that promote personal growth and independence. The Oklahoma Human Services Commission announced in November, 2012 the state’s plans to close the Southern Oklahoma Resource Center. It was closed July 2015.

Oklahoma,Oklahoma State Industrial School for Girls,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Industrial_School_for_Girls,,1915.0,1917,Active,Cottage Plan,,Russell Industrial School | Russell Industrial School for White Girls | Oklahoma State Industrial School for Incorrigible Girls | Girls Town | Oklahoma State Industrial School for White Girls | Central Oklahoma Juvenile Treatment Center | Central Oklahoma Juvenile Center (Current),"In 1907 the Russell Industrial School for White Girls, or the Russell Sage Foundation, was established in Oklahoma City close to the Capital building. It was a private institution caring for white girls placed in it's care by contract from the Governor when such girls were committed to the care of the Governor by the juvenile court system. A school library was formed by donations from ""Big Sister Clubs"" which included over 800 books and reading materials. At Christmas time, not only the girls at the Industrial School but also children at other orphanages, were ""adopted"" by women of the Big Sister Club and special received gifts.
In 1917 the school was adopted as a state industrial school and gradually became known as the ""State Industrial School for White Girls"". At this time the school was placed under the supervision of the State Board of Public Affairs. The Board stating ""Every girl admitted to this institution is clothed, fed, disciplined and instructed according to the rules and regulations of the institution, as are made by the Board."" 
Girls were released from the school when they were 18, or when they obtained special parole by the superintendent and the Board. If the girls were released early, the Board stated that she may be released to ""any resident of the State who is in good moral standing and with any additional stipulations as prescribed by the Board.""
The school and Board soon adopted a complex honors system wherein there were stages and a given time limit before girls were able to be selected to ""move up"" in the system. Upon entry to the school girls automatically were at the level of ""Probationer"" which they stayed at for at least 3 months. She may then be promoted to the ""Climbers"" group, and at the end of another 2 months, the ""Honor"" group. In another month she may then enter the ""Honor Stripe"" which she must wear 3 months before she is eligible for parole. The highest honor, carrying extra responsibilities but with a higher chance at parole.
In 1919 the State Legislature appropriated money for buildings for the school, with an additional $44,000 being appropriated if the Board decided to move the school from its current position close to the Capital buildings in Oklahoma City. Under the provisions of this act the school was moved to Tecumseh in September 1921 and given the official renaming to the Oklahoma State Industrial School for White Girls. The school was set on 30-acres of a 147.7-acre plat of land where it still exists today.
Construction on new buildings began soon after moving to Tecumseh in 1921 and included; employees' buildings, a main schoolhouse building, laundry, two girls cottages, a playground, infirmary, bath house, and a bakeshop, as well as roads and sidewalks, a sewer system, and a number of cows, hogs, and chickens as well as housing for the livestock.
In 1926 they added the following wood-framed buildings to the school; vocational building, dining hall, community house, a brick storehouse, and additional poultry houses. In 1928 the Board approved adding two additional brick cottages to the school property, adding two more in 1930.
In 1931 there were 222 ""inmates"", or girls, at the school. In 1934 there were 248 girls living at the school, and they were given an education through 8th grade. After 8th grade the education given was mainly vocational, typewriting or stenography. To discipline the girls matrons often removed honors, however the school also had what they called a ""gloom house"". Described by the superintendent, the gloom house was a ""3-room building with modern conveniences, electric lights and water"", but was in fact a jail with concrete walls and steel-barred cells. When girls were deemed not worthy of interacting with other girls they were confined to the jail for a period. For example an account from 1933 when 2 girls were punished in this way for thinning each others eyebrows. The matrons also resorted to ""spanking"" the girls with belts. For using vile language or fighting a girl might be spanked, with the spanking being witnessed by 4 other members of the staff (often men), and is done by a woman. The administrators and matrons believing about the public spanking that ""The humiliation awakens the girl, especially if witnessed by male members of staff, as the girls do not like them to know that they have been naughty as the men umpire their games, take them on hikes and sometimes hunting"" as was an account from a matron in 1934. (Under the administration preceding the one in power in 1934 even more objectionable methods of control were being used such as Saltpeter.)
Now known as the Central Oklahoma Juvenile Center, the school buildings have been demolished and built up again over the years. It was previously operated by the Department of Human Services but has been under the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Office of Juvenile Affairs since 1995. It is one of Oklahoma's ""secure treatment facilities"" where ""residential programs provide rehabilitative for treatment to the Office of Juvenile Affairs' youth, who have been adjudicated as Youthful Offenders or delinquents and placed in OJA custody.""
The COJC sits directly on the same 30-acres of the original 147.7-acre plat. It is a co-ed center and has 72 beds.[1][2][3][4]",,"Tecumseh, OK",,,1907,,72,,248,0

Oklahoma,Oklahoma State School for the Deaf,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_School_for_the_Deaf,1898,,1898,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"In 1898 the Territorial School for the Education of the Deaf was founded in Guthrie Oklahoma. Deaf children who were previously being schooled at Fort Gibson alongside blind students and others were transferred to the new school at Guthrie. Mr and Mrs Eilsworth Long, a well-educated deaf couple, were either the founders or instrumental in founding the school. A few weeks after opening the school however, Mr Long spoke with the Territory officials and found he did not have the means to carry on the school himself and turned the management over to Mr H C Beamer and his wife.
Mr Beamer received a contract from the territorial authorities for $275.00 per school year. This was later changed to monthly allowances of $275.00. Mr Beamer oversaw the erection of buildings to house and launder 60 pupils. Meanwhile in 1902 Mrs Pearl Dunham became principle of the school under Mr Beamers superintendency. She was the daughter of deaf parents and taught sign language. Previous to this Mrs Dunham had been principle at the Kansas State School for the Deaf for a number of years. 
In 1906 Mr R N Dunham became head of the institution and received so many applications to the school that they built two additional buildings that were ready for use when the school opened in the fall of 1906. This increased the pupil capacity to 90 students, with applications still being turned away. The school during this time has increased to having 9 teachers on staff.
As the territory became a state in 1907 these buildings were left on Mr Dunham's hands as the state moved the school to Sulphur and did not claim the buildings. This left Mr Dunham at a financial loss, as the state typically bought the existing buildings to avoid personal damages but did not in this case. 
There had also been a department at the territorial school for ""deaf Negroes"". This department was under the same management as the greater school, but separate quarters and separate instruction/classrooms were used. The ""Negro department"" continued for one year after the school was moved to Sulphur. In 1909 a single school for deaf, blind, and orphan black children was opened at Taft, OK.
The school at Sulphur opened in the fall of 1908 with some of the same teachers who had taught at the Guthrie school. The first 5 years at Sulphur the superintendent was Mr A A Stewart, who had previously been superintendent at the Kansas State School for the Deaf. The school during 1908 and 1909 operated at full capacity of 200 pupils, in a 3-story building with basement located near the still standing Artesian Hotel. In 1910 the school expanded into what was called the Metropolitan Hotel, using part of the hotel for classrooms, an industrial department, and for teachers' living quarters.
Construction to build a new location for the school seems to have started in 1911 about 1/2 east and south of where the final school now stands, however there was fraud and the buildings were so poorly constructed they fell in during construction. The final abandonment of this site seems to have been also caused by a compliant filed with the State Board of Affairs by a prominent Sulphur citizen.
Building on the present site began in 1912. The administration building, little boys dormitory, and big girls dormitory were the first buildings to be erected on the new site and were occupied by fall 1913. The superintendent and his family had a room of suites in the administration building. Many of the teachers and all the supervisors lived on campus in various buildings. The old power house and laundry buildings were finished in 1913, with an addition of a boiler room in 1930.
There was a wood-framed dining hall and kitchen building just east of the administration building which was replaced by a 3-story building in 1916. In the new building the lower level was used for a kitchen, storeroom, bakery, teachers dining hall and cold storage. The second level, or middle level, was used for children and other employee dining hall. The third, top level, was used as a dormitory for large boys. In 1938 additional space was added to this building for the same uses as stated previously. In 1917 a hospital building was built complete with nurses' quarters.
The increase in attendance caused a demand for more dormitory room, so in 1918 a dormitory was built for intermediate girls. In 1925 the superintendent's home was finished. There were 2 buildings built in 1927, the gymnasium and the storeroom. The old vocational building was built in 1920 and used until 1932 when a new vocational building was finished. The new vocational school held a cabinet shop, printing shop, dry cleaning, and tailor shop, sewing rooms, home economics rooms, art rooms, and beauty culture rooms.  By 1939 the vocational building was being used as a dormitory for large boys and as a boys' study hall.
""Blattner Hall"", a primary building, was built in 1929 with room to accommodate approx. 120 of the youngest pupils. Blattner Hall allows these pupils to have their dormitories, classrooms, dining hall, kitchen, and play rooms all in one building.
The campus was greatly improved during the summer of 1934. The athletic field was leveled, requiring the removal of several large boulders, all the driveways were guttered and paved, and drains were built to carry off drainage water. In 1937 the WPA constructed a 4-ft high fence made of uncoursed natural sandstone that runs throughout the campus. In 1939 the campus boasted 13 fireproof buildings and one storeroom shed. In 1961 major renovation began on all school buildings, with renovations being completed in 1980. In 1999 a new renovation project was begun and completed in 2002.",,"Sulphur, OK",,,1908,,,,200,0
Oklahoma,Oklahoma State School for the Blind,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_School_for_the_Blind,1897,,,Active,,,Parkview School,"In 1897 Miss Lura A. Rowland, a graduate of the Arkansas School for the Blind and ""a frail wisp of a girl,"" solicited funds and undertook to establish a school for the blind children of Indian Territory at Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. She operated the school without any government assistance for ten years, though there are reams of correspondence indicating she implored governors, congressmen, and other public officials to assist her struggling organization. She did present a case sufficient to be permitted the use of the old Barracks Building to house her school. (Land owned by the Cherokee nation but leased by the Federal Government.)
Miss Rowland traveled all over Indian Territory, appearing before the various tribal councils, presenting her needs. Since few Native Americans were blind until Europeans brought diseases causing blindness to the tribes, there was not the acceptance that might have been the case otherwise. During the first four years the institution was supported solely by contributions from the people of the Indian Territory and sympathizing states. In 1900 the Choctaw and Cherokee Nations each made appropriations for the education of blind Choctaw and Cherokee children. Repeated but unsuccessful efforts were made to have Congress aid the school through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1907 the school became a state-supported institution. The school was moved to Wagoner but soon returned to Fort Gibson.
Oklahoma's first legislature appropriated $5,000 on May 29, 1908, for the maintenance of the ""Lura A. Lowrey School for the Blind"". As a state institution the school was supported by legislative appropriations, varying from twenty to thirty thousand dollars yearly. It remained in temporary quarters at Fort Gibson until June, 1913, when the fourth legislature acted to move it to Muskogee, Oklahoma.
Upon moving the school to Muskogee in 1911, first in a couple of temporary locations locally, the state began construction on several beautiful buildings of English architecture with steep roofs. 1913 Oklahoma School for the Blind was moved to its present location in June in accordance with an act of the fourth Legislature. An 80 acre tract of land was donated by Governor C.N. Haskell. The tornado of 1945 destroyed most of those roofs, demolished the gymnasium, in which three girls were killed, and wounded several others. In the rebuilding, flat roofs replaced the originals.",,"Muskogee, OK",,,1897,,,,,0

He was treated for typhoid fever before the building was even completed. The first nurse was Miss Ida Ferguson.
A training school for nurses was established at the El Reno Sanitarium in 1903. It was the first hospital in the state to adopt a regular course of training and graduate a class of trained nurses. Miss Floy Ben Bow was the first graduate in 1904. Candidates for admission had to be in good health, educated and possess good common sense. They were on three month’s probation to see whether they were suitable to enter the school. The student nurses worked nine hours during the day and ten hours at night.  They were allowed a half day off during the week and a half day each Sunday.
In 1912 Dr. Thomas M. Aderhold bought the sanitarium and became owner as well as Chief of Staff.

The land was originally bought by Walter Hardy's parents in 1895. The original building sat at the corner of Caddo and Main streets and the sanitorium operated on the 2nd floor when it first opened with Ramsey's Drug on the 1st floor. The basement was home to the Dew Drop Inn, a notorious saloon for gunslingers an prostitutes. It is rumored there was also a network of tunnels running from the basement of this building, across the street to the nearby hotel and cafe.
It seems the Sanitorium was rebuilt at the same location after original building burnt down sometime in the early 1900s or 1910s.
Sometime before 1921 a new location was chosen for a newer, larger Hardy Sanitorium located at the corner of 1st SW and B Street.
In 1921, the sanitorium is reported to have had 60 1-bed rooms, with Dr Walter Hardy as the chief surgeon and Mrs Walter Hardy as the superintendent.
In 1924, the sanitorium is reported to have had the same 60 beds, 3 graduated nurses, 10 nurses currently in training, and 9 additional nurses without training.
The Hardy Sanitorium was closed down in 1955 when the Carter County Memorial Hospital was opened. It seems after years of neglect the building fell down, and was cleaned up and replaced by the new Ardmore Post Office.
In November 1930, Dr Hardys brother, Andrew Hardy was arrested on the accusation of murdering his wife with a shotgun shot to her face. Andrew Hardy had reported the killing as an accident, saying the gun fell and discharged as his wife drove their car on a hunting expedition. Andrew was however charged with murder when a nearby farmer, Mitch Ligon (a black man), reported to the police having seen Andrew chase down his wife in a field and shoot her. 30 days later while Andrew was awaiting trial, the deputy charged with investigating his case, Deputy Con Keirsey, was involved in a shoot out trying to apprehend 2 car thieves. Deputy Keirsey was taken to Hardy Sanitorium and died in the care of Dr Walter Hardy 10 hours later. In Feb of the following year, witness Mitch Ligon was shot and injured in a reported ""spat with a friend over money"", and another black man who was to testify in the trail would be found dead of drowning before the trail could begin. 
Andrew Hardy's trial finally began in the Spring of 1931 and attendence was the largest Cart County has seen for a trail. Ligon testified and Andrew declared he was a ""lying negro"". Andrew also denied allegations from his mother-in-law that was in love and having an affair with the Carter County Attorney's secretary. Another witness, Ms Viola Ross, was accused of being an untrustworthy witness by the defense because one of her children was reportedly fathered by a black man. Ms Ross' children were brought into court and paraded in front of the jurors, to show that one child had darker skin and black, wavy hair. State prosecutors would show that Andrew had taken out several life insurance policies on his wife just months before her death, that other nearby farm workers had heard a woman screaming before the shot, and that no blood-splatter or shotgun pellet marks were found inside the automobile. Prosecutors also presented several post office employees who claimed to have seen nude photographs of Andrew Hardy and the secretary, Edna Stewart, together.

Oklahoma,Buffalo Park Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Buffalo_Park_Sanatorium,,,,Closed,Single Building,,,"After saving one of Pawnee Bill's workers at one of his entertainment shows, Pawnee Bill and Dr. WM Moore of New Jersey gained a strong friendship. Between 1908 and 1909 Pawnee Bill's wife was taken to be treated at Dr Moores' sanatorium in New Jersey several times to be treated by him for an adenectomy and a carriage accident, as well as other illnesses. 
1909 Dr Moore sold his sanatorium in New Jersey and brought his sister Margaret with him as he moved to Pawnee Oklahoma to open a new sanatorium. His sister would serve as his nurse. He, however, left his wife Hettie and daughter at home in New Jersey - they would never follow him perminately to Oklahoma.
The original hospital opened in 1909 in white canvas tents in the middle of one of Pawnee Bill's buffalo pastures. Being the only medical facility around, in this era the hospital performed routine surgeries, birthed babies, and treated all types of illness on the frontier.
Yet the plans for the eventual sanatorium were grand and drawn by architect Fred Oll and included 2 large towers with wings extending off each. While the actual plans for the building never materialized, it was still quite modern when finished. The sanatorium had a water filtration system, the newest medical instruments, an operation room enclosed by glass, heat and air, an onsite laboratory, a kitchen, and was beautifully furnished with luxury furniture and fixtures. The sanatorium was completely funded by Dr Moore. The Buffalo Park sanatorium quickly had a waitlist for patients, with people coming from every county in Oklahoma to be treated by Dr Moore.
On February 12, 1914 at 10:45am stood in front of the mirror in his bedroom inside the Buffalo Park Sanatorium, placed a revolver to his temple and pulled the trigger. His nurse heard the gunshot and ran into his quarters to find him dead. He left no suicide note, and friends felt there was no warning as Dr Moore's hospital was successful and he had seemed cheerful in the days before. His sister notified his wife in New Jersey via telegraph. His suicide made headlines in newspapers across the state of Oklahoma and is still spoken of today in the town of Pawnee. Margaret Moore spent the rest of her life in Pawnee. Beacuse of the unexpected nature of his death, rumors at the time eluded to the death of Dr Moore as being a murder instead of a suicide but no evidence can be found to credit these rumors with any validity. (His nurse found him almost immediately, having herself heard the single gunshot.) There was an official panel of inquest held and multiple doctors attested to the medical evidence lending to a suicide, and not a murder.
The property where the Buffalo Park Sanatorium was built on was leased to Dr Moore and so after his death the property reverted to the family of Pawnee Bill. In 1915 Pawnee Bill deeded the property to the building, joining the two toghether and then the same day sold both to the Arkansas State Bank for $4,000. Pawnee Bill happened to be a major stock holder in the Arkansas State Bank.
A short time later another doctor bought the Buffalo Park Sanatorium and began running it again with much success. How long the sanatorium was open and running under this new doctor is unknown, but we do know that the building became a private residence in later years. The building still stands in Pawnee and has been beautifully restored to near original state, and some in town say that it is haunted.",,"Pawnee, OK",,,1909,,,,,0

It would be located only about half a mile from the Eastern Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium.  By 1916, the building had remained unfinished and it was contemplated that the hospital would serve general patients as well as tubercular cases despite what had been proposed.  Recommendations from the Bureau of Indian Affairs urged that the site remain as primarily a tuberculosis hospital, not only for the recovery of patients in a location that fit will with contemporary treatment ideas, but also to segregated the infected from the rest of their tribe.  The hospital opened in 1917, and the next year it was home to twenty patients, mostly youths.[3]  It had a projected capacity of sixty patients.
1921 saw many of the same remarks from Bureau of Indian Affairs officials; there were no Choctaw or Chickasaw tribe members on staff, meaning physicians and nurses had difficulty communicating with many of their patients.  It was also still being widely used to house non-TB patients without any separation from each other.[4].  Conditions were similar in 1930 when the superintendent, Dr. William van Cleave, testified to Congress that the sanatorium regularly ""crowd more in"" than its sixty bed capacity.  Patients included syphilis sufferers as well as TB patients.[5]  Throughout the years, the hospital reported difficulty keeping patients through the full treatment regimen.
In 1939, the tribe conveyed the hospital and land to the federal government.[6] 1942 saw the sanatorium allocated $203,604 by the federal government.[7]  This followed up significant New Deal era Public Works Administration spending in the mid-1930s including more than $56,000 in 1934 for conservation and construction work.[8]  With the decline in tuberculosis patients those that remained were moved to state facilities in 1963.[9]",1963,"Talihina, OK",,,1917,1963,60,,,0
Oklahoma,Eastern Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Eastern_Oklahoma_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,1919,1921.0,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Eastern Oklahoma State Sanatorium | Oklahoma State Tuberculosis Sanatorium | Oklahoma Veterans Center in Talihina,"In 1919 Oklahoma legislature passed a law authorizing the establishment of 3 state sanatoriums. At this time, $50,000 was allotted for the Negro sanatorium at Boley, $100,000 each for the 2 sanatoriums for whites; Eastern Oklahoma State Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Talihina, and Western Oklahoma State Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Clinton.
Eastern Oklahoma State Tuberculosis Sanatorium was opened November 1, 1921 with facilities for 50 patients. The sanatorium is located 800 ft above Kaimichi Valley, upon Winding Stair Mountain, 3 1/2 miles  NW of the town of Talihina. The buildings in 1921 included the administration building, a wood frame pavilion, and 3 wood frame cottages. The administration building held: on the 1st floor- the general offices, laboratory, drug room, xray room, operating room, examination room, kitchen, and dining room; on the 2nd floor were rooms for the female employees. The pavilion had screened-in porches and private changing rooms, giving the patients fresh mountain air while in bed on sleeping porches.
At the time of opening in 1921, it was generally thought that the principle function of a sanatorium was not so much curative as it was for the isolation of old chronic cases of tuberculosis. Therefore, many of the first admissions were more advanced and hopeless cases.
In 1924 an additional hospital building was built, giving the institution 50 more beds and raising its patient limit to 100; which soon became inadequate for the Eastern half of the state. It was a 2-story, fireproof brick building with patient rooms situated to face South. Each patient had an individual room with hot and cold running water, toilet and linen closet, which opened to a screened-in porch by two French doors. The building also held a new kitchen, pharmacy, treatment room, and 2 general work rooms. 
The sanatorium also had a power house, laundry, recreation building, and steam plant (for heating building and sanitizing operating and cooking utensils.)
Methods used during this time in the treatment of Tuberculosis were artificial pneumothorax (a surgical treatment to collapse the lung by inserting air or nitrogen into the pleural space), heliotherapy (the therapeutic use of sunlight), rest, fresh air, and wholesome food.
The Recreation building was used to teach recovering patients a new vocation suitable for his/her new physical condition, so that he/she may not be a burden on the community when released. Entertainment such as ""moving picture shows"" and plays were also shown once a week in the Recreation building for patients well enough to attend.
In July 1925, the Legislature approriated $45,000 for a new nurses home on the grounds. A 2-story, brick fireproof building, completed April 1926, had a small kitchen & laundry in the basement, as well as a large living room and fireplace on each floor.
In October 1927, construction began on a new service building to be completed in 1928. The new building held a new kitchen, a large dining room for patients, store, cold storage rooms, a large auditorium, and more quarters for employees upstairs.
In November 1928 the EOTS (Eastern Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium) had a capacity of 100 patients and was caring for 120, with a waiting list of another 100 patients. There were currently no TB hospitals for children in the state and there were estimations of 12,000 Oklahomans in need of TB treatment at the time.
In 1930 a 65-bed children's building was added to the campus and named the Harper Building. The Harper building was 2-stories with a central room and wings on each side. The South wing consisted of sleeping porches while the North of dressing rooms. The central room on the 1st floor was used as a reception room for visitors, a head nurses office, treatment room, dining hall and kitchen. The central room on the 2nd floor held two isolation wards with 4 beds each, two nurses' rooms, a solarium, and a school room for children who had their education interrupted by illness. At the time of building completion, the sanatorium already had a wait list exceeding 65 children.
By 1931 the campus had seen some improvements. A mile long cast iron water main was connected to the main town line at Talihina, a dairy barn boasting 24 milking cows, the administration building was remodeled, shrubs and trees were planted on the lawns with stumps and rocks removed, and sidewalks were layed connecting all buildings. The sanatorium also acquired a new x-ray machine at this time, the first of it's kind made by the General Electric Company.
In 1932, a 3-story infirmary building for women was constructed with an 80-bed capacity. The building was used to take care of more advanced female patients, and also as a receiving ward. It was at this time in 1932 that many evergreen trees were planted among the buildings on campus.
In 1936 a new milk building was constructed, a brick building boasting one of the best milk plants in Oklahoma. The new equipment included a 200-gallon pasteurizing machine. Equipment was also purchased to enable this plant to produce other milk products like butter, cottage cheese, and buttermilk.
In 1937 the largest building to be constructed at EOTS was completed at a cost of $184,000. It was 3-stories, plus a large basement, and added 140 beds to the capacity limit. At the time of completion the waiting list for patients was more than 100 men and more than 100 women. Therefore, immediately after the building was opened it filled to capacity, and the building continuously carried over 160 patients. Each wing of the building was segregated from the other, with men in the East wing and women in the West wing.
There was a large elevator in the middle of the building, and also a motorized dumb waiter for carrying food. It was the first building on campus to have an incinerator connected on each floor for burning items from patients (tissues, napkins, etc.). In the basement was located the refrigeration plant which took care of refrigeration and ice for all buildings. On the 1st floor were the kitchen and dining room for the building, reception and waiting room, nurses office, chart room, and examination room. Throughout the building and in each room there was an electric call system which registered in the halls on each floor and then on the first floor in the nurses office.
By this time, the sanatorium changed from the isolation of old chronic cases of tuberculosis, to a more curative approach. Because there had never been enough room at the sanatorium for all Oklahomans suffering from TB, it was now considered more advisable to admit patients who would only need hospitalized from 9 months - 1 year and would be able to return to the community. Outpatient consultation and diagnostic service became offered to doctors throughout the state. Phrenicneurectomy and Thoracorplasty (a surgical procedure that was originally designed to permanently collapse the cavities of pulmonary tuberculosis by removing the ribs from the chest wall) operations were added to the list of treatments at the sanatorium during this time.
The 1940's saw the introduction of several tuberculosis drugs, as well as better social and economic conditions throughout the nation. The drugs continued to improve, leading to less need for hospitalization and shorter stays when needed.
In 1941 hospitalization for children with primary TB was discontinued, as it was opinion tha they did not require it. In 1948 the Harper children's building was remodeled into employee housing. 
In 1952 two wings were added to the Infirmary building, adding 100-beds to it's capacity. A new dining room and kitchen were added to the building at this time as well.
The 1960's saw the closing of the Indian Sanatorium at Shawnee, the Talihina Indian Tuberculosis Unit, and the tuberculosis unit at Veterans Hospital in Sulpher. In 1972 Western Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Clinton was closed and and all patients were transferred to Eastern. By the only 30 - 40 percent of TB patients needed hospitalization and their average stay was about 90 days.
In 1973 the name of Eastern Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium was officially changed to Oklahoma State Sanatorium by the state legislature. The sanatorium had a bed capacity of 150 at this time, and most patients admitted were over 50 years old. With the inpatient load continually decreasing at the sanatorium, the State Health Department ordered staff physicians greater responsibility for outpatient care across the state.
By 1975 it was decided to close this Sanatorium due to declining need and advanced treatments. Today the facility houses a VA hospital and some of the original buildings are still standing.",,"Talihina, OK",,,1921,1975,150,,160,0
Oklahoma,Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium for Colored,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oklahoma_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium_for_Colored,,,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Boley State Tuberculosis Sanatorium,"During the early part of the 20th century, Boley Oklahoma was one of the wealthiest Negro towns in the US. It boasted the first nationally chartered bank owned by blacks, and its own electric company.[10] The town had over 4,000 residents by 1911, and was the home of two colleges: Creek-Seminole College, and Methodist Episcopal College. The Masonic Lodge was called ""the tallest building between Okmulgee and Oklahoma City,"" when it was built in 1912.[9] Booker T. Washington visited Boley in 1905, and was so impressed that he included Boley in his speeches. Outlaw Pretty Boy Floyd was gunned down by officers here after trying to rob the African American owned Boley Bank.
Originally built on land donated by the town to the state, the sanatorium was completed in 1923. 2 years later in 1925, the sanatorium patients were transferred to a seperate building on the campus of Eastern Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Talihina. The sanatorium was converted into the State Training School for Negro Boys at that time and remained so until 1983 when it was again converted, this time into the present day John Lilley Correctional Center, holding more than 800 inmates.",,"Boley, OK",,,1923,1925,,,,0

In additional to caring for Tuberculosis patients, the home provided general medical hospital care including surgery, coronary care and dialysis treatment. Later, those beds were converted to nursing care beds for the elderly.
The grounds eventually grew to hold a 2-story limestone administration building, and several wood framed, cottage-like buildings trimmed in white. Nearby were ample pastures of wild flowers, groves of Elm and Oak, and a large pasture for grazing Buffalo.

A year later, in 1922, the Western Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium was established in Clinton and the Soldiers' Tubercular Sanatorium was created in Sulphur, OK. These became the mainstays of tuberculosis treatment in Oklahoma. The City of Clinton donated 100 acres of land one mile south of the city for the Western Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium which opened April 3, 1922 with beds for 100 patients.
In 1931, the Negro sanatorium at Boley, OK closed and patients were given a separated building at Western State Sanatorium. By the time it closed in 1975, it had grown to 356 beds. The  Clinton Veterans Center now occupies these grounds; few of the WOTS buildings that were in operation are still on the grounds.
The cemetery is located on the Veterans Center property. It was severely overgrown and being used as part of a livestock grazing area. The grave markers are a flat concrete slabs with handmade brass plates attached to them. A group from the Southwestern State University unearthed grave markers with a metal detector in 2012.

Oklahoma,Okmulgee County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Okmulgee_County_Poor_Farm,,,,Demolished,,,Okmulgee County Almshouse,"Information on the internet about County Farms in Oklahoma is difficult to find. However, a reference was stumbled upon which stated the farm was located within the SW/4 of Section 16 in Township 13 North, Range 13 East. This describes a ½ mile square, or 160 acres, located on the northeast corner of 36th street and Mission in Okmulgee. It was not stated how many acres were owned by the county within this 160-acre description. Depending upon the size and type of operation, 20 to 160 acres, would certainly not be unreasonable. Less than 20 acres would seem to be insufficient and more than 160 acres seems large by today’s standards. However, the yield per acre was less then, as compared to now, so 160 acres cannot be discounted.
These Poor Farm buildings can be seen in decades old aerial photographs held by the public library. Now gone, the residents and farm buildings were located about 1/3 mile east of Mission on the north side of 36th street. The main buildings set back about 300 feet from the road. After the buildings were demolished, a residence was constructed about 150 feet southwest of their location and is still in use. [1]
The Okmulgee Cemetery has an area designated for the poor, also known as potter’s field. Other nearby towns have cemeteries with potter’s fields as well. The discovery of a large county-owned potter’s field is not expected based upon what is known, but cannot be ruled out entirely. The Okmulgee Cemetery is only 1.5 miles from the County Farm and could easily have been used for their burials. The Okmulgee Cemetery has been in continuous operation for 111 years.
In 1971 the Genealogical Society of Okmulgee produced their book entitled “Cemetery Records of Okmulgee County Oklahoma”. In it they documented what they referred to as Okmulgee County Cemetery – Potter’s Field. Following is an excerpt: ""A small cemetery grown up to weeds and brush. It is south of Okmulgee Country Club in the SW1/4 section of the SW1/4 of Section 16 R13E T13N. Only 4 marked graves were found but field stones and rusted funeral home markers identified 25 other locations of burial. Names on the 4 marked graves as follows: Baker, Arthur Nov. 1 1876 - July 29 1935 , Baker, Frank L Jan. 13 1880 - Aug. 15 1938 , Meek, John died 3/8/1919 aged 21 y/o (Mortuary record) , Osborn, Ina Apr. 29 1916 - Aug. 17 1933 , Smith, Austin D. Nov. 22 1941 aged 1 day , Winkler, Charles Samuel E. died 10/23/1918 aged 32 y/o (Mortuary record)."" Note that the location given is an area of 40 acres.
In November 2020 an OCGS member noticed a burial card, dating from 1941, which mentioned a man who had been “buried at the Okmulgee county farm”. The name, Frank Grether, led to an obituary which also stated he had lived at the county farm. At 73, he had lived at the farm only 4 months and was ill the entire time. Otherthan being a “transient - sheep farmer from Wyoming”, nothing about him or his family had been mentioned by him prior to his death. 
Another OCGS member in 2020 launches his own campaign to find the ""Potters Field"" cemetery of Okmulgee. He explored the grounds and found 2 additional grave markers, both being metal funeral plaques with sliding letters. The plaques read as follows in 2020 (keep in mind letters may have shifted or fallen off through the years): ""ULIAA SHIN 1919-1936 , DWAIN SMITH 1941-1941"". Although not quite legible both markers appear to be from Buchanan Funeral Home. Interestingly, the 1971 inventory mentioned finding an Austin D. Smith who died in 1941 at age 1 day. Could these be one person named Austin Dwain Smith and the temporary marked grave had a stone added later? No evidence of any stone marker for Austin D Smith was found in 2020.",,"Okmulgee, OK",,,,,,,,1
Oklahoma,Tulsa County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tulsa_County_Poor_Farm,,1921.0,1921,Demolished,,,Tulsa County Farm | Tulsa County Home,"Farm buildings being built in 1921, the County Farm was described at the time as being ""480 acres situated 8 miles East of Tulsa"". The County Farm, often described as the Poor Farm, was created in an era where there was no Federal Welfare and charity was strictly the responsibility of the local government. In it's hey-day the farm reportedly boasted 260 beef and milk cattle, 300 chickens, and 75-80 hogs, not to mention the work animals such as mules and horses, and a large number of vegetable gardens.
The Farm was surrounded by controversy since the beginning. There were rumors and reports in local newspapers of misdoings, political byplay, and on various occasions arguments about converting the 480-acre farm into a county hospital or selling the land on the open market. However in 1942 the Farm was still operating much the same as it had in the beginning, canning 9,240 cans of vegetables that year and winning several blue ribbons for it's cattle.
However, in 1939 the Farm and its then superintendent Ed Lantz came under public scrutiny when a local newspaper reported that County Inspector Mabel Bassett called the farm a ""local nescience"" after an inspection. She gave the Tulsa County commissioners 24 hours to remove Lantz or she would institute a court action to have him discharged. Lantz resigned only after charges were filed against him by County Attorney Dixie Gilmer. ""There are very unsanitary conditions throughout the home,"" Bassett reported. ""The kitchen is dirty, the rooms adjoining are filthy, the plumbing is in terrible condition and the odors and stench are nauseating.""
But by 1960, the Federal Government was in the Welfare business in a big way, and the county poor farm model was on its way out. The animal population had dwindled to 1 mule and 5 guinea hens. The mule, known as ""Old Jen"" was slated for the slaughter house until a group of local citizens rallied for her to instead ""retire"" on another local farm.
The property became the LaFortune Park & Golf Course it is today with construction beginning shortly after 1960, funded by Tulsa oilman and Mayor J.A. LaFortune. Meanwhile, Tulsa County was using the buildings on the farm property to house their County Department of Social Services and store records, but in 1977 they moved across town to the new $1 million County Complex and the buildings were demolished shortly after to add to the Golf Course area.",1961,"5516 E 51st St. Tulsa, OK",,,1921,1960,,,,1

Oklahoma,Atoka Baptist Academy,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Atoka_Baptist_Academy,1902,,1895,Active,,,Murrow Indian Orphan Home | Murrow Indian Home and Mission | Murrow Home | Atoka Baptist Orphanage,"In 1885 Rev. Joeseph Samuel Murrow, who had previously (1867) ran a public school in Atoka with his wife and also took in several Native American orphans, requested the Choctaw and Chickasaw Baptist Association establish a Baptist Academy at Atoka. After the Atoka Baptist Academy ceased to function as a school, Rev. Murrow secured many donations of small portions of the land allotments from adult full-bloods among the Choctaw Tribe. These small portions, together with a grant of 1,790 acres from the Choctaw Tribe itself, provided a new site for the now-named Murrow Indian Orphans Home at Unchuka, which was near what is now Coalgate, OK.
The new Orphanage and Mission opened January 1, 1902. At the farm of 45,000 acres some temporary buildings were erected and a little later the school building and one of the dormitory buildings in Atoka were torn down and removed to the farm where they were re-erected and afford comfortable quarters, though still inadequate. They lacked farm equipment to work the fertile farm land around the orphanage. A well-traveled road running by the school afforded them the ability to buy most of the goods needed for the orphanage.
As of 1908 there were 40 children at the farm who are entirely dependent upon the institution for a home. Four of these children were entirely without allotments, having been overlooked and left off the rolls. Twenty more children were living at the home during the school year. These were not entirely dependent but the home affords them far better opportunity than could their relatives at their homes. In 1908, 60 applications for admission to the home during the school year were refused on account of lack of facilities. In 1907, 100 applications were similarly refused.
It soon became apparent that considerable more support would be needed if the Orphanage was to meet the needs of the Indian children. With this need in mind, Rev. Murrow arranged for the American Baptist Home Mission Society to assume full responsibility for the Home and the home was moved to the campus of Bacone College in Muskogee. Substantial fireproof buildings were erected, and the children were cared for in these dormitory style buildings until the move into brick cottages in 1956.
This institution still functions at the same property on Bacone College campus as a non-for profit orphanage for Native American children. Murrow Indian Children’s Home currently provides a home for 20-30 Native American children. These are children that are in State or Tribal Custody and in the current foster care and adoption system. The Cherokee Nation annually donates $5,000 and monetary donations are received from the Muscogee Creek and Sac & Fox Nations. The main fundraising event held for the home is an annual powwow held on the campus of the nearby Bacone College.",,"Atoka, OK / Muskogee, OK",,,,,,,,1
Oklahoma,Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Arapaho_Manual_Labor_and_Boarding_School,,,1867,Closed,Single Building,,Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School,"The first school was opened at the Darlington Agency on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation in 1871 by the Hicksite (Liberal) Friends and Orthodox Quakers and was called the Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School. In 1872, the facility was built with federal funds,[9] but run by the Quakers. Few Cheyenne children attended the school. In an effort to attract them, the Quakers erected partitions to divide the classroom into separate areas for the Arapaho and Cheyenne students.
In 1879 the facility was renamed as the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School. A new facility was built at Caddo Springs for the Cheyenne students; it was called the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School . The Indian Service began its policy of forced assimilation through manual arts training and religious education (the ""Pratt system""), and within 5 years, the agency schools reported that the student children were raising 211 cattle and hogs and cultivating 130 acres of land.
In 1875 John Homer Seger was appointed Superintendent. Seger was very successful in helping the students build up a herd of cattle to supplement meager institutional income. He remained with the schools until May 1882.
In 1908 both the Arapaho and Cheyenne boarding schools were closed, and the government sold these facilities.[14] The Darlington Agency was also closed and was relocated to the new Concho Indian Boarding School in 1909.",,,,,1879,1908,,,,1
Oklahoma,Asbury Manual Labor School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Asbury_Manual_Labor_School,1848,1848.0,1849,,Cottage Plan,,,"Opened as a mission school by the Presbyterian church in 1849 in the Creek town of North Fork Town, Oklahoma. The site chosen in 1848 for the school was an 80-acre farm at North Fork Town, near what is now Eufaula, OK. About 30 acres was fenced. Included on the property was a 20 square foot house with porch and kitchen, a stable, chicken house and a few fruit trees. The site and these improvements cost $300.
The first classes were held in the log house on August 8, 1848, with the Reverend W. S. Cobb as teacher in the log house that already existed on the property. The classes continued in the log house until the new buildings were ready to use in 1850. A stone and brick building 110 feet long, 34 feet wide and three stories high was built with materials shipped by boat from Louisville, via the Arkansas River, then overland to the site by ox-drawn wagons. The U.S. Government paid $5,000 from the funds appropriated for the Creeks under a treaty in 1845, and the balance of the total cost of $9,169 was paid by the Board of Missions of the M. E. Church, South.
The building contained 21 rooms, large halls and would accommodate 100 students and the faculty. In 1848 the annual report to the IMC records that there were 30 Creek students, one local preacher, 24 white teachers and staff and a small balance of $6.75 on hand. The school continued to be maintained by the Creek’s appropriated funds.
The Civil War and Reconstruction was devastating to Indian Territory. Rev. Thomas Bertholf was appointed Superintendent of Asbury school that had been destroyed in the war. Through Creek Chief, Samuel Checote, he secured an appropriation of $6,000 from the U.S. government for the task of rebuilding and reopening the school. Bertholf did not live long enough to accomplish the task. John Harell was then appointed superintendent of the Mission. In 1868 the main building was destroyed by fire. Using his considerable influence with the Creeks and government officials, Rev. Harrell had new buildings built and the school reopened in 1870.
The school burned in 1881 and again for the final time in 1887, never to reopen. Rev. Thomas Bertholf, and Rev. John Harrell, both of whom died during their administrations, were buried on the school grounds. When the present day Lake Eufaula was built the cemetery was relocated to Eufaula’s Greenwood Cemetery and the old school site and cemetery disappeared under the waters of the new lake.
The town became mostly abandoned when a railroad line was built just northwest of there in 1873, and by 1893 the post office for the area was closed in favor of opening one in the town of Eufala which was forming along the railroad.",1887,"North Fork Town, OK (near Eufala)",,,1849,1887,,,100,0
Oklahoma,Armstrong Academy of Bryan County,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Armstrong_Academy_of_Bryan_County,,,1844,Demolished,Single Building,,,"Armstrong Academy was founded as a school for Choctaw boys in 1844. The school was named for Captain William Armstrong, a popular US agent to the Choctaws. “The institution is located two miles south of the road leading from Fort Towson to Fort Washita, fifty-five miles west of the former and thirty east of the latter. It is near the dividing ridge of the waters of Boggy and Blue Rivers, and twenty miles northwest of the nearest point of Red River.” In modern terms the academy was located about one mile east and two miles north from the town of Bokchito in Bryan County, Oklahoma. Funding for the school was provided by the Choctaw national treasury and The American Indian Mission Association (a Baptist organization) which agreed to donate $1000 yearly.
The first classroom buildings and dormitories were built of logs from the area. Classes began on December 1, 1845 with 33 boys in attendance. The first superintendent was Ramsey D. Potts, who had been part of the selection committee for the site. He had been in the Choctaw Nation since 1835 as a Baptist missionary in charge of a mission station and therefore believed the school should be conducted on religious principles. In 1846 the American Indian Mission Association sent Rev P.P. Brown to fill the position as teacher. The school also hired a farmer. Potts noted in 1845 that his students knew almost no English but bragged that by 1847 all of their conversation at school or at home was held in English. (It is well known that many boarding schools forbid the students' native language - with stories about punishment for not speaking English ranging from mouths washed out with soap to lashings.)
The students had a regular routine to follow each day. The Reverend P. P. Brown wrote a letter in which he described how a day went for the fifty-five boys in attendance: During the fall and winter, the first bell rang at 4 o’clock, A.M. for the boys to rise, whose duty was to build fires and sweep out the sitting room. At 5 o’clock all rose, and fifteen minutes after the roll was called. Breakfast took place at 6, after which the boys went to work. At 8 o’clock the bell called the boys together to wash themselves and prepare for school, which convened at half past 8. At 11, fifteen minutes recess was given for rest and recreation. From 12 to 1 an intermission took place for dinner. At 3 o’clock another recess of fifteen minutes occurred, the same as in the morning. At 4 school closed, and the boys went to work until supper, which generally took place a little before sunset. After supper the boys assembled in the school room to prepare the morning lessons.”
By 1855 a letter was sent stating Academy was in need of repairs - the fences were falling and unable to contain the cattle, and that the classrooms, dormitory and teachers houses were dilapidated. The school was closed in the winter of 1954 to make repairs. However, it must not have been enough because in 1857 the Choctaw Council appointed $8121 for the construction of a stone building to replace the log schoolhouse. The new schoolhouse opened in 1859 and reportedly cost $10,000 more than was appropriated.
As a school the average attendance was about 65 students, though in 1859 it had about 100 students. In 1954, the sponsoring American Indian Mission Association was 2 years behind in their $1000/yearly donation. Rev Potts retired in 1954 and a line of superintendents followed: A.S. Dennison only stayed a few months due to an illness, Andrew G Moffat who was a teacher at the Academy became superintendent in 1854, and in 1855 Allen Wright was superintendent until William R Baker was appointed on Christmas day 1855.
The Baptist Missionary Society of Louisville, Kentucky directed activities until 1857 when the organization collapsed. The Southern Baptist Convention promised to uphold the $1000/yearly donation but no record exists of this happening. Feb 1, 1857 it was turned over to the Cumberland Presbyterian Board of Foreign and Domestic Missions who directed it until the school closed in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil War.
During the Civil War the academy closed. Part of the building was used as a Confederate Hospital. Reportedly the Academy was a principle hospital camp for Confederates in Indian Territory, and wounded and sick were carried there from locations as far as Fort Smith. 250 of the dead soldiers were buried in shallow graves in a neglected cemetery that existed nearby at the time. 
The campus served as state capitol for 20 years, beginning in 1863. The Choctaw Council met there in 1863, & The United Nations of Indian Territory delegates (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek, Choctaw, Seminole, and Caddo) met here with the Confederacy to plan war strategy.
In 1884 the buildings served as a Choctaw orphanage for boys aged 6-12. Although only accepting Choctaw orphans, the Academy still operated as a source of English/Americanised education for the boys. The Foreign Missions Committee of the Presbyterian Church send William James Beard Lloyd to be superintendent, who was to teach the boys how to far ""as civilised people farm"". Two teachers were also appointed. In late 1889, the Council called for Lloyds resignation for reasons unknown. Reportedly, there was mismanaged funds at the school during Lloyds supervision that may have influenced the Council in their decision, as well as a desire to see native Choctaw in the position. However, the Foreign Missions Committee of the Presbyterian Church did not approve of the Council's chosen successor to Lloyd and asked him return. (Most likely because their candidate was not a Presbyterian minister, or white.) Lloyd refused.
In 1890, Rev Calvin J Ralston was appointed to replace LLoyd. That same year the school boasted a 130 acre farm however crops for the 1890 school year were a total failure because the fences around the land was in such bad shape that cattle were able to come in and trample the crops. The farm at this time had 200 head of cattle, 130 hogs, and many mules and horses. During this period, not all boys were attending the school by choice. Some were brought to the school by law enforcement officials, and some boys ran away. 1889 attendance records reflect a loss of 4 runaways - while 2 returned another ran away soon after. Regulations were made that any student who ran away and was found would be escorted back to the school by law enforcement.
Whether operating as a school or an orphanage, the school was operated by the Presbyterian church until the Tribe operations in 1890. When the ten-year contract with the Presbyterians ended the Choctaws decided to discontinue management of their boarding schools by religious organizations and the Choctaw Board of Education was formed. The Board appointed Thomas W Hunter, whose father was full-blooded Choctaw, as superintendent. This year, the Board had more applications by Choctaw boys to attend the Academy than they could accommodate. The Choctaw Council passed a law in November 1890 for the purpose of repairing and enlarging the building so that it could accommodate one hundred boys, so it was not long after the 1890 law was passed that it could house more boys.
With the passage of the Curtis Act passed by US Congress, dissolved tribal governments, abolished tribal courts and made all laws of the nations invalid. The secretary of interior gained control over the schools of the tribes. After this takeover, John D Benedict was appointed superintendent and the Academy became much more strict. Benedict was from Illinois and had never taught native students. Benedict appointed Samuel L Morley as head teacher, a man who had taught military tactics at University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He taught the boys military drills and the students faced stern corporal punishment for the infraction of any rule. Morley's military training was spread to ALL of the Choctaw male academies by 1906.
The Armstrong Academy was destroyed by fire in February 1921. The Federal government refused to rebuild it, and today the area has reverted to its original state as a deserted pasture. Nothing remains of the town but rubble from the Armstrong Academy and the cemetery attached.",,"near Doaksville, OK in Pushmathaha District of Choctaw Nation",,,1845,1921,,,,1
Oklahoma,Bloomfield Academy/Carter Seminary,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bloomfield_Academy/Carter_Seminary,,,1852,Active,Institution Plan,,,"In the fall of 1847, the Missouri Conference appointed Rev, Carr to superintend the construction of Bloomfield Academy in the Choctaw Nation. The Choctaw Nation and later the Chickasaw Nation contributed two-thirds of the annual operating expenses, while the Methodist Board contributed one-third. Expenditures were held down because Rev. Carr, a skilled woodworker, performed all of the carpentry and cabinet work himself. In addition, the girls also helped raise corn, wheat and potatoes on the Academy property. They added two orchards producing peaches, plums and apples.
Prior to the Civil War, Bloomfield's curriculum consisted of basic academics, domestic and religious topics. Domestic classes covered sewing, cooking and housework. Religious instruction mainly involved memorizing Christian scriptures, which the missionaries wanted to replace Chickasaw traditions. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Bloomfield and all other boarding schools in Indian Territory closed.
When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Bloomfield and all other boarding schools in Indian Territory closed. The Carrs continued to live at the site, but Angelina Carr died there in September, 1864. During the war, the facility was used as a free private school. Initially, the Chickasaw Battalion planned to occupy it, but there was not enough space for all the soldiers, so the Carr family was allowed to remain. The soldiers camped outdoors and used a small building in the yard for a doctor's office. They also used the sitting room for stores and the school house as a hospital. The Carrs left Bloomfield in December 1867.
The Chickasaw government reopened Bloomfield Academy as a coeducational school in the same year. Captain Frederic Young was put in charge for the first year. Dr. and Mrs. H. F. Murray succeeded Captain Young as superintendent for two years. Professor Robert Cole then led the school from 1870 to 1875.
In 1876, the Chickasaw legislature provided for the Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy, a school for Chickasaw boys. Bloomfield Academy once again became a school for girls only. Professor J. E. Wharton was superintendent from 1876 to 1880. He was followed by Robert Boyd, who resigned in 1882.  Professor Elihu B. Hinshaw succeeded Boyd and served until 1906. Hinshaw is credited with obtaining a charter from the Chickasaw Legislature that allowed Bloomfield to confer diplomas on students who completed the school's curriculum.  Annie Ream Addington remained in charge until 1914, when the main building burned down. Instead of rebuilding, Bloomfield Academy relocated to Ardmore, Oklahoma.
After relocating to Ardmore, Bloomfield resumed operations. In 1934, it was renamed as Carter Seminary. The new name honored Charles D. Carter. In 1949, Carter Seminary became co-educational and boarded Native American children from all over the United States.[5] In 2002, plans were made to relocate the Seminary to 160 acres of land on Lake Texoma, near Kingston, Oklahoma creating a Chickasaw Children's Village.[6] The new facility opened in 2004 and continues to operate until the present.",,"3 miles SE of Achille, OK",,,1847,,,,,1

Construction began in 1854 to establish the school and went on for 3 years. Opened as ""Burney Institute"" for Chickasaw girls in 1859, under supervision of Cumberland Presbyterian Church, Rev. Robert S. Bell and wife, teachers. There was a capacity for 60 students. The boys were taught agriculture and horticulture, and the girls were taught housework, cooking, washing, ironing, plain and fancy sewing, quilting and knitting. All the students were given instruction in all branches of finished English education. The first post office, Burney Academy, was established on July 3, 1860, with Robert S. Bell serving as postmaster and remained open throughout the Civil War.
The home was discontinued during the years of the Civil War and reconstruction, but was re-opened about 1872 serving both boys and girl students. After the Civil War, Burney Institute became known as the Lebanon Orphan Institute.
Name changed to Chickasaw Orphan and Manual Labor School, 1887. The school taught boys agriculture and girls homemaking, but English and literature remained extremely important.
The brick school building was erected at the Chickasaw Orphan Home in 1896. It was a brick, three-story dormitory style structure. The second story reportedly had 18 bedrooms with 18 fireplaces. This building currently still stands but has been reduced to one floor.
Burney Institute finally closed in 1910.
It appears the site was temporarily lost after 1919, being found again after an investigation conducted by the Director or Indian Work for Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1981. At this time they were able to locate the original property, the dormitory building, and the old school building. All were privately owned - the deeds tracing back to L.E. Wood in 1919. In January 2006, the Chickasaw Tribe announced acquisition of the two-story brick school, the first floor of the dormitory building (the only part remaining), amd its surrounding 176 acres.

Situated on a 160-acre plot, a stone school house was erected costing $2,000 and the first crops of pumpkins and millet were planted. 30 children attended school, had their meals, and slept in the small 2 story school house. The second floor of the building was split into 2 dormitory rooms, while the basement contained the kitchen and dining rooms.
Soon the mission would add a stone water tower connected to a well, as well as a laundry facility, pump house, a dormitory, barn, farmers home, and missionary home. They also added a small hospital to the grounds in 1902; being so far from the nearest town and a smallpox outbreak on the loose at the time. The hospital was constructed of stone and in the shape of a Greek cross.
The mission school continued to give Indian youth a religious education until 1918 when Native Americans were granted permission to attend public schools. WW Carithers continued operating the mission until 1923 when he stepped down due to his declining health. Carithers would be succeeded by a number of Presbyterian reverends and celebrated it's 50th anniversary in 1939.
By 1960, the mission had purchased an additional 240-acres surrounding the mission and was still providing church services to the community - however membership declined throughout the 1960's. The buildings on the property began to be sold off or torn down. The stone girls' dormitory and half the school house were sold and materials used to construct a garage nearby. In 1970, Cache Creek Indian Mission officially disbanded due to lack of membership.

Oklahoma,Chickasaw Male Academy/Harley Institute,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chickasaw_Male_Academy/Harley_Institute,1844,1844.0,1845,Active,Cottage Plan,,McKendree Acadeny | Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy | Chickasaw Male Academy | Harley Institute,"Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy was established in 1844 by tribal law as the first tribally established school in the Chickasaw Nation, (the Nation having split from other tribes in 1849.) Although the school was officially established by the Chickasaw Tribe, it was overseen by the Methodist Church with the help up tribal funds. The Chickasaws used a large part of their Mississippi land sale money to establish a school system in their district, and Methodist & Presbyterian missionaries already in the area were ready to serve as teachers. 
The tribe had raised $12,000 in 1844 for the cause, and constructed an academy 2 miles SE of present day Tishomingo. (The area previously was called Good Springs.) Wesley Browning, a prominent Methodist missionary, supervised construction and John. C. Robinson, another missionary & teacher, served as superintendent for several years. This coeducational school with facilities for 120 students was called McKendree Academy.
In 1852 the school began enrolling male students only, after the opening of a girls Chickasaw Academy, and was renamed the Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy for Boys.
After the Civil War the name of the school was again changed, this time to the Harley Institute. (Still boys only school.) In 1868 Joshua Harley and his wife Lucretia, came to the Nation and went into contract with the Chickasaw Nation as head of the school. They both served as teachers at the institute. During these years Mrs. Harley bore four children, two of whom died in infancy to be buried in the cemetery adjacent to the old Academy.
It was reopened by the tribe without Methodist support in 1876. This period of tribal control of their schools is called the Golden Age of the Chickasaw. During this time Chickasaw leaders changed the curriculum at the schools; time spent on religious education was reduced and academic curriculum was expanded. Both Bloomfield (the girls' Academy) and Harley's curriculum was considered equal to that of a junior college.
Between 1880 and 1885, the Chickasaw School suffered several fires and finally tribal authorities decided it would be more expensive to repair the structure than to build a new one. Moreover, the old location had proven unhealthy, some thought due to bad water and waste disposal. Professor Harley died at the school December 24, 1892 and his wife carried on to the end of the school term.  A flood in the early summer (1853) damaged the saw-mill, overflowed the corn field and swept away part of the fence. The water rose in a few hours to many feet higher than had been ever known and the loss to the school amounted to $2,000. About 170,000 bricks had been burned (fired) for additional buildings at the academy. One such building was to be a three-story structure, 52 feet long by 22 feet wide.

Oklahoma,Chickasaw Orphan Home and Manual Labor School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chickasaw_Orphan_Home_and_Manual_Labor_School,,,1844,Closed,Single Building,,Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy for boys | Russell Industrial School | Bloomfield Academy | Wapanucka Institute | Collins Institute | Burney Institute,"The Chickasaws determinedly rebuilt their nation in Indian Territory. Knowing that education was crucial to their ultimate survival, in their first written laws in 1844 they founded a tribal academy, the Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy for boys. They soon opened four other boarding schools, for both males and females. Those schools were the Wapanucka Institute for girls (1852), the Bloomfield Academy for girls (1852), the Collins Institute (Colbert, 1854), and the Burney Institute for girls (1859). Remarkably, those schools were established by the Chickasaw Nation twenty years before the opening of the first federally operated off-reservation boarding school.
The Chickasaws partnered with Protestant denominations in their endeavors. Although the tribe supplied most of the funds, the missionary board controlled the schools' operation and hired the teachers from New England colleges and academies. The curriculum at the best-known Chickasaw boarding school, Bloomfield Academy, had academic, social, domestic, and religious components. Basic academic education was offered, as well as instruction in ""social graces"" such as drawing, painting, and vocal music. The domestic curriculum included instruction in sewing, cooking, and housework, which were considered an important part of the acculturation or ""civilization"" process. Missionaries emphasized the religious curriculum, consisting primarily of scripture memorization, as they strove to replace Chickasaw traditions with Christian teachings. The students were not allowed to speak the Chickasaw language at school, and in the case of many mixed-blood families, at home. Because of the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 the boarding schools were closed.
After the war the Chickasaws reopened them in 1876 and maintained complete control until Oklahoma statehood in 1907. That period was regarded as the golden age of the Chickasaw boarding schools. During those years Chickasaw leaders changed the institutions' curricula. At Bloomfield, for example, religious training was minimal. Bloomfield's academic curriculum was considered equivalent to that of a junior college. In addition, students were instructed in social courses such as art, music, elocution, theater, and dancing. Domestic education was notably absent. Bloomfield enjoyed such a good reputation that the school was termed ""the Bryn Mawr of the West."" Bloomfield graduates were known as ""the Bloomfield Blossoms."" The course of study was designed to educate students to become leaders, to participate in both Indian and white communities, and to help Chickasaws transcend significant social and economic boundaries.
The U.S. government took control of the schools with the passage of the Curtis Act in 1898. At the turn of the century the Chickasaw Nation operated thirteen day schools, four academies, and an orphans' home. By Oklahoma statehood in 1907 the government had laid the groundwork for a state educational system by using the schools of the Five Civilized Tribes as models. Government officials shut down the Chickasaws' school system. Only Bloomfield Academy, the pride of the Chickasaws, remained in operation until 1949, but out of their control.",1949,,,,,,,,,1
Oklahoma,Cantonment Indian Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cantonment_Indian_Boarding_School,,,1888,,Single Building,,New Cantonment Indian Boarding School,"The boarding school began in an US army post located on the North Canadian River five miles northwest of present Canton, in Blaine County, OK. (""Cantonment"" is a general term used to identify temporary military fortifications.) Once it was decided the Northern Cheyenne would be removed from Indian Territory, Cantonment was no longer needed by the army, and the military abandoned it in June 1882. The Department of the Interior gained control of Cantonment in 1882 and allowed the Mennonites to operate the station as a school for Indian children. The Interior Department maintained a school at Cantonment beginning in 1898 and in 1903 designated the facility a subagency of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Agency at Darlington.
A newer campus was built by the Mennonite Church during 1888 (when a new building was constructed after complaints by the Cheyenne) upon 3,800 acres of land in rural Oklahoma, this land belonging to the Cheyenne & Arapaho Tribes was reduced to 800 acres by the U.S. Government by 1913. Rev. D. B. Herschler was Superintendent in 1888.
Schooling was conducted 10 months out of the year, with an attendance of 61 pupils on record in March of 1888. Great emphasis was paid to teaching the Christian faith, as well as ""labor with their hands"". Children taught not to hunt or gather, but rather to garden, farm, and take care of stock. Girls were taught kitchen work and sewing instead of weaving. Native languages were banned from use, making English the only acceptable language.
Consumption (or Tuberculosis) seems to also have been a problem at this particular boarding school, with confirmed reports of multiple children dying from the disease on several occasions.
The town of Cantonment was flooded by the State of Oklahoma in 1938 to create a man-made lake, Lake Canton at the cost of $11 million.
Also known as ""New Cantonment"" and ""Cantonment on the North Fork of the Canadian River,"" the site is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR 70000527), and has been restored by the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes was a reminder.",1927,West shore of Canton Lake,,,1888,1938,,61,,0

Oklahoma,Cherokee Female & Male Seminary Schools,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cherokee_Female_%26_Male_Seminary_Schools,,,1851,Closed,Single Building,,,"The Cherokee Male and Female Seminaries were boarding schools opened by the tribal government in 1851. The male school stood southwest of Tahlequah, and its female counterpart north of Park Hill. In identical, three-story, brick structures, the Cherokee Nation offered students a high school education. The preparatory curriculum of the Male Seminary included Greek, Latin, German, and French; chemistry, botany, geology, astronomy, and zoology; geography, U.S. and English history, political economy, and philosophy. While not as rigorous, the Female Seminary's curriculum was academically challenging. Ironically, neither seminary offered instruction in Cherokee language, history, and culture. The year before the schools opened, Cherokee representatives visited New England, seeking teachers. The men and women they employed from Yale, Mount Holyoke, and Newton Theological Seminary became the first of many Eastern-educated teachers who traveled to Indian Territory to teach in the two schools.
Prospective students first must pass a two-day examination, and the successful were educated at tribal expense. Although most students came from affluent, mixed-blood homes, the attrition rate was high in the early years. Twenty-six women and thirteen men were graduated from the seminaries by 1856. By that year the Cherokees had encountered economic problems. Neither seminary accepted students for the 1856 fall semester. The Civil War dashed the tribe's plans to reopen the seminaries. Used as warehouses, hospitals, and even stables, the buildings were in shambles when the war ended. A destitute Cherokee Nation could not reopen its schools until the 1870s. By mid-decade improving financial conditions enabled the Cherokees to renovate both facilities and hire additional teachers.
Because tribal resources were limited, students paid for room and board when the seminaries reopened. Children of tribe members unable to pay could enroll in an indigent department. To attract more students, the seminaries admitted children from other tribes; admission requirements were reduced, and the national council created a primary department composed of grades one through five and a preparatory department encompassing grades six through eight. Oklahoma historian Grant Foreman claimed that ""the Cherokee Nation had a better common school system than either Arkansas or Missouri."" Both institutions attracted dedicated teachers, but Miss A. Florence Wilson, hired as principal teacher in 1875, made a lasting impression in her quarter-century of service. Administering daily doses of sulphur and molasses and presiding over rigorous walks, she enforced discipline with an iron hand.
The educational routine at the Female Seminary was shattered on Easter Sunday in 1887 when fire demolished the building, but Miss Wilson got all the girls out. Two years later the school reopened just north of Tahlequah. Although both schools offered education rarely equaled in the surrounding states, in the years before Oklahoma 1907 statehood federal officials began systematically reducing the authority of tribal government, including its administration of education. Two years after statehood Oklahoma bought the Female Seminary for forty thousand dollars to house a state teacher-training school. The next year the Male Seminary, which was being operated by the tribe as a coeducational facility, burned. Commencement exercises held at Northeastern Normal School in the spring of 1910 honored the last students to earn degrees at the Cherokee National Seminaries.",1910,,,,1851,1910,,,,1

Rev. John Newton Hamill, Methodist minister, was Superintendent 1858-1860.
Perryville became a strategic outpost in Indian Territory for both sides during the Civil War, and the town saw the Battle of Honey Springs on July 17, 1863 (Civil War). The town was evacuated during the Battle, and some buildings were demolished by artillery fire. Colbert Institute had been entirely burned during the Battle, having been used as a military camp, and was unfit for school purposes.

Collins Institute was established largely through the efforts of Rev H Colbert, and Judson Collins, both of whom were prominent members of the Chickasaw Legislature, with the sanction of Governor. The building used as the Superintendent's cottage and the music building, plus 100 acres of land were bought from B Frank Byrd (a prominent Chickasaw and Treasurer of the Nation). During these first 3 years the school was known as a Manual Training School for Chickasaw Boys and maintained 50% by Southern Methodist church and 50% by the Chickasaw Legislature. Before the Civil War the school was known as Colbert Institute and burned. After being rebuilt it became known as the Collins Institute.
At the close of Methodist occupation in 1890, the Institute was taken over fully by the Chickasaw and a boarding school for girls was established. It remained under the Chickasaws until statehood in 1906. During this period Mr A R Waite was named superintendent and the dormitory attendance increased to 45 pupils.
The school offered a girls and a boys basketball team, industrial department, home economics, English, arithmetic, history, botany, music, drawing, Latin, zoology, agriculture, geography, manners, civics. The school taught 1st through 12th grades.
After statehood the school became under Federal control and continued operations as a girls only boarding school for Chickasaw children.
By October 1906 the Federal government had taken full control of the Collins Institute, teaching grades 1st through 12th for Chickasaw girls only. Students were taught English, Algebra, History, Sewing, Botany, Zoology, and Music among other subjects. Girls also played sports as the school had a basketball team - however they had no transportation for the students and therefore the team never played against any other school despite their hopes.",1917,"Stonewall, Ponotoc County, Oklahoma",,,,,,,,1
Oklahoma,Coweta Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Coweta_Boarding_School,1843,,1843,Closed,Single Building,,Koweta Boarding School |  Koweta Indian School |  Coweta Indian School |  Coweta Mission School |  Koweta Mission School |  Kowetah Mission School,"The mission was started in 1843 by Presbyterian minister Robert Loughridge at Coweta, then the capital of the Creek Nation, Indian Territory. He named the mission ""Koweta"", after the Creek capital. The Creek had originally resisted Protestant religious missions and their related schools. But in 1842, Robert Loughridge, a Presbyterian missionary, had traveled to Coweta to meet with the Creek Council who gave him permission to open a mission because they wanted their children to have access to an education. Loughridge made the school dependant on the mission. The Council forbid the Rev from preaching anywhere except at his mission.
Writing to the US Indian Agent for the Creek, Rev. Loughbridge states, ""My first object was to build a log house to answer the double purpose of school and church. As soon therefore as it was ready for use, my wife commenced teaching a school of fifteen or twenty children, and the neighbors were invited to attendance at the Mission, while the most of them were devotedly attached to their old customs and superstitions."" He also reported that approx 10 of these boys were living at the mission already. The school operated for 3 months before being temporarily shut down due to spreading illness. In two years time, he reported attendance of both the mission school and his religious services had grown noticeably and he was able to form church services.
At some point, additional buildings were added to the mission to include; girls' dormitory, boys' dormitory, dining room/kitchen, and employee cabins. They also added a smoke-house, mill-house, and horse stable. Education at the school was not only religious but also focused on educating boys in ""all manner of outdoor work"" and educating girls on how to ""be good helpmates for the educated Indian man by performing all manner of indoor work"".
Creek officials granted Loughridge permission to build a second school, which he called Tullahassee Mission. Completed in 1859, it was located 16 miles east of Koweta Mission and 10 miles west of Fort Gibson. Another missionary couple, the Rev. and Mrs. William Robertson, operated this boarding school.
The school flourished until July 10, 1861, when it was suddenly broken up, and all the mission property was taken possession of by the chiefs of the nation. The children were sent home, and teachers left for their homes in the North and South. The Coweta school was never renewed; but at the close of the Civil War, the former teacher, Rev. Robertson was sent with others and revived the school to something of its former size and usefulness in March 1868. The school continued in operation until December 19, 1880, when fire from a flue caught the building on fire and it was burned to the ground.
After the American Civil War broke out, the Presbyterians abandoned the Koweta Mission and left the Territory. It was burned during the war. During the war years, most missionaries abandoned the schools and churches they had started among the tribes, but many children had received some education.",,"Coweta, Wagoner County, OK",,,1843,1880,,,,1
Oklahoma,Darlington Mission School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Darlington_Mission_School,1880,,1880,,Cottage Plan,,,"Established as the first Mennonite Mission (partly supported by the Federal Gov) in the country, in 1880. The Mission School was founded by German Mennonite missionary Rev. Samuel S. Haury and his wife Susanna. The school building as completed was a large 2-story wood-frame building painted white.
Rev. Haury gave Sunday services to adults and children alike, but these services eventually turned to be all white gatherings, as Haury only spoke English and found preaching through an interpreter ""does not have a sense for the truth and whose life stands in contradiction with the same, & often does more harm than good."" To illustrate his point with the difficulties of the language, Haury gave an example that appeared in the November 1880 issue of the Nachrichten. ""In order to express the word God, they have the word Tschaba Nihaathu (Tschaba = above; Nihaathu = white man) ""the white man above"". The expression is decidedly wrong, as the Indian sees in the white man only his blackmailer and oppressor.""
The main intent of the missionaries was to work with the Arapaho children and through them bring the adults to Christianity; teachings are recorded as having covered Christian idiology, Biblical history, and Sunday School. English was the only language allowed on campus, braids were cut off, and native garb was not allowed.
Then in February of 1882 on the night of the 19th, a very cold and stormy night, the mission building burned down. Four little children, including the Haurys' 9-month old son, Carl, and three half Indian, half white children (Jenny, Walter, and Emil) that the Haurys had taken into their home, died in the fire. The Haurys lost everything. In a special report published by the Nachrichten aus der Heidenwelt Haury wrote, ""What my heart felt with a look at these 4 little corpses and everything that was connected, I am not able to say. One must be led in such depths of sorrow and pain in order to grasp it.""  After the fire the school continued in tents provided by the commander at Fort Reno and proposed that a new building made from bricks should be constructed.
By December 1882, a new brick Mission had been built, ($5000 of the $7000 appropriated by Congress, the remaining $2000 from Mennonite donations) complete with ""kitchen and dining-room in the basement, a school-room and three private rooms on the first, five rooms on the second floor, and two dormitories in the garret."" At this time they had 25 enrolled students; less than they could potentially hold in the new building. They implemented farming lessons for the boys, and kitchen and household lessons for the girls. Children were taught ""the value of money.""
1883 saw the Haurys move to Cantonment (another Mennonite Mission located close by in present Canton, OK) and Albert E. Funk placed in charge at Darlington. The following year Funk transferred to Cantonment and H. R. Voth became the superintendent at Darlington. V. R. Roth and his wife had come to Darlington in 1882 to begin an evening school for adults. Life at the Mission School at this time was praised far and above over childrens' life at one of the Federal Boarding Schools in the area, like the Cheyenne Indian Boarding School & the Arapaho Indian Boarding School.
The mission work continued on for the next several years as it had in the first five. The quarterly reports indicated much sickness among the Indians, frequent loss of interpreters (usually young people who had gone to Carlisle, the Indian industrial school in Pennsylvania, and, after a brief time back in Indian Territory, returned to camp life and were no longer interested in either interpreting, teaching the language to the missionaries, or further Christianization).
In 1887 Voth wrote ""that with the breaking up of the tribal relation of these Indians a great many of their old customs will be discontinued."" This complaint came in response to a return by the Arapaho to their medicine dances which had been on the increase and drawing more and more Natives in the area. In the winter of 1890-1891, the Ghost Dance movement had spread to the Arapaho in Indian Territory and the result for the Mennonite missionaries was fewer children in attendance at their schools. Whereas the Darlington school had been running at or near capacity with between 45-50 students, in the fall of 1890, there were only thirty-five. Finally in June of 1888 the Mennonite mission had baptized its first convert to Christianity; a young girl, 17 year old Maggie Leonard.
In his 1891 third quarter report, Voth noted that much more effort and money was being placed into the government schools than had been previously. The Arapaho government school was to be improved and a large government school erected within the Seger Colony. Obtaining and keeping students had become increasingly difficult since 1887, and the ""Rules in Regard to Attendance of Indian Youth at School"" passed by Congress in the Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1891 and printed in the 1891 Commissioner's report began to effect the small Darlington School. ""The chief cause of this difficulty seems to be, that the government schools at Darlington have both been greatly enlarged and that the government officials, as is quite natural, endeavor to have these filled with pupils first. The consequence is, that a portion of our former pupils have been persuaded to attend the government school instead of coming back to our mission school."" wrote J. S. Krehbiel, the superintendent.
When in 1892 the number of pupils for the Darlington school was so small that the school didn't open, the Mission Board considered several options, including: a) an orphanage; b) a hospital; c) a home for older Indian boys and girls who have returned from school in order to assist them in establishing themselves in life; d) to take Negro children into the school. The last named plan seemed for a while the most practicable but finally the Government would not consent to the change and so this plan must be abandoned the idea of converting the school building into a hospital for sick and disabled Indians was carried out only in limited fashion to the extent that a room was arranged and furnished and a man appointed to care for sick Indians.
In 1893 the Darlington school opened again but with only 14 students the following year, the numbers were almost double, up to an average attendance of 27 students. But the government continued to decrease the amount of money appropriated for schools under private control. Reports for spring 1894 tell much the same story. Twenty pupils were enrolled, although only fourteen were present. Three of the absent students were ill.
BY 1897 Government monetary and ration support had completely ceased, and the new superintendent Edward H. Haury wrote ""it seems difficult to continue the mission school in Darlington, and considering that the results attained through the school there seem to be out of proportion with the cost and the work required.""
In June 1898 the school at Darlington was closed and never again reopened. In November 1898, A. B. Shelly, editor of the Mission Department of The Mennonite and Secretary of the Mission Board wrote an editorial entitled, Our Indian Mission—Its Present Needs, in which he said:
""Not unfrequently the Missionboard has been hampered in its work on account of an insufficient number of workers. It was on this account mainly that the Board felt itself obliged to discontinue the school at Darlington. And although the Board has decided to retain the station as a mission station, by stationing a missionary there, it has thus far been unable to find the proper person for that position. Should our efforts in this direction prove as unavailing in the future as they have in the past, the Board will no doubt be obliged, against its will, to relinguish this station entirely.""
The Darlington site has had a cherished history since it's closing in 1898. In 1909 it became a Masonic home, of which the 1913 chapel still remains; in 1923 it was taken over by the Oklahoma Narcotics Institution; and the Oklahoma Wildlife Dept. operated it from 1932-1996. It is now the Ag. Ed. and Applied Science building in the Darlington School District in El Reno, Oklahoma.",1898,"Darlington, OK (near present El Reno, OK)",,,1880,1898,,,,1

Oklahoma,Euchee Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Euchee_Boarding_School,1891,1892.0,1894,,,,Yuchi Indian Boarding School,"In 1891, the Presbyterian Mission Board began plans to established a school among the Euchee Indians in this area. Much credit for founding the school is due to Samuel Brown, Noah Gregory, Henry Land, and William Sapulpa. Their work influenced the Creek council to appropriate money for the school from tribal funds. The school was to serve both Euchee and Creek children.
At first the school was in the charge of the Park Hill Prebyterian Mission School, but in 1897 the Creek Nation took over maintaining the school.
Buildings were constructed and the school opened in the fall of 1894 with the capacity for about 80 students. At first the school was coeducational and had only two dormitories and a three-room schoolhouse all located on 40 acres of tribal property about a mile east of Sapulpa. The council appointed a Euchee and Methodist minister, Noah Gregory, as the first superintendent, Henry Land and William Sapulpa served as second and third superintendents respectively.
Agriculture was a part of the curriculum at Euchee, with a huge vegetable garden where the Sapulpa HS football field is now. In later years the boys also took care of rabbits, playing with them on the front lawn until reportedly dogs killed the rabbits over the Christmas holiday.
In 1925 it became a school for boys - 110 Euchees and Creeks and more buildings were added. The girls were sent to Eufaula. The school was improved, enlarged and maintained by appropriations from the Creek council until 1928, when it was taken over and supported entirely by federal appropriations under supervision of the United States Indian Office. In 1929, boys above the 4th grade were transferred to Supulpa City public schools. 
Under federal guidance the school received Creek, Euchee, Cherokee and Seminole boys until 1947. In 1947 the school closed. The land and buildings where sold to school district No. 33 for use by the public schools.
In October 1998, Euchee graduates returned to their old stomping grounds for a reunion and to witness the erection of a new stone marker.

Oklahoma,Fort Coffee Academy,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fort_Coffee_Academy,,,,,,,Fort Coffee Indian School |  Fort Coffee Academy |  New Hope Choctaw Girls Academy |  New Hope Seminary |  New Hope Indian School,"Fort Coffee was built beside the Arkansas River in Le Flore County, Oklahoma in 1834 by the Federal Government at the request of the Choctaw Nation. It is located 6 milesNE of the town of Spiro. The army abandoned Fort Coffee in 1838 when the nearby Fort Smith was reestablished.
In 1843, the Choctaw Nation purchased the Fort properties, and allowed the Methodist Episcopal church to establish the Fort Coffee Choctaw Boys Academy; a religious reform school for Choctaw youth. New Hope Seminary, located just 5 miles away, was established around the same time and served as the girl's academy as a branch of Fort Coffee Academy.
Reverend William H. Goode was appointed superintendent, with Henry C. Benson as the instructor. After they arrived at the old fort location, they spent the night on the lower beach and then set to work the following day. Since the fort had been abandoned for some years, many of the structures were in disrepair. Roofs leaked, doors and windows were broken, and the plaster had started coming out of the log walls. All of the porches and floors had to be replaced.
Once the buildings were repaired, a ten acre farm was cultivated to help feed the missionaries and students. This was worked while Rev. Goode returned to Indianapolis to purchase the rest of the supplies for the academy. By the time it was completed, it served as one of the finest academies in the region.
This school continued until the outbreak of the Civil War, when Confederate forces commanded by General Stand Watie occupied the site. The Union Army recaptured the fort in 1863. Most of the buildings were burned during this time.
Today, the old fort site is on private property, however, there’s not much left to see. Much of Swallow Rock is gone.

Oklahoma,Fort Sill Indian School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fort_Sill_Indian_School,1871,,1871,Closed,,,Josiah Missionary School,"First established as a Quaker boarding school in 1871, the Fort Sill Indian School became a nonsectarian institution in 1891 and remained so until closing in 1980. During its long history the school expanded from one building to thirty. Its enrollment increased from twenty-four in its first year to more than three hundred in the 1970s, and the number of employees on its payroll went from two in 1871 to more than seventy-five a decade later. Because the school was located near Lawton, before World War II Fort Sill's student body was made up largely of Indians from western Oklahoma—Comanche, Apache, Caddo, Kiowa, Delaware, and Wichita. This changed dramatically in the postwar era, however, as Navajo from New Mexico and Arizona began to be admitted. Within a few years they comprised 80 percent of the student population. The influx of out-of-state Native students gradually declined, and by 1970 more than two hundred of the school's three hundred pupils hailed from Oklahoma. Until the 1950s the curriculum for males consisted of vocational and agricultural training, and females received instruction in homemaking. Thereafter, Fort Sill emphasized more of an academic curriculum, although vocational trades remained important.
The original stone school building was located about 1 mile north of the current location, and was 1.5 stories and contained 2 classrooms, a kitchen, dining room, and dormitories. In 1899-1900 the school was moved to it's current location. Rev. Josiah Butler and his wife were relieved of their duties and Julian W Haddon was hired as the new Superintendent. At that time Super. Haddon reported the existance of 12 buildings in ""fair"" repair on the grounds, as well as 160 acres of fertile bottom land and 2,000 acres of grazing pasture under fence. Haddon expressed a determination to focus the school more on agriculture and livestock-raising.
In 1908, the position of Superintendent was abolished in favor of the title ""Principle"" and J.A. Buntin was hired to fill the role.
In 1933 a shop building for vocational classes was constructed as well as a new schoolhouse containing classrooms, followed by a gymnasium in 1935.
In 1955, the position of Superintendent was re-established with James Wallace being promoted to the position.
Students who attended Fort Sill came away from the boarding school with impressions that ranged from downright hatred of the school to enduring fondness for it. For some, the strict discipline and harsh punishment meted out at the institution made it feel more like a prison than a place of learning. Being away from family and tribal communities made the experience even more alienating. Others, however, enjoyed their time there, making lifelong friends, participating in extracurricular activities, and remaining Indian despite attempts by the government's educational machinery to grind it out of them.
Gina Quoetone Pauahty, an alumnus, recalled that the students were punished for speaking their Native languages but often found creative ways to get around this restriction, with varying degrees of success: ""I'm Kiowa, and so to keep from getting into trouble I talk[ed] Comanche. Then I got punished anyway, but I didn't know the difference of why I got punished. I got punished for talking Indian, and I'd talk Comanche before I'd talk Kiowa. All the time I thought if I talk Comanche I'd stay out of trouble."" Hume Fuller, who attended Fort Sill before World War I, found enjoyment on the gridiron despite the brutality of the sport of football: ""Your helmet was . . . thin,"" he explained, ""[j]ust a little old leather deal over our ears so they wouldn't peel your ears off, was all it was."" With determination, strength of character, and often with humor, students made Fort Sill an indigenous institution all their own. This was made clear in the late 1970s when Native students and administrators, alumni, and Indian leaders fought tenaciously to keep the school alive when the BIA announced its imminent closure. Although the coalition kept the school open for several years beyond its originally planned closing date, it could not save it from shutting down permanently in 1980.

Interestingly, Taft had started as the town of Twine, and all black community founded on Creek Nation land allotted to Creek Freedman. The school operated on a Christian basis for the ""expressed purpose of building up pure womanhood and manhood of the negro boy and girls."" The school also taught blacksmithing, wheel-wrighting, sewing and dressmaking at this time.
By 1909 this institute had changed it's name to The Industrial Institute for the Deaf, Blind and Orphans of the Colored Race. In 1912 the ""school"" reportedly had 16 children classified as Deaf, 1 child as Blind, and 72 Orphans. In the same report it is said the Institution sits on 100 acres of agricultural land, and the campus consists of a three story brick building and a one-half story wood frame building. The Superintendent listed in 1912 is Mr. S. Douglas Russel.
Sometime before 1921 the State Training School for Incorrigible Negro Girls was located on the same grounds and administrated by the same Superintendent, with a student population of 7 in 1921. By 1930 the patient population in the school is said to have hit over 300 children.
In 1949 the State Government determined the consolidation of The Institute for Colored Blind, Deaf, and Orphans, The State Hospital for the Negro Insane, and The Training School for Negro Girls; all located neat Taft. (Collectively Taft State Hospital.) They were consolidated into The Negro Institution at Taft. The ""DB&O school"" as it was often referred to - was in continuous operation from 1909-1961.
On January 2, 1989 the Dr. Eddie Warrior Correctional Center opened with 216 female minimum security inmates. The correctional center is still in operation today, using one of the original 1909 buildings from the orphanage. Dr Eddie Warrior (who the prison is named for) had served as business manager of the Deaf, Blind and Orphan Institute before serving on the local school board for many years. The prison is currently operated by the Jacobs Trading Company - a private prison industry company.
There exists a small cemetery for the children lost while living at the Industrial Institute for Deaf, Blind and Oprhans of the Colored Race. It is located in a cattle pasture NW of the original campus site, sectioned off by a small metal fence. The graves do not have markers; no names exist in record to tell us who these children were.

Oklahoma,Hillside Mission School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hillside_Mission_School,,,1886,,,,,"An old one-time palatial structure, built in 1886, that stands on a hillside four miles north of Skiatook, a large addition to this building and a common burial ground in which are buried prominent Cherokees—these are the remnants of a once-flourishing pioneer school where remarkable men and women were educated in the wilds of what is now Tulsa County and what is to-day known by the name of ""Hillside Mission."" Responsible for building this Mission and the efforts of the Friends Society of Philadelphia in establishing a school for the Indians in the then wilderness of the Indian Territory. And during all these years there was one man who had an interest in the Mission and who to-day owns the grounds and the buildings, Mr. Solomon M. Abbott.
Mr. Abbott came to Oklahoma in 1880. He settled on Tyner Creek about five miles north of what later came to be the Mission. He engaged in farming and the cattle business. He loved the woods and the streams, having been reared by a father who had been captured by the Delawares and who was adopted by the tribe and who spent seven years among them. In later life he became an Indian trader. With his carry-all, pulled by four horses, he traded goods to the Indians for furs. He spoke several Indian dialects.
John Murdock was the pioneer founder of Hillside Mission. In 1882, this traveling missionary was sent here by the Friends Association of Philadelphia. 
The region was infested with malaria; and the mosquitoes multiplied so much faster than converts that Murdock found it impractical to carry out his cherished idea of founding a school on the site. He believed that to convert the Indians permanently a school should be established in connection with the Mission. The site was insanitary; but to test it out; he sent to Arkansas and procured a young lady teacher. The enrollment included a dozen greasy urchins. We say ""greasy"" because the children had learned that by mixing certain pigments with coon grease and applying this mixture, mosquitoes would not bother them so much. But not so with the teacher. After heroically battling the singing and stinging insects for two weeks, her face and hands looked as though she had a severe case of measles.
In the meantime, Murdock made a fair showing of converts, mostly children. He made a report and sent it to the association at Philadelphia with a request for funds with which to build a better school building. The funds were promptly sent.
The present site of Hillside Mission was selected for the school. The south side of the Mission was built. A substantial church house was also constructed about eighty feet west of the present house. Malaria and mosquitoes were not so bad on this high location and moreover the mosquitoes could be screened out of the frame building, while they swarmed through the cracks of the log houses. Malaria was checked by the use of quinine, which folks took with as much nonchalance as they did a chew of tobacco.
It was John Murdock who conceived the plan of the school and who had carried it out successfully. After Murdock had built the school, he was ordered west by the Association. He was succeeded by John Watson in 1886. He brought his wife, generally known as ""Aunt Liza,"" and two daughters, the elder, known as Miss Eva, and the other, fresh from college, known as Miss Elma.
Shortly after Watson’s advent into the Mission, he decided to enlarge the dormitory. He hauled lumber from Coffeyville, Kansas, and built the west wing of the dormitory at his own expense. This addition is said to have cost $1200.00. About this time the school room became inadequate for the housing of the pupils; hence, Mr. Watson found it necessary to enlarge it by annexing another building of equal dimension. Thus equipped, every part of the system moved along serenely for three years more. The quarters were, however, too small to accommodate the growing settlement.
About the year 1894, a fund was raised by the eastern committee to erect the north wing, or the last part of the present standing dormitory, which is about 40 by 70 feet and four stories high, counting basement and attic. The attic was finished up in one large room and was used as a gymnasium. This was probably the first gymnasium in Oklahoma. The basement contained two large rooms, one used as a primary department and the other for the boys’ living room, and also as a bath room. The water tank used as a reservoir, together with the bathtub, is preserved intact. Every boy who sat in that living room burned his initials upon the wall with a red hot poker, as there are yards upon yards of initials of all descriptions and kinds on the wall to this day. The ground floor above the basement is divided into four rooms and a hallway. The central room, with the bay window facing the east, was Uncle John Watson’s private room where he prepared his sermons. The first room on the right of the hall at the entrance was a guest chamber. The room at north end of the hall was reception room, and the northeast room was another guest chamber. On the second floor is a hall the entire length of the structure, with sleeping rooms on either side. This was the girls’ sleeping apartment. The west wing before mentioned and built by John Watson, is about 18 by 50 feet, is two stories high with a cellar beneath. The ground floor contains two rooms, the east room for storage quarters and the west one a dining room. On the south side of the dining room there is a long room, about 20 by 60 feet and two stories high. The ground floor was used for all public occasions, for a conference, a festival, or anything of a public nature that required a large room. On the upper floor are sleeping apartments. Then comes the south wing, built by Murdock, two stories high with the upper floor divided into sleeping apartments, and a parlor and private room below. The entire structure contains twenty-four rooms, counting basement and cellar. Quite a good-sized structure for those early days.
By 1929, only the dormitory of the Mission remains intact. The church and other buildings had been knocked down. It was sold by the trustees in Philadelphia to Mr. Solomon M. Abbott, who resides here.
The deed to the four acres that comprise the site of the Mission was executed in Philadelphia. Mr. S. M. Abbott paid $300.00 for the four acres and the pile of buildings in 1929. This land was never allotted, but was transferred direct by the government to the Friends Society at Philadelphia.
Hillside Mission became such a prominent school center because it was the only school in this region. But when the allotment of Indian lands took place the Mission began to lose its position. School sites were purchased in the surrounding villages and in the country, and school houses were erected. Free public schools had come and the Mission, with nearly all patronage gone, dwindled along for a time and then finally died out entirely. But during its time the Mission teachers trained many of the most prominent men of this section of the state. The school was attended by Cherokees, Shawnees and Osages, and many white children also attended here. Board and lodging were $8.00 per month.
In 1885, Hillside cemetery was founded. In this year, a seventeen-year old boy by the name of Jesse Pebbermet, died. Murdock called a meeting of the members to decide on a location for a cemetery. The present site of the cemetery was selected then Jesse Pebbermet was the first of twelve hundred who have been buried there. Among the noted Indians who have been buried at Hillside Mission are Chief W. C. Rogers, last Chief of the Cherokees and Chief George Tyner.
Up to the time of the establishing of Hillside Cemetery, there were no cemeteries in the country. The Indians had their own burial places close to their houses. On the Tom White farm one-half mile north of Skiatook, there is a private cemetery with a dozen graves plowed over each season and no one is the wiser. There are lone graves all over Tulsa County in which sleep men who have been killed in fights or brawls.  Regarding cemeteries, this is what Mr. Abbot commented: ""I know of three abandoned cemeteries in this locality. I have already told you of the Tyner cemetery across the creek from the ""Star House"", my old home. There are only a few headstones left to mark the 20 or 30 graves there, an old barb-wire fence partly encloses it. It was used as a burial ground for the Tyner family. An old abandoned Shawnee cemetery is one mile north of Skiatook on U. S. Highway #1. It lies 1/8 of a mile east in the midst of a corn field; is, in fact, a part of the corn field. The land is owned by T. Furse. As I remember there were about 50 graves there.
On the slope of a hill at the mouth of Panther Hollow is an abandoned Osage cemetery. Follow Highway #11 north from Skiatook for about 9 miles to Bird Creek, from there one-half mile southwest (as the crow flies) is Panther Cave. About 1885 or '86 Antoine Rogers, a prominent Osage Indian, wishing to cultivate the rich bottom land of Bird Creek, had 20 or 30 bodies moved from a lowland graveyard across to the bench of the hill at the mouth of Panther Hollow, near Panther Cave. I used to hunt deer there. Rogers paid an old farmer named Mack Carr $20.00 a piece to move each body, Carr had to make a coffin for each body. The cemetery has been abandoned for the last 20 years. There are more than one hundred graves there. It has been fenced three times but prairie fire always destroys the fence. There are many prominent Osages buried there, among whom are Judge Perrier of the Rock house, John Collins and Scott Antire, prominent cattlemen, inter-married Osages citizens""
In 1937, a field worker, Effie Jackson, visited Sol Abbott at his home.  Here are the comments regarding the mission and the state is was, at the time of her visit:
Surrounded by tall grass and weeds, enclosed by an old barb-wire fence, Hillside Mission is still imposing. Its weather beaten four stories facing the east are in a fair state of preservation, but the old wing on the west is fast falling into decay. The rooms, all empty, except the three in which Mr. Abbott lives are almost ghostly. Creaking floors, torn wall coverings, windowless openings, the home of bats and owls. From Mr. Abbott's description it is easy to imagine just what each room formerly was used for. The ingenious bath room looks almost as if it could be used, so well was it constructed.
Mr. Abbott, a cripple, is barely able to hobble about in the only three habitable rooms. He lives alone, a little kindly man, with a face as fresh as a girl's, manners gracious, a pleasant smile, a ready flow of conversation.",,,,,1886,,,,,1
Oklahoma,Jones Male Academy,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jones_Male_Academy,1891,,1892,Peripheral dormitory school-Choctaw Nation,Wooden,,Jones Male Academy |  Jones Academy |  Jones Academy Indian School,"Jones Academy was founded in 1891 by the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, one of the first tribes to build its own school. The facility was named after Mississippi-born Choctaw Chief Wilson N. Jones. Jones had traveled with his own family over the Trail of Tears and was a strong advocate for his tribe’s people to become educated. The schools first years were presided over by 26 y/o Simon T Dwight, who was a full-blooded Choctaw and prior National Superintendent of Schools under the tribal government. Simons father, Timothy Dwight, had served as Trustee of the old Pushmataha District of schools until his death and had attended mission schools in Mississippi before removal. Simon Dwight passed away in 1894 (28 y/o, cause unknown), but his wife and young son stayed at Jones Academy. His son, Ben, graduated from Jones Academy and was later appointed Chief of the Choctaw Nation in 1930 by President Hoover.
After the death of Simon Dwight, Jane McCurtain (wife of the Choctaw Chief Jackson McCurtain) was appointed superintendent at Jones Academy. Jane quickly discovered financial issues at the academy and soon found they had no money to pay teacher salaries. Coal strikes had dried up the coal royalties that normally fed the Choctaw Treasury. During this time, Jane used her own money to keep the academy open and the students provided for. 
In 1899, Mrs McCurtain was finally reimbursed for the interest required to pay on money she borrowed to keep Jones Academy in working order after she had spent all her cash.
Situated on 540 acres near Hartshorne, in southeastern Oklahoma’s Ouachita Mountain range, Jones Academy began as a school for boys. However, in 1955 when the Wheelock Academy, a Native American girls’ school near Millerton closed, it received approximately 55 girls who were transferred in. Jones Academy then became a co-educational boarding facility.
Students who lived at Jones Academy attended Hartshorne Public Schools as early as 1952 when the Bureau of Indian Affairs ceased funding of academic and vocational activities at most Indian boarding schools. In 1972, the Choctaw Nation became the first Native American tribe to operate a tribally controlled grant school. The Tribe then later contracted the school in 1985 from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This school has been in continuous operation for almost 125 years.",,"near Hartshorne, OK",Dormitory Style // Victorian,,1891,,,,,1
Oklahoma,Kaw Indian Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Kaw_Indian_Boarding_School,,,1880,,[[ ]],,* Kaw Indians Training School |  Washunga Indian School,"In 1873 the Kaw Indians were removed from their reservation near Council Grove, KS and forced by the Federal Government to move to Northern Oklahoma, then Indian Territory. The Kaw Tribe Agency was established in Washunga, OK in that same year. Soon after a boarding school was built and opened on the grounds for the assimilation of Kaw children. The building was a four-story structure made of native stone. Other buildings on the site included a dormitory, infirmary, and superintendents home. The superintendents' home later the Kaw Council House, and in later years the building was moved to higher ground and rebuilt stone by stone. It is now listed on the registry of historic places.
In 1903, the US Government passed the Dawes Act which abolished the Kaw Reservation and others - the tribe lost all protection against white settlers, a battle they had already been losing.
In 1906 the entire original school building burnt to the ground. Newspaper at the time reported all 40 students and all staff escaping unharmed, but also reports that the structure would probably not be rebuilt because the land had already gone through the allotment process. Students were sent to a day-school for the rest of the school year in 1906. The next year, 1907, the Federal Government mandated Kaw children to attend Chillocco Indian School. However the Kaw Tribe pointed out that their contract with the Federal Government afforded them 7 more years of free schooling on their reservation and not elsewhere, so the government was forced to oblige.
In 1964, the Oklahoma Corps of Engineers began the process of preparing the area to be flooded for the construction of Kaw Lake. In 1976, a portion of the already abandoned and them demolished town of Washunga was flooded. Visible now on Google Earth are only slight outlines of some of the streets.

Oklahoma,Wetumka Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Levering_Manual_Labor_School,,,1881,,,,Levering Manual Labor School,"In 1880 the Creek Council appropriated $5,000 for a manual labor school in the nation and Eugene Levering of Balitmore gave an equal amount. (Levering & his brother were wealthy coffee merchants and prominent churchmen of the Southern Baptist Convention. The school was in the southwest part of what was then the Creek Nation, near the north fork of the Canadian River, at the old home of Ward Coachman.
On September 1, 1881, the Levering Manual Labor Mission School, under the auspices of the Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention and partially supported by the Creek Nation, opened to 50 Creek boys and 50 Creek girls.
By 1902 Wetumka public school had an enrollment of 261 and employed three teachers and a principal, Rev. J.A. Trenchard (selected by the Southern Baptists).  land had been cleared for an orchard of 1,000 apple trees and 450 peach trees. The school farm produced 400 bushels of wheat, 250 bushels of oats, 1,000 lbs of beans, 850 lbs of green peas, 30 bushels of onions, 35 bushels of tomatoes, 40 bushels of potatoes, and 60 acres of corn. Girls were issued aprons, calico dresses, linsey dresses, plaid dresses, skirts, shoes and a handkerchief. Boys were issued coats, pants, socks, and shoes. All clothing was donated by the Southern Baptist Council of Women.
In January 1882, Trechard wrote ""Eighty cases of Measles among the pupils has been a serious drawback, but otherwise the school is doing well. Some of the students can not endure restraint, the discipline necessary at school, or their studies, so they run away and generally tell very large tales of 'starvation', 'hard work' and 'hard whippings'. The large majority are contented""
On May 26, 1883 Trechard wrote the Home Mission Board reporting the death of his wife on May 19; the school had owned 175 head of cattle on May 1st but they had disappeared and a member of the Creek Council thought they had been driven to Muskogee to be sold, and some to the Choctaw Nation. ""I fear drunkenness and thievery will nearly ruin us if no check can be put on these vile evils...""
Later in 1883 Trechard writes, ""At Christmas the parents came in and took out most of the children to spend Christmas at home. While at home a rebellion within the Creek Nation broke out, and only about half the students returned to school. After the rebellion was defeated by the Creek Nation, the pupils in attendance are recorded as 96 boys and 77 girls.
In December 1883, Trechman was replaced by Isreal G. Vore. Vore stated the school's need for a hospital, smoke house, milk and fruit houses; which Vore suggested could be of rock as it was cheaper to build with than wood. In 1885 the student population was up to 120 pupils. Dr. J. C. Wingo was sent from Eufala to teach and act as physician for the school. Books for the library were sent from Mission Boards in New York and Pennsylvania. The Creek Nation appropriated $7,000 to finish payment on the hospital.
By 1886 music was being taught, and the school employed many additional workers, such as; a gardener, a laundress, a herder, mechanic, & poultryman. Later that same hear Vore wrote to the trustees that the buildings were badly in need of repaid, particularly the chimneys. The beds were worn out. There were one hundrd students present. In 1886, fifty-six were females and one of them, Emma Bruner, died May 4.  Another loss was the death on October 10, 1887, when Goliah Herod died.
In January 1887, Major Vore died after being Superintendent for 4 years. J. 0. Wright became the new Super. The Woman's Baptist Home Mission Society of Maryland sent a set of wagon maker tools and blacksmithing tools worth $75.00. The school had a fine upright piano in addition to an organ. There was grown on the mission land 2500 bushels of eorn, one hundred tons of millet and prairie hay was put up for the winter. One hundred seventy cattle were owned by the missionaries and they brought fifty-five spring calves. There were eighty hogs, a good span of mules, one pony and a colt.
Because of illness the school closed on June 9, 1890. Dysentery had invaded the mission and Mr. Wright's little son, Bennie, was taken from his loving parents. Next Charlie Scott and Eliza Bruner were ""called to their long home. . . ."" On June 19 Miss Sarah Cundiff, the laundress, also died. Wright's report to Chief Perryman, dated September 1, 1890,to June 30, 1891, gave the number of pupils as one hundred eightgtwo; there had been considerable sickness, some cases serious.
In November 1938 classes were held in churches and the National Guard Armory after a fire destroyed the high school building.
On September 1, 1881, the Levering Manual Labor Mission School, under the auspices of the Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention and partially supported by the Creek Nation, opened in Wetumpka, Oklahoma to provide education for Creek children. It had a start-up cost of around $10,000 and at first had only crude log buildings. The school was gradually upgraded to framed buildings, with a 2-acre campus and additional 80-acres for fields and orchards. 10 acres were cleared for 1000 apple trees, and around 450 peach trees. In 1885 the school built it's only stone building; a hospital with the cost of $1400.
By 1891, grounds had been improved and a white fence separated the girls and boys sides of the campus. (The boys on the South side, the girls on the North.) The pupils were not segregated during classes but were segregated most all other times, including church. One common punishment for girls was to have rags tied to their feet and be made to mop whole floors of the dorms this way.
In an account written in 1887 inside ""The Gospel in All Lands"" produced by the Methodist Episcopal Church, there were approx. 100 boys & girls in attendance, all of whom lived at the school. In addition to the ""English education"" the students received, this book also recounts many girls being trained as teachers and young boys as preachers of the Methodist faith.
In 1883, the minutes of the 16th Annual Session of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, names Major J.G. Vore as Superintendent and claims over 100 Indian pupils.
In 1888, the 20th Annual Report of the Board of Indian Commissions reported Brother James O. Wright as Superintendent; saying the institution was ""never more prosperous"". This document also reports ""more than 150 students"" in attendance.
Buildings in 1891 included the hospital, a 2-story boys dorm, admin building, a doctor's home & office, several smaller girls dorms, commissary, meat house, smoke house, laundry, and ice house. The boys dormitory burned in 1909, no reports of if any deaths were associated with this fire.",,"Wetumpka, Ok",,,1881,1890,,,,0

Oklahoma,Nuyaka School and Orphanage,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Nuyaka_School_and_Orphanage,1882,,,,,,Nuyaka School and Orphange,"The Nuyaka Mission was established in 1882 approximately 15.7 miles west of the intersection of U.S. Route 75 and State Highway 56 (6th Street) in the City of Okmulgee. The mission was established by Alice Mary Robertson and the Creek Council, and run by the Presbyterian Church.
Nuyaka Mission was named for the nearby Creek town of Nuyaka. According to one source, the name Nuyaka is from the Creek pronunciation for New York, which was the site of a meeting between President George Washington and 26 Creek chiefs. Reportedly, the Creeks were so impressed with New York City that they named one of their towns for it. White men wrote the town name as Nuyaka. Ironically, some of the official correspondence cited by Carolyn Thomas Foreman, gives the name as ""New Yorker Mission"" and ""Nuyarker Mission.""
The mission consisted of four buildings. One building contained a chapel/assembly room and some school class rooms. The second building held the superintendent's apartment and housed the boys. The other two buildings were cottages that housed the girls and the teachers who supervised them. Initially, the mission enrolled 70 boys and girls. It had 7 female teachers and one man who supervised the boys after school hours. Rev. Thomas Ward Perryman, a Creek who had been educated at Tullahassee Mission, was the first pastor and taught religious classes.
Per the granite marker at the site: ""Established in 1882 by the Creek Council, Nuyaka Mission was a boarding school for Boys and Girls by the Presbyterians from 1884 to 1899. The Creek Tribe then operated the school for ten years. From 1909 until 1921 it was operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. From 1921 to 1933 it was operated by the Baptists.""
In 1936, the buildings were removed and E.E. Mount bought the site to prevent its destruction. In 1937, his daughter and son-in-law, Oakla and Bill Spears, bought the site and lived in the Dormitory Superintendent's home for 54 years. Interested in the site's history, they interviewed former students and children of former superintendents. Their efforts led to the preservation of the property which they donated to the Oklahoma Historical Society in 1992.",,,,,1882,1936,,,70,0
Oklahoma,Oak Hill Industrial Academy,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Oak_Hill_Industrial_Academy,,,1878,,,,Alice Lee Elliott Memorial Academy,"In 1878, George M. Dallas, a carpenter, was employed by the Choctaw Freedman (African American slaves of the Choctaw given citizenship in 1880) to build a small frame school house on the southwest quarter of section 27. After its completion he taught that year the first term of week day school among the colored people of that section. Others that succeeded Dallas, as teachers in this frame school house, were Mary Rounds, Henry Williams and Lee Bibbs.
In 1884, Henry Williams transferred the day school to the “old log house” on the northeast quarter of section 29, a mile and a half northwest of the school house. The motive for this change was the fact there was no supply of good water near the school house, while at the new location there was a good well and a large vacant building available for use.",,,,,,,,,,1

The Oak Ridge site was approximately three miles southeast of present Holdenville, in the former Creek Nation, where the Seminole dwelled until 1856. The Presbyterian Mission Board built and ran the school. Rev. John Lilley and his wife, Mary Anne, were in charge. The Lilleys were assisted by John Bemo, a Seminole. In 1853 they had twenty-six students, nineteen of whom were Seminole. Creek and Cherokee students paid room and board, but Seminole attended for free. The Lilley's children were also enrolled. Oak Ridge closed in 1855 when the Lilleys returned to the East. They returned and reopened Oak Ridge in 1856 and were assisted by Rev. James Ross Ramsey, who later organized the Wewoka Mission, a boarding school for Seminole girls, just north of Wewoka.

Oklahoma,Osage Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Osage_Boarding_School,,,1874,,Cottage Plan,,Osage Indian Government School,"Opened by the Federal Government January 1, 1874 near the Osage Agency Headquarters in Pawhuska, Oklahoma strictly for Osage children. (Indian Territory until 1907) This federal boarding school boasted an impressive, roughly T-shaped structure of local sandstone, standing four stories high from basement laundry to attic. The building was separated by partitions into two sets of classrooms, dining rooms, and dormitories - one for boys and one for girls.
There was an extensive farm on the grounds, with pigs, milking cows, chickens, and a large vegetable garden which were all cared for by the children.
The Osage Boarding School provided an ""experience in household arts and manual training"" as well as training in English only, and basic academic instruction to both male and female students through the eighth grade. In addition to their work in the schoolroom, each child was given work in manual labor. Girls in baking, sewing, and music; boys in farming, animal care, and carpentry.
In January 1906 the capacity at the school was 100 boys, 80 girls, 180 children total; with an enrollment of 147. The school also recorded a hand-full of runaways a month, some being returned to the school shortly after.
By 1911 the school had added a boiler house, an extensive laundromat , and a power house.
The boys and girls of the Osage Boarding School played basketball, baseball, and football. The girls basketball team of the school attended and performed at the World's Fair, playing basketball and also playing classical musical instruments for the crowds.
The Osage Boarding School closed in December 1921 due to declining enrollment--the remaining pupils were transferred to public and private schools.",,"Pawhuska, OK",,,1874,1921,,,147,1

Oklahoma,Park Hill Mission School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Park_Hill_Mission_School,,,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Park Hill Presbyterian School |  Enid State School |  Northern Oklahoma Hospital |  Northern Oklahoma Resource Center,"Samuel Newton and his wife, Mary, were among the earliest missionaries to the Cherokee Indian Territory. They worked at a mission station named Forks of the Illinois, which was established in 1830 on the east side of the Illinois River close to the mouth of the Barren Fork. The spot was so unhealthy that Mary and their small daughter died. In 1837 the mission was moved three miles west to Campbell Springs. Newton named the area Park Hill because it reminded him of the estates of noblemen in England.
Park Hill soon became the site of a thriving mission. Reverend Samuel Austin Worcester, who had been a missionary and printer among the Cherokee in the East, came west to continue his work. He set up the printing press at Union Mission, but its buildings were dilapidated and the location inconvenient to the Cherokee. Worcester chose Park Hill as the permanent site for his mission and construction began in the summer of 1836. He and his family moved there soon afterwards. In June of 1837 he set up the printing press a mile further to the west of Newton’s school in a meadow overlooking the Park Hill valley. That same summer he established a church with nineteen members. Major George Lowrey soon became deacon and retained that post until his death in 1852. By 1838 the mission school had been moved up to the meadow with Samuel Newton as the teacher. Other teachers there in the 1830s were Esther Smith from Harrisburg, New York, and Sarah Ann Palmer.
At the mission printing office Worcester continued the work he had begun in the East, printing literature to educate and Christianize the Cherokee. Elias Boudinot, former editor of the Cherokee Advocate, helped with translating and printing until his death in 1839. Stephen Foreman replaced him as translator. With their help Worcester translated and printed most of the Bible in Cherokee. John F. Wheeler was the first printer, later replaced by John Candy. The press turned out textbooks, the Cherokee Almanac, religious tracts, and volumes of Cherokee hymnals.
A brick church building was completed at the mission by 1854. Cherokee Chief John Ross and merchant and planter, George M. Murrell, donated much of the money to buy the church bell.
The Park Hill Mission and Press came to an end with the Civil War. Reverend Charles Torrey came to help run the mission when Worcester became an invalid after a serious accident. Torrey became supervisor after Worcester’s death in 1859. Shortly before the war began, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions decided to close the mission because of the troubles the impending war was bringing to the region. They also believed the Cherokees were no longer considered a heathen people and thusly did not require the help of missionaries. (Ironic since there continued to be religious mission schools here for the next 100 years.)
Park Hill later became home of the Cherokee Female Seminary. Chief John Ross held ceremonies in 1847 to lay the cornerstones for the male and female seminaries, which would be located in Tahlequah and Park Hill, respectively. Both were opened in 1851. These public educational institutions were considered equivalent of high schools. Teachers were recruited from such places as Mount Holyoke School in Massachusetts and brought to the Cherokee Nation to teach Cherokee children. Daily regimens at the school included studies of Latin, math, science, rhetoric, composition, geography, philosophy, and religion. Church attendance was mandatory.
In 1887 the Female Seminary burned, creating a huge loss for the tribe. After burning the school was moved to Tahlequah which had a better water source. In 1889, a new building was dedicated on the north side of town. The seminary continued as an entity until 1909, when the state purchased the building. Subsequently, it was chosen as the site for the new Northeastern State Normal School, which has now evolved into Northeastern State University. Today, the building, known as Seminary Hall, is an icon of the NSU campus. The first Female Seminary is located at the present site of the Cherokee Heritage Center, where three brick columns salvaged from the building stand to commemorate this prestigious institution.",,"Enid, OK",,"1,444 in 1963",,,,,,1
Oklahoma,Pawnee Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pawnee_Boarding_School,1876,,1876,Active,,,Pawnee Agency | Pawnee Boarding School | Pawnee Indian School,"The policy of the U.S. Government toward the Native Americans was to get them to accept allotment (ownership of tribal land by individual tribesmen) and American style education. Together, these two things were expected to end the tribes' dependence on the American government. Toward that end, the government had built schools on Pawnee land in Nebraska Territory, where most of the tribe lived by the time of the American Civil War. Treaties between the U.S. and the Pawnees had established that the latter would cede their lands in Nebraska to the government and move to an area the government had designated for them in Indian Territory. The removal had been scheduled for 1876. The industrial school in Nebraska Territory operated by the government for the Pawnees closed in September 1875, since holding classes would be impractical during the move.
For various bureaucratic reasons, the planned boarding schools could not be ready as soon as the tribe arrived at their destination. However, it was possible to open two day schools in February 1876. These could provide only an elementary level of education. Government policy makers held that a hierarchical system would produce satisfactory results. Day schools would introduce children to the English language and basic primary education. Those children who made satisfactory progress would move on to boarding schools, Boarding schools would continue the primary subjects, add more advanced topics and focus half of each day on ""industrial education."" Off-reservation schools offered more advanced education and industrial training.
Although planning for the boarding school was well advanced in February 1876, construction funding had not been approved. An 1857 treaty had appropriated ten thousand dollars a year to operate two industrial education (manual labor) schools. The Pawnees had expected to use the unexpended portion of the money to construct the new school. The government's Indian Office held that the funds were only to support existing schools, not to build new ones. By the summer of 1877, the Indian Office finally agreed that not using the funds to build the new school meant that the Pawnees would have no school, therefore abrogating the treaty. The construction contract was awarded shortly after. The new school building and girls' dormitory were completed in May, 1878. However, other delays ensued. A cistern dug near the school leaked all its water. Later, it was determined that the cement used in its construction was still ""green"" (uncured) when water first filled the cistern. This was repaired, but purchasing school supplies was delayed in the Fall by bureaucratic delays getting the required approvals. School finally opened on November 11, 1878.
McClure documents complaints and problems that cropped up after the school opened. One was overcrowding. Agents regularly requested funding for a second school, as promised in the 1857 treaty. No such action was ever taken. In 1884, the Agent reported that the water supply had always been inadequate; water of poor quality had to be hauled from a source a half mile away. Official visitors found 39 girls sharing 13 beds in 1889. The sewage system was inadequate as late as 1900. Despite the lack of a satisfactory sewer system, there was a new building program during the 1890s that resulted in the construction of a commissary and carpenters' shop (1891) and the Boys' Dormitory (1892).
The original Boys' Dormitory was destroyed by a fire in 1904. There were no deaths or injuries, but the monetary loss was estimated at 25 to 30 thousand dollars. The school sent some of the youngest boys back home and housed the remainder in other buildings. The administration also concerned itself about fire safety measures in other buildings. The burned building was replaced in 1909.
In 1932 another large building was constructed to consolidate a number of functions that had previously been scattered in other buildings. It was said to have been completed in September 1933, and contained classrooms, offices, an auditorium and a gymnasium. This was the last building constructed on the school campus, and has several features not found on other buildings, including:
-a T-shaped floor plan, with classrooms and offices in the cross wing and a gymnasium in the column;
-a portico in the center of the cross wing, with three round-arched doorways and, inside the portico, a double-doored entrance framed by a large round-headed arch;
-a date stone above the center of the portico bears the number ""1932"" and the name ""A. R. Snyder"", who was the school superintendent at that time;
decorative arched porticos toward the sides of the front facade, with slightly recessed brick beneath them.
The main part of the building has a flat-top and hipped mansard roof which extends over each end of the front (west) facade, forming a gable over the decorative arch in each end of the facade. Each gable contains a fanlight. There is a flat roof over the portico. The gymnasium has a low-pitch gable roof with no overhang. The roofing material is a light colored metal, and there is a parapet above the ridge. Elsewhere, the roof is covered with modern composition shingles.
This was the main school building until the boarding school ceased to operate in 1958. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) then turned the building over to the city of Pawnee, which made it available for the Good Samaritans, a charitable service organization to turn it into a nursing home. The Samaritans vacated the building in 1972, when the city announced it would return the school property to the Pawnee tribe. The 1932 School Building was renovated in 1976, then leased by the BIA to become the administrative offices for the Pawnee Agency.
In 2011, the Oklahoma Historical Society's Historic Preservation Office awarded its Citation of Merit for the rehabilitation of three buildings of the former boarding school. The buildings were: the former staff quarters, the dining hall and Pawnee Indian Clinic. All three now serve the new Pawnee Nation College. Recipients of the award were the Pawnee Business Council, Barrett L. Williamson Architects, and Builders Unlimited.",1958,"Pawnee, Pawnee Tribal Reserve, OK",,,1878,1958,13,,39,0

Oklahoma,Seneca Indian Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Seneca_Indian_Boarding_School,,,1872,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"The Wyandotte tribe was removed to this area of Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in 1867. The Society of Friends (Quakers) established a mission in Wyandotte in 1869. The Wyandotte Tribal Council donated land for the Quakers to establish a boarding school for Seneca, Eastern Shawnee and Wyandot, Ottawa, Modoc, Eastern Quapaw, United Peoria, and Western Miami children. Construction of the school began in 1871 and classes began in 1872 with fewer than 50 students. Due to increased pressure after the Federal government took over in 1880, the enrollment increased to more than 135 by 1885.
Other names for the school were Wyandotte Mission, Seneca, Shawnee, and Wyandotte Industrial Boarding School, and Seneca Boarding School. It was supported bu the Quaker Friends' Church until 1880 when it became fully supported by the Federal Government. By the 1920s, the composition of the student body had changed, and was largely Cherokee students. The school had a capacity of 130 students.
The school offered education to children ages 4 - 18, initially offering curriculum through the fourth grade, later expanding to the ninth grade in the 1920's. Unlike the church-sponsored school that failed, the Seneca Indian School ""thrived"" in turning so-called ""savages"" into students; earning it the nickname ""Marvel of the Wilderness."" The boys worked in carpentry, and farm management and maintenance. The girls were taught English cooking, sewing, home management, and grooming.
After the 1880 government take-over, the school is reported to have had strict military discipline and dress reviews, and forbade the speaking of Native languages. The schools superintendent often reported students not returning after Christmas breaks (the only break of the year, a Christian holiday.)
The school had an outbreak of measles and typhoid in 1927, and ""dozens of children"" died.
In 1928, a new principal was appointed, Joe Kagey. The school changed its admittance policy, and was opened to children of all tribes. It became an ""institutional"" school for children coming from situations of hardship. During this period, the school was known for having a successful athletic program in which their teams ranked among the best in the state in football, basketball, baseball, tennis and track. They held an ""Athletic Field Meet"" which included compitition in all sports. In 1952, there were 173 Cherokee students, and a 100 students from other tibes. Kagey retired in 1956.
The school closed on June 15, 1980. The school's 189 acres of land were returned to the Wyandotte Tribe.

Oklahoma,Chilocco Indian Agricultural School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chilocco_Indian_Agricultural_School,,,1883,Closed,Single Building,,Haworth Institute | Chilocco Indian Industrial School | Chilocco Indian Agricultural School | Chilocco Indian School,"Constructed in 1883 and known by various names (Haworth Institute, Chilocco Indian Industrial School, Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, Chilocco Indian School) this federal off-reservation boarding school was established to house, civilize, Christianize, educate, and transform American Indian youth. Thousands of Native children and young adults passed under the school's entryway arch, the architectural marker of ""civilized"" space since Greek and Roman times. In January 1884 Chilocco opened its doors to 150 children from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Wichita, Comanche, and Pawnee tribes. By 1895 enrollment had increased to 352, and by 1906 students hailed from a wide variety of tribes across Oklahoma and the West. Significant enrollment from the so-called ""Five Civilized Tribes"" did not occur until after 1910, but by 1925 Cherokee constituted the largest single tribal affiliation at the school (26 percent of approximately nine hundred students). As public schools became more accessible to Indian children after World War II, Chilocco served students from more remote, inaccessible areas such as the Navajo reservation in Arizona and New Mexico and communities in Alaska.
Located between Arkansas City, Kansas, to the north and Ponca City, Oklahoma, to the south, Chilocco embodied many roles until its doors were closed in 1980. Home and haven to some, reformatory and prison to others, Chilocco was one of many federal schools designed to dissolve tribal identity and erase indigenous beliefs and practices. Judged by these federal goals, Chilocco both succeeded and failed. In the process, the lives of native people were indelibly altered, and Chilocco alumni, whether they praise or curse its name, will always know themselves as Chiloccoans.
From 1884 until the early 1930s Chilocco operated according to a template devised by U.S. Army officer Richard H. Pratt at Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. The large off-reservation schools used rigorous military discipline and stressed instruction in trades and manual and domestic labor—known as ""actual work."" Alumni from these years remember twenty-two bugle calls a day, government-issue uniforms, scanty meals, inadequate health care, and a paucity of individual attention. They also remember the bonds of loyalty and love that knit students together, and the rivalries of tribe, degree of blood, age, and language difference that cross-cut school society.
In 1928 an exposé of federal Indian Service mismanagement scathingly critiqued conditions in the boarding schools, and in the early 1930s some reforms were introduced. Boys and girls could sit together in the dining rooms, more attention was invested in academic work, and drudgery work devoted to school upkeep was cut back. Nonetheless, many aspects of student life endured: separation from home and family for years at a time, devotion to fellow students, strict discipline, and curricula that remained focused more on vocational than academic preparation.
Through the 1960s and 1970s changing social conditions, growing Native enrollments in public schools, critiques of boarding school conditions, and federal reluctance to fund and operate schools for American Indians (despite treaty and trust obligations) led to the closure of many institutions. Chilocco closed its doors in 1980. At the end of the twentieth century only a few of the flagship off-reservation schools continued to serve Indian youth: Sherman Indian High School in Riverside, California, Chemawa Indian High School in Salem, Oregon, and Chilocco's sister school, Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas, as Haskell Indian Nations University. Since 1989 the Chilocco campus site has been leased to Narconon of Oklahoma, Inc., which operates Chilocco New Life Center, a drug rehabilitation program",,"Wetumpka, Ok",,,1884,1980,,,900,0
Oklahoma,Concho Indian Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Concho_Indian_Boarding_School,1909,,1909,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School at Concho | Concho Demonstration School,"The first school was opened at the Darlington Agency on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation in 1871 by the Hicksite (Liberal) Friends and Orthodox Quakers and was called the Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School. In 1872, the facility was built with federal funds, but run by the Quakers. Few Cheyenne children attended the school and as a means to entice them, a partition was erected to divide the classroom into separate areas for the Arapaho and Cheyenne students. In 1879 the facility was renamed the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and a new facility was built for the Cheyenne students located at Caddo Springs, which was called the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School. Within 5 years, it was reported that the children at the agency schools were responsible for raising 211 cattle and hogs and cultivating 130 acres of land.
In 1881, a new school, called the Darlington Mission School was built and run by the General Conference Mennonites but a fire which occurred on 19 February 1882 destroyed the building, taking the life of the missionary's infant son and three Indian children. Federal funds and donations from the Mennonite Mission Board were secured to rebuild the mission school by December, 1882. The Mennonites had the same problems as the Quakers had had in trying educating the two tribes together, and opened a fourth school in 1882. called Cantonment. By 1884, the agent reported that attendance in the four schools represented 66 students at the Arapaho boarding school, 22 students at Cantonment, 71 students at the Cheyenne boarding school and 28 students at Darlington.
After 1891 federal policy shifted and began to require more standardization, attendance quotas and less use of federal funds for church ""contracted"" institutions.[11] By the mid 1890s only about half of the school-age children on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation were attending school. An experiment with enrolling Indian children in the public school system and offsetting the costs to the schools was attempted in 1896-1897, but was discontinued. Declining attendance at Darlington forced its permanent closure in June, 1898 and Cantonment closed in 1901. In 1908 both the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School were closed and the facilities sold by the government. The Darlington Agency was also closed and relocated to Concho in 1909.
The new school Concho Boarding School opened in 1909[4] and re-implemented the farming model, which continued during the Great Depression. In 1932 the Seger Indian Training School, which had incorporated the students of the Red Moon School in 1917, closed and its students were transferred to Concho. Total Concho Boarding School students for 1932 were 133 boys and 117 girls.However, the school struggled during the Dust Bowl period, where between 1933 and 1937 there were 362 dust storms in the immediate area, coupled with tornadoes and flash flooding. As part of the Works Progress Administration President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an Executive Order in 1933 which authorized the Indian Service to establish a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Concho to improve the grounds and buildings, implement soil erosion controls, and develop water resources. The agency buildings were razed and rebuilt in 1933 and a hospital was constructed in 1941.
The era of the federal Indian Termination Policy from the 1940s through the 1960s saw threats to close tribal schools and Concho was not immune. Richard Boynton and George Levi, of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes Business Committee and Robert Goombi of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma sent pleas to Oklahoma Congressmen to fight school closure. The bid to save the school was successful as some of the buildings were converted into a facility to assist troubled students in 1962. In 1968, a new school complex was built for the boarding school, featuring a pioneering teaching program which was to be operated in conjunction with Southwestern State College. The program was designed to overcome language and cultural barriers and offer Indian students access to college materials and individual instruction.
The school was closed after the graduation ceremonies held 14 May 1982 due to federal budget cuts. Though parents and the tribe protested the closure and obtained an injunction to stop it, at the end of the 1983 school term, the school permanently closed. The school buildings were returned to the tribe from the BIA in 1985 for use as business enterprises. In 2015, plans were in the works to convert some of the buildings to a fitness center.
Concho was developed to provide a means of integrating and assimilating American Indian children into mainstream society. It, like other federal boarding schools, was run on a strict military model. Students were wakened at 5 a.m., performed military drills and formations, ate breakfast and were in class by 6:00 each morning. Academic subjects, including reading, writing, and arithmetic, were studied for half the day and the remainder of the day consisted of labor.
Trades and farming were taught to boys and girls were taught domestic labor and nursing. A large experimental farm was maintained, where the children were instructed in conservation and planting techniques. Boys milked cows and girls helped prepare all of the meals and sewed clothing. Discipline was strict and infractions, like speaking in their native language rather than English, were punished by things like breaking large rocks into smaller rocks or sawing wood. Each infraction required punishment of one hour of labor.
Initially, the school offered education to the 6th grade and students would have to transfer to Carlisle, Chilocco or Haskell Institute for secondary education. By around the 1920s, the school curriculum mirrored public education being offered throughout the country and included sports, music, art, and a full course of educational subjects. By the time the school closed in the early 1980s, it offered instruction for grades one - eight and was predominantly attended by orphans and students who had difficult home environments.",1983,"El Reno, OK",,,1909,1983,,,,1
Oklahoma,Quapaw Industrial Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Quapaw_Industrial_Boarding_School,,,1872,,,,,"The school originally opened in 1872, after Hiram Jones (a white man) had been appointed by the Federal Government as appointed resident agent for the Quapaw Agency.

The buildings included a schoolhouse, a large boys sitting room, boys dormitory, superintendent's quarters, employees building, a bath house, laundry, hen house, commissary, girls building with kitchen & dinging room, tank house, grocery house, little boys room, and a barn.
Built near the center of a 160 acre farm, the school was conducted as an industrial training institution. Along with studying spelling,  arithmetic, reading, writing, geography, United States history, physiology and the other topics. It was a common practice for the boys to aid the school custodians in cultivating the soil, milking the cows, caring for the poultry and hogs, aiding in constructing and repairing buildings and in doing various other things of an industrial nature. On the other hand, the girls joined with the matron, seamstress, and cooks, aiding in the general housework, doing the sewing, laundry, ironing and cooking.
In a 1881 report, the school had 75 Quapaw students enrolled. By 1898, Quapaw was one of two boarding schools belonging to the Five Civilized Tribes to enroll more than 1,000 students.",,,,,1872,1920,,,1000,1

A typical reservation boarding school, it offered Kiowa children a common-school education through the sixth grade based on a curriculum divided between academic instruction and practical skills. For girls, this meant training in domestic arts; for boys, it meant working in the school's various farming and industrial departments. The Kiowa generally supported the school, and by the turn of the twentieth century annual enrollment averaged 130, a number that exceeded the school's capacity.
A very small number of Rainy Mountain students continued to receive education at off-reservation boarding schools such as Carlisle and Phoenix, but for most students, Rainy Mountain was their only formal education. A well-organized petition drive by the Kiowa could not prevent the school's closing in June 1920 after the campus had fallen into disrepair and the government scaled back federal Indian education programs.",1920,"Gotebo, OK",,,1893,1920,,,130,0

Hammon, for whom the surrounding town is named, was  established an Indian School northeast of Hammon, Indian Territory. After the land opening James Hammon had been sent to the Red Moon Agency to build a reservation school and to teach the Cheyenne and Arapaho to farm. The school was named Red Moon School in honor of the Indian Chief. This school was also a mission for the Mennonite faith. The school was a single building, wood-framed structure with no running water and was painted white.
In 1908, after statehood was passed, the school was given agency responsibilities by the Federal Government as a subset of the Cheyenne Arapaho Agency. These duties included taking and keeping records of land allotment, annuity rolls, health records, and census'. But when the school was closed in 1917, those responsibilities transferred back to the Cheyenne Arapaho Agency which today is the Concho Agency.

Organized in 1871 by Quakers at the old Wichita Indian Agency commissary with 8 pupils and Thomas C. Battey as the first principal. A History of Riverside Indian School, Anadarko, Oklahoma, 1871-1971, was written by Ruby W. Shannon, who taught English and journalism at the school from 1964 to 1970. ""Initial classes were held at the agency in the spring of 1871. In the beginning, it was supposed to be a day school, with students who lived nearby going home each night. Still, most of the students came from at least four or five miles away. They often spent the night on campus, sleeping behind a log or fence or anything that could afford a windbreak,” Shannon wrote in her book.
When the school reopened in fall 1871 following a summer break, the agency staff had set up a makeshift dormitory with one room for boys and another for girls. A permanent school facility replaced the makeshift one in 1872 “a short distance” from the agency.
They added the Wichita-Caddo School to the property in 1872 accommodate Washita and Caddo children. In 1878–79 the facility was relocated, due to a massive fire at the original building, one mile west to its present location along the Washita River and was named Riverside Government Indian School.
The Riverside Government Indian School ran off the adage ""Kill the Indian, Save the Man."" The schools main purpose, under Federal rule, was assimilation over education. Pupils had their long hair cut off, cultural clothing taken and replaced with English clothing, and were forbidden to speak any language except English or suffer punishment that could include beatings.
For a half-century Riverside served Wichita, Caddo, and Delaware students, and in 1922 Kiowa enrolled there after Rainy Mountain Mission School closed. Navajos began attending in 1945.
Still in operation and overseen by the Federal Government, Riverside presently has students from dozens of Indian nations attending grades four through twelve. Admission requires a Certified Degree of Indian Blood. Riverside's board of education, administration, staff, and faculty are predominantly American Indian.
Riverside's history is a part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs federal boarding school system that originated with Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Indian boarding school-system curricula generally emphasized agriculture to 1910, vocational education to 1960, academics to 1990, and college preparation in the 1990s. Cultural programming was introduced in the 1960s. Approximately six hundred students were enrolled at Riverside during the early twenty-first century.
A large cemetery is rumored to have been accessible about a 1/2 mile behind the Riverside school until the 1980's. Locals now report that the dirt road leading to it has disappeared with time and the headstones gone.

There they were forced to learn English and were often punished for speaking their active Indian lanuage.
""Many wagon loads of nearly 100 children are expected to attend the Sac and Fox Mission School,"" reported a Stroud newspaper in September of 1901.

The Potawatomi Nation already had several Catholic Missions on their allotted land and were familiar with the religion. On Sunday, May 13, 1877, the first Mass at Sacred Heart was celebrated. Sacred Heart as a township was not permanently occupied until June 7, 1877, which is regarded as the true founding date of the parish.
The Saint Mary's Academy was established in 1880 for the education of girls, along with a boarding school for boys, the Sacred Heart Institute. By 1884, there was a convent ran by the Sisters of Chartity, a school for the girls, stables, employees' houses, blacksmith shop, tool house, carpenter shop, and a bakery-where the Sisters baked 500 French loaves each day. A model farm - with a great variety of orchards, gardens, vineyards, fields, herds of animals and every form of agriculture was developed. The farm had two main purposes: to supply food for the institution and to provide a model for the Indian boys to copy. The mission had its own publication, the Indian Advocate, which was published from 1888 to 1910 in the bakery building. In 1884 the Sacred Heart College was established, offering secondary and tertiary education for boys, followed by boys' elementary education in 1926.
On the night of January 15, 1901, a fire broke out in the dining room of the Indian Boys School and swept out of control. Before it was over the blaze had destroyed the monastery, boys' school, college, girls' school, convent, and the church. Historical news accounts report that no one was killed, but the entire mission was destroyed with the exception of a few small buildings. The bakery and the two-story log cabin are the only buildings that remain today. Temporary wooden buildings were set up to carry on the boys' school, while the Sisters of Mercy moved one-quarter of a mile southeast to create a new St. Mary's Academy. Mass was celebrated in a converted granary. The present church was begun in 1905, but was not completed until 1914.
Upon Rev. Robots death in 1937, Rev. Ignatius Jean who had established other Catholic missions across Indian Territory became head of Sacred Heart Mission School. Rev. Jean rennovated and supplied a teacher for the Chickasaw and Choctaw Freedman on the south side of the Candian River, making a deal with them that they would construct the buildings walls out of local timber themselves.
Sacred Heart reverted to use as a priory after all other functions had moved to St. Gregory's College in Shawnee. The priory closed permanently in 1965. The church remains, but most other buildings have been demolished. The site of the sacred Heart Church remains on the US Register of Historic Places.

John Homer Seger, a white settler in the Indian Territory, founded the school in 1893 on 300-acres of land. Seger had come to the Darlington Agency in 1875 to work as a teacher, and he established the Seger Colony (the predecessor of Colony) in 1886 with 120 Arapaho.
The school taught farming and industrial skills to Native Americans until it closed in 1941; one of the buildings later became Colony's public school. When the school closed in 1941 there were reportedly over 30 structures on the property, and the students were farming approx. 1200 acres of land. The buildings included dormitories for the girls and boys, office buildings for staff, a chapel, barns, and even a small hospital. Most of the buildings included running water, sewage, and electrical lighting. In 1941 at closing the school also reported having sold some 200 head of cattle, many good horses, and 200 head of hogs that had been raised by the students. The last year of operation in 1941 boasted 160 pupils who were afterwards transferred to other Indian schools.
Notably, after the closing of his school Segar took a superintendent position for the Arapaho Boarding School from 1874 until 1879.

Oklahoma,St. Elizabeth's Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Elizabeth%27s_Boarding_School,,,1888,Demolished,,,,"St. Elizabeth's Academy was in Purcell, Oklahoma, about as far north of Pauls Valley as Bloomfield was to the south. Like Bloomfield, it was a school for Indian girls, and while it wasn't as old as Bloomfield, it also had a colorful history. It was founded by the Order of St. Francis, which sent three nuns from Glen Riddle, PA to the Chickasaw Nation in 1888 to establish a school. The church and school buildings were built by Benedictine priests who lived nearby. Purcell's founder, Robert Love, offered a portion of his pasture for the church and school, and a three-story dormitory style building was erected on the site.
The project would have certainly failed had it not been for the efforts of Benedictine priest Vincent Jolly, who taught at the Sacred Heart Academy in Pottawatomie County. He had heard about the work of Sister Katherine Drexel, a nun from a wealthy Philadelphia family who was using her fortune to fund schools in Indian communities. Father Jolly convinced Sister Katherine of the need for schools for the Indians in Oklahoma, and for the next sixty years St. Elizabeth's was supported by Sister Katherine's fortune. 
Sister Katherine was an outspoken religious advocate for oppressed Native Americans and African Americans. She financed more than 60 missions and schools throughout the south and southwest, as well as Xavier University of Louisiana, the only historically black Roman Catholic university in the United States. She also founded a religious order, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, composed mainly of Indian and Negro nuns. In 2000 she was canonized and became the second American born saint.
In 1886 a church, St. Elizabeth Church, was built on the grounds; later becoming Our Lady of Victory Church after the schools closing in 1948. Our Lady of Victory Church still stands and is an active Catholic Church. And in 1887 a day school called St. Scholastica Day School; but this was only open until 1890. 
St. Elizabeth's started as a coeducational school with a carpet used to partition off the one-room church for school, boys on one side and girls on the other. By 1891, over 100 girls and 57 boys were attending St. Elizabeth’s. Ground was broken also in 1891  on the corner of what is now Fourth and Jefferson for the new two-story day school. It was completed in 1892. The school suffered a fire in 1925 in the chemistry lab that destroyed part of the school.
By 1926 it was for girls only. After converting to girls-only, the school offered piano lessons among the classes offered, and the girls were assigned time during each day for practice. Originally, the school went from first through 12th grade, but the last 20 years only first through eighth grade classes were held.
St. Elizabeth’s closed Sept.1, 1948. During it's 60-year lifespan, 24 nuns from the Mother House in Pennsylvania served St. Elizabeth’s. After the convent closed, a two-story section of the building was moved south of the existing church. It was then used as a chapel and piano classroom, along with being a residence for the nuns who remained to staff the day school. The old two-story day school was razed and a new school built in 1959. The day school closed in May 1968 and the building was then used as a parish hall.",1948; however still an active church on site,"Purcell, OK",,,1888,1948,,,,1

The following fall a school building was built.  A subscription fee of $1.50 a month was charged, but that was not enough to pay for the lumber used to build it, so the Chickasha School Company made plans to sell the building in order to pay the debt.
In 1898, the property consisting of a whole block, with a two-story school building was purchased from the Chickasha School Company by Reverend Isidore Ricklin of the Catholic church, O.S.B. of Anadarko, for $1,650. Mother Mary Agnes, who was at the time Superior General of the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, Glen Riddle, Pennsylvania, sent four Sisters to open Saint Joseph School at Chickasha, Indian Territory, on the 25th of August, 1899.  It was the only religious school in Grady County.  St. Joseph School began with an enrollment of 135 students.
Improvements and addition were made through the first years to accommodate the increased number of children in the parish.  When it was realized that the income of the Day School was insufficient to support the school, the Boarding School was initiated to provide more funds.  The classrooms were on the first floor of the two-story building while the Sisters and the few children lived above.  The number of children increased in the parish, therefore, more Sisters were needed.  The Sisters needed more classrooms so they proceeded to build another small building from their funds.  The Knights of Columbus urged the Sisters to enlarge the building, making a contract to occupy a portion of it until it was required for the school.  It wasn’t long until the school required all available space for classrooms.
After twenty years of steady labor and determination, a campaign was started for the purpose of obtaining funds for the erection of a new school.  The growth of the school had been very rapid and the buildings were entirely inadequate to the use of the increasing student body.  The campaign was a success and the rough red brick building which the residents of Chickasha remember as St. Joseph’s Academy was built.  The old white wooden building was moved, from the Northwest corner of 7th Street and Colorado Avenue to the Northeast corner of 8th and Colorado by the contractors, Monnot and Reid, and the building was later dismantled on July 30, 1937.
Saint Joseph's Academy is identified as St. Joseph's Catholic Boarding School on the Census of 1910.  It was actually St. Joseph's Academy, a Catholic School conducted by the Sisters of  Saint Francis.  The census showed only 7 of the 25 boarding students were Indian.  Those Indian students were also listed as residents of the St. Joseph Orphan School.  The other students were found with their parents on the next census.  Frequently, the orphan Indian students moved on to additional educational facilities.  Some were found on the 1920 census in Murray County at the Murray State School of Agriculture in Tishomingo, Oklahoma.
St. Joseph's School, later called St. Joseph's Academy, was run by the Sisters of St. Francis.  This order of religious nuns, in America, originated in 1855 in the city of Philadelphia.  Bishop John W. Neumann enlisted the help of the sisters who had a base community in Ireland.  Pope Pius IX counseled the bishop to found an American Community from within the ranks of his own parish in Pennsylvania.  In reviewing the census records at St. Joseph we can see the prevalent Irish background of the Sisters, and also the Community's ties to the state of Pennsylvania.",,"Chickasha, OK",,,1899,,,,,1

The school cost $1500.00 to build, with a $350.00 Priest's house nearby.
Historians have consistently referred to the Quapaws as a Catholic tribe. As early as 1673, Father Marquette, a Jesuits, had visited the Quapaw.
The Catholic Indian Boarding schools took the Federal Boarding school's advice and set separate learning programs for boys and girls. Boys studied for jobs they were thought to be capable of when they grew older, physical labor, farming, handling cattle, gardening. The girls were taught the ""American"" way to cook, clean, sew, and keep a house.  (They took this a step further by making completely separate homes in different towns for the Osage children.) All children were required to speak English and honor Catholic teachings while shunning their own culture.
As early as 1901 zinc mining had begun in Quapaw Station, and in 1912 a large mine was established on the land of Benjamin Quapaw, a tribal elder. This became one of the richest zinc and lead fields in the world.

Construction of the school began in 1871 and classes began in 1872 with fewer than 50 students. Due to increased pressure after the Federal government took over in 1880, the enrollment increased to more than 135 by 1885.

It was supported bu the Quaker Friends' Church until 1880 when it became fully supported by the Federal Government. By the 1920s, the composition of the student body had changed, and was largely Cherokee students. The school had a capacity of 130 students.
The school offered education to children ages 4 - 18, initially offering curriculum through the fourth grade, later expanding to the ninth grade in the 1920's.

The schools superintendent often reported students not returning after Christmas breaks (the only break of the year, a Christian holiday.)
The school had an outbreak of measles and typhoid in 1927, and ""dozens of children"" died.
In 1928, a new principal was appointed, Joe Kagey. The school changed its admittance policy, and was opened to children of all tribes. It became an ""institutional"" school for children coming from situations of hardship. During this period, the school was known for having a successful athletic program in which their teams ranked among the best in the state in football, basketball, baseball, tennis and track. They held an ""Athletic Field Meet"" which included compitition in all sports. In 1952, there were 173 Cherokee students, and a 100 students from other tibes. Kagey retired in 1956.
The school closed on June 15, 1980. The school's 189 acres of land were returned to the Wyandotte Tribe.

The Tullahassee  school was originally founded in 1850 as the first of three boarding schools for the education of Creek children by the Creek Nation. The school was located at the confluence of the Arkansas and Verdigris Rivers on the northeastern edge of Creek Nation and served as the premier educational institution among the Creeks for many years.  In December 1880 the three-story brick school building was mostly destroyed in a fire.  The Creek Council used the opportunity to relocate the Indian boarding school to a new location and offered the burned-out building and the 100 improved acres surrounding the building to the African Creeks for use as a boarding school. The Council also provided funds to re-build the school, and with the cooperation of Baptist Home Mission Society reopened the school in 1883 as the Tullahassee Manual Labor School.   For many years Tullahassee was the only school in the Indian Territory to offer schooling beyond the elementary grades for Indian freedmen. The acreage around the school was expanded over the years to include 300 acres of orchards and cultivated fields and the school building itself was expanded in the late 1880s and early 1890s to accommodate 150 students. Tullahassee was the only freedman boarding school to remain open after tribal dissolution in 1906 and was operated by the Interior Department until 1914 when it was sold to Waggoner County and continued as a school for African American Oklahomans until 1924.",1824,,,,1883,1924,,,150,1

The institute, named for a nearby creek, which honored the Delaware, opened in October 1852 with Rev. Hamilton Balentine. Rev. Balentine remained superintendent until he was succeeded by Rev. Charles H Wilson in 1856-1859. In 1859 Rev. Balentine returned it seems for at least 1 year.
In later years, locals called the school Allen's Academy, for James S. Allen, who supervised the establishment, and later many used the name Rock Academy for the impressive stone building.
In 1860 the mission board withdrew their support, and the school closed.
During the Civil War the Confederates used the building as a hospital and a prison. After the war the academy reopened, serving male and female students. In 1883 the Post Office Department designated a Wapanucka post office for the institute.

Oklahoma,Wetumka Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wetumka_Boarding_School,,,1881,,,,Levering Manual Labor School,"In 1880 the Creek Council appropriated $5,000 for a manual labor school in the nation and Eugene Levering of Balitmore gave an equal amount. (Levering & his brother were wealthy coffee merchants and prominent churchmen of the Southern Baptist Convention. The school was in the southwest part of what was then the Creek Nation, near the north fork of the Canadian River, at the old home of Ward Coachman.
On September 1, 1881, the Levering Manual Labor Mission School, under the auspices of the Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention and partially supported by the Creek Nation, opened to 50 Creek boys and 50 Creek girls.
By 1902 Wetumka public school had an enrollment of 261 and employed three teachers and a principal, Rev. J.A. Trenchard (selected by the Southern Baptists).  land had been cleared for an orchard of 1,000 apple trees and 450 peach trees. The school farm produced 400 bushels of wheat, 250 bushels of oats, 1,000 lbs of beans, 850 lbs of green peas, 30 bushels of onions, 35 bushels of tomatoes, 40 bushels of potatoes, and 60 acres of corn. Girls were issued aprons, calico dresses, linsey dresses, plaid dresses, skirts, shoes and a handkerchief. Boys were issued coats, pants, socks, and shoes. All clothing was donated by the Southern Baptist Council of Women.
In January 1882, Trechard wrote ""Eighty cases of Measles among the pupils has been a serious drawback, but otherwise the school is doing well. Some of the students can not endure restraint, the discipline necessary at school, or their studies, so they run away and generally tell very large tales of 'starvation', 'hard work' and 'hard whippings'. The large majority are contented""
On May 26, 1883 Trechard wrote the Home Mission Board reporting the death of his wife on May 19; the school had owned 175 head of cattle on May 1st but they had disappeared and a member of the Creek Council thought they had been driven to Muskogee to be sold, and some to the Choctaw Nation. ""I fear drunkenness and thievery will nearly ruin us if no check can be put on these vile evils...""
Later in 1883 Trechard writes, ""At Christmas the parents came in and took out most of the children to spend Christmas at home. While at home a rebellion within the Creek Nation broke out, and only about half the students returned to school. After the rebellion was defeated by the Creek Nation, the pupils in attendance are recorded as 96 boys and 77 girls.
In December 1883, Trechman was replaced by Isreal G. Vore. Vore stated the school's need for a hospital, smoke house, milk and fruit houses; which Vore suggested could be of rock as it was cheaper to build with than wood. In 1885 the student population was up to 120 pupils. Dr. J. C. Wingo was sent from Eufala to teach and act as physician for the school. Books for the library were sent from Mission Boards in New York and Pennsylvania. The Creek Nation appropriated $7,000 to finish payment on the hospital.
By 1886 music was being taught, and the school employed many additional workers, such as; a gardener, a laundress, a herder, mechanic, & poultryman. Later that same hear Vore wrote to the trustees that the buildings were badly in need of repaid, particularly the chimneys. The beds were worn out. There were one hundrd students present. In 1886, fifty-six were females and one of them, Emma Bruner, died May 4.  Another loss was the death on October 10, 1887, when Goliah Herod died.
In January 1887, Major Vore died after being Superintendent for 4 years. J. 0. Wright became the new Super. The Woman's Baptist Home Mission Society of Maryland sent a set of wagon maker tools and blacksmithing tools worth $75.00. The school had a fine upright piano in addition to an organ. There was grown on the mission land 2500 bushels of eorn, one hundred tons of millet and prairie hay was put up for the winter. One hundred seventy cattle were owned by the missionaries and they brought fifty-five spring calves. There were eighty hogs, a good span of mules, one pony and a colt.
Because of illness the school closed on June 9, 1890. Dysentery had invaded the mission and Mr. Wright's little son, Bennie, was taken from his loving parents. Next Charlie Scott and Eliza Bruner were ""called to their long home. . . ."" On June 19 Miss Sarah Cundiff, the laundress, also died. Wright's report to Chief Perryman, dated September 1, 1890,to June 30, 1891, gave the number of pupils as one hundred eightgtwo; there had been considerable sickness, some cases serious.
In November 1938 classes were held in churches and the National Guard Armory after a fire destroyed the high school building.
On September 1, 1881, the Levering Manual Labor Mission School, under the auspices of the Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention and partially supported by the Creek Nation, opened in Wetumpka, Oklahoma to provide education for Creek children. It had a start-up cost of around $10,000 and at first had only crude log buildings. The school was gradually upgraded to framed buildings, with a 2-acre campus and additional 80-acres for fields and orchards. 10 acres were cleared for 1000 apple trees, and around 450 peach trees. In 1885 the school built it's only stone building; a hospital with the cost of $1400.
By 1891, grounds had been improved and a white fence separated the girls and boys sides of the campus. (The boys on the South side, the girls on the North.) The pupils were not segregated during classes but were segregated most all other times, including church. One common punishment for girls was to have rags tied to their feet and be made to mop whole floors of the dorms this way.
In an account written in 1887 inside ""The Gospel in All Lands"" produced by the Methodist Episcopal Church, there were approx. 100 boys & girls in attendance, all of whom lived at the school. In addition to the ""English education"" the students received, this book also recounts many girls being trained as teachers and young boys as preachers of the Methodist faith.
In 1883, the minutes of the 16th Annual Session of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, names Major J.G. Vore as Superintendent and claims over 100 Indian pupils.
In 1888, the 20th Annual Report of the Board of Indian Commissions reported Brother James O. Wright as Superintendent; saying the institution was ""never more prosperous"". This document also reports ""more than 150 students"" in attendance.
Buildings in 1891 included the hospital, a 2-story boys dorm, admin building, a doctor's home & office, several smaller girls dorms, commissary, meat house, smoke house, laundry, and ice house.

The church and school were overseen by physician and missionary Alfred Wright and his wife Harriet; who had traveled with the Choctaw tribe when they were expelled from their homeland and forced into Indian Territory. 
In 1839, Wright expanded the school by adding a large dormitory building and the school became the first Choctaw National Academy in 1842. Wright died in 1853 and Rev. John Edwards was named his replacement as Superintendent.
Children attending the Choctaw academies were ten to sixteen years old. When the boarding schools for females first opened, the girls were taught given English names and told that all instruction would be in English. They were forbidden to use their native language while they were at the school. The curriculum included sewing, making clothing and doing household chores. They also learned business skills, reading, writing and spelling in the English language. Additional courses included Arithmetic, music, and geography were also taught, and in some schools pupils learned algebra, geometry, chemistry, and philosophy.
Allegations of abuses abound at Wheelock Academy. Some members of the Choctaw Nation accuse children were regularly beaten, and stories of rape and the murder of children and babies exist at Wheelock.
It was closed during the Civil War (1861-1865) and briefly reopened until a fire in 1869. The Choctaw Nation rebuilt the facility in 1880 - 1884, with assistance from the Southern Presbyterian Church. Although the Presbyterian Home Missions Board and the Federal Government became involved in administering the school, it remained owned and financially supported by the Choctaw Nation. The 1898 Curtis Act had required the gradual closure of all tribal schools. By 1930, Wheelock and the Jones Academy in Hartshorne, Oklahoma were the only remaining Choctaw schools. In 1932, Wheelock became a United States Indian School. In 1955, its functions were merged with Jones Academy, and the Wheelock site was closed permanently
It is owned by the Choctaw Nation and is listed as a National Historic Landmark.
Local legend connected with this Wheelock Mission says hauntings at Wheelock Mission began in the 1890's when a white man broke into the girls’ mission and murdered some of the girls. Witnesses say that the walls and trees bleed, and apparitions sit in chairs or hang from trees.

In 1875, the large Ross mansion was enlarged and the school was prepared to care for one hundred or more orphans.
The farm consisted of about three hundred acres of land, approximately one-half of which was fertile bottom land, the other half consists of timber and pasture land. Horses, cattle and hogs were raised, and the bottom land produced abundant crops of corn, oats and wheat. The timber land furnished fuel for the home, and fencing and lumber for the improvement of the farm. Everlasting springs of pure water bubbled out of the nearby hillside, furnishing an abundant supply of pure water for the home and livestock.
For nearly a third of a century the Cherokees supported this institution entirely from their own tribal funds, expending annually about $12,500.00 for the support of about one hundred and fifty of their orphan boys and girls, but on the 17th day of November, 1903, the entire home, including the original building and the three wings which had been added was destroyed by fire. The fire occurred at noon, causing no loss of life but consuming almost the entire contents of the building.
About fifty of the orphans were transferred to the Whitaker Home at Pryor Creek and the others were cared for at Tahlequah. The orphan home, or asylum, as it was called, was never rebuilt, and a mound of old brick is all that is left to remind the Cherokees of their historic home which for thirty years was one of the institutions in which they manifested special pride.",1903,"Salina, OK",Victorian mansion,,1873,1903,,150,,0

In 1894, the Creek National Council approved the addition of 640 acres to the orphanage to be used as farm, garden, orchard, and cattle pasture.
Children admitted to the orphanage were required to stay until the age of 21, and children were only allowed to return home during the summer break if their family made a formal request. The famous Muskogee (Creek) poet Alexandar Posey served as superintendent of the orphanage for 2 years starting in 1895, and wrote 3 notable poems in his first year there.
In 1904 statehood was approved for Oklahoma, and the home reverted to a residence until the Federal government purchased the land during WWII. Before the purchase, in 1937, Johnson Tiger is recorded as superintendent of the orphanage. In 1943, the US government built Glennan Military Hospital on the former site of the school/residence. The military hospital was used to treat mostly African POW's coming from other prison camps. The military hospital camp was flanked by barbed wire with ditches dug around the perimeter. The hospital remained in operation until 1945, when the POWs were returned to their homes.
Shortly after 1945, the US government agreed to allow the Oklahoma A&M College system to purchase the campus for $1 million, and OK A&M opened a Tech School on campus on the basis of providing job skills to veterans. Programs on offer consisted of; diesel mechanics, baking, shoemaking, dry cleaning, watchmaking, electronic repairs, construction, and plumbing.

They remained there for 13 months until the new and permanent facility could be constructed. In October 1923, 66 boys and 48 girls, 21 men and 5 women were moved to the newly built Masonic Home. The Masonic Grand Lodge then began building a home for the aged, which occurred and the adult residents were moved there in 1927. As you can see, the children were not all boys, nor were they all orphans, as some people tend to think. This was a difficult time in our history with the depression, etc., and many families simply could not take care of their large families. At one time there were as many as 165 residents! The facility was closed in 1977 when there were only six children housed there. [1]

Oklahoma,Goodland Presbyterian Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Goodland_Presbyterian_Home,1835,1838.0,1835,Active,Cottage Plan,,Goodland Indian Orphanage | Yakni Achukma Mission Station | Goodland Academy,"In 1835, Ebenezer Hotchkins and Cyrus Kingsbury, Presbyterian ministers, established the Yakni Achukma (Choctaw for “Good Land”) Mission station. In 1838, William Fields, a full-blood Choctaw, built the first home on the Goodland campus. As the community grew, the most vital concern of the Indian people was the education of their children.
In 1848, the first full-time minister took up residency on the grounds of present day Good Land. John Lathrop and his wife built the first home and mission, and ministered for two years to the Choctaws. As they returned home in 1850, Rev. Oliver Porter Stark and his wife, Margaret, were assigned to Good Land. His wife began the next day teaching any Indian children that would come to their two room log home.
Orphaned children were boarded by families on the property, so they could receive an education. Within two years, the number had grown to 42 Indian children. This was the beginnings of the boarding school. In 1852, Oliver Porter Stark (the superintendent) — with help from Henry L. Gooding and other Choctaw neighbors — built the structure that served the community as both church and school. Stark also dug the first well, which was still being used in 1932 when it was sealed and covered by the present concrete steps of the old Goodland High School.
During the Civil War, two Choctaw Indian regiments pitched their tents on the campus around the well that Rev. Stark dug. Stark wrote to the mission board to report on the bands of robbers and lawlessness that existed in the area at the time. He requested reassignment and was transferred to Paris, Texas, in 1866.
After the Civil War, the division within the Presbyterian Church was disorganized and continued to leave the mission without pastor, teacher or mission board to guide or encourage the work. Apparently, each ""side"", North and South, assumed that the other would pick up the mission. During this period, Indian families and their white friends in the area continued the work begun by the missionaries. Rev. John P. Turnbull, an Indian Presbyterian minister, operated the church and school until 1890 when Joseph P. Gibbons was assigned to the Goodland Mission.
Finally, in 1894, the Goodland Mission became a special responsibility of the Presbyterian Church, US, General Assembly's Executive Committee of Home Missions. In 1894, Goodland children were living in the homes of area families. A school building and the first dormitory went up that year. The dormitory was built from hand-hewn logs to house sixteen Indian boys on Goodland Mission property. It was a crude building — one large room with a sleeping loft overhead and a kitchen/dining room added on one side. A large front porch provided extra living space.
Supplies for the orphans were donated from Indian families who lived nearby. Each week one of the church members took a wagon from house to house, receiving liberal contributions of meat, lard, meal, flour, potatoes, sugar, molasses and coal oil for the boys to use.
In 1900, Silas Bacon, who grew up in the home and became a Presbyterian minister, became the first superintendent. For twenty years Bacon served as superintendent of the school and during his administration four dormitories and a bath house were built. Several Indian families deeded land to the institution during those years, and by 1920 the school owned a total of 75 acres. By 1921, Goodland was serving 250 Indian children and had a school system and five dormitories.
The 1929 financial crash had serious repercussions in Oklahoma. Goodland had a debt of over $30,000. The church called Rev. E. D. Miller to supervise the home during this time of crisis. Through the help of many friends, he paid the outstanding debt within six years. He repaired and painted the older buildings, fireproofed the roofs, sod the campus with grass, planted gardens and orchards, and built a poultry flock and a dairy herd. He laid out gravel drives and concrete walks and added a tennis court and football field.
Another milestone occurred in 1930, when the Goodland public school consolidated with the Home's own school on campus. The gym and auditorium, constructed by Works Progress Administration workers, became a community center for the neighborhood. From that point, the Goodland Mission was, by all practical means, a boarding home with schooling on campus.
During the civil rights movement of the 1960s, ""the Presbyterian Church decided to open the door to others,"" and Non-Indians were welcomed. Normal wear and tear took their toll of the old dormitories, so smaller and safer cottages were built in the 1960s. During the 1970s, life at Goodland became ""wild and crazy,"" much like the decade itself. Officials solved that in 1981 when they stopped accepting girls.
The Church building served for 42 years as both school and church for the area. Renovated several times since being built in 1852, the same church — restored and enlarged — stands on the Goodland campus today. Goodland Academy (as it is now called) is still in operation as a home for children under 18 who have lost parents or been abandoned by them. It is considered the oldest private boarding school in Oklahoma. They have plans to build an entirely new & updated campus on the grounds.",,"Hugo, OK",,,1894,,,250,250,0

Scott and his wife in March 1903 after having taken into their home the baby of a woman who Mrs. Scott found living in an alley next to her husbands church. They raised the baby in their home until the formal opening of the Oklahoma Baptist Children's Home.
On June 1, 1903, the Home was moved to a frame building on one and a half stories and 4 bedrooms on West Pottawatomie Street, Oklahoma City. Nine children were in residence. In 1905, the joint Boards of the Baptist General Convention of Indian Territory and the Oklahoma State Baptist Convention accepted a bid from Oklahoma City of 40 acres of land and $2,000 to move the Home to its location at NW 63rd and Pennsylvania. Ownership of the Home was transferred to the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma in 1917. On these grounds stood more than twenty buildings caring for over four thousand children throughout the seventy-five years at this location.
Tragedy struck on January 17, 1920. Some children were cleaning stains out of clothing with gasoline, when Thomas Bain struck a match near the laundry. Thomas escaped with injuries from the explosion, but Lois Abbott, 16, was fatally burned. She was buried at Rose Hill Burial Park in the lot next to the Home. Thirteen other children are buried at Rose Hill in a plot that belongs to Oklahoma Baptist Homes for Children.
In 1936 Dr. Andrew Potter was the Superintendent over more than 150 children. The Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma in 1936 changed the name to Oklahoma Baptist Children's Home. It moved to 16301 South Western in June 1982.",,"Oklahoma City, OK",,>150,1903,,,4000,150,0
Oklahoma,Whitaker Children's Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Whitaker_Children%27s_Home,1895,,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Eastern Oklahoma School for White Children | Thunderbird Military Youth Academy | Oklahoma State Orphans Home | Whitaker State Orphans Home,"Founded in 1897 by area post trader Mr. W. T. Whitaker & his wife at their home on 40 acres of land located (at that time) ""one mile south-east of Pryor Creek, Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory"". The home was a modern two story stone building, with wrapping porch.
After the Civil War, the large influx of non-Indians into the Cherokee Nation created yet another problem. Frontier life being very harsh and primitive, as well as being without adequate medical care, cost many lives of these families. While there were facilities maintained by the Cherokee Nation for the care of the Indian orphans, the question arose as to what to do with the white children who survived their parents. One by one, many were taken into the household of the benevolently minded W. T. Whitaker family (who had 11 children of their own). As their ""family"" grew, so did the needs. This was the founding of Whitaker Children's Home.
There was also a lack of schools in Indian Territory for non-Indian children. The Whitakers provided for this with teachers, classrooms and training facilities. Mr. Whitaker had previously served in the military, and the home was run in military fashion. Mr. Whitaker believed in the saying ""A working child is a happy child."" The fate of the children living in Whitaker in the early 1900's was often one of indentured servitude. A lucky few were reunited with their families.
When the Cherokee Orphan Home burned in 1903, Mr. Whitaker then opened the doors of his home to the homeless Cherokees of the territory. Although crowded conditions prevailed, the children, with Federal aid ($10,000), were cared for by donations & a working farm until statehood came and the home was converted to the Whitaker State Orphan Home (1908) in 1908.
Under state ownership, the Whitaker Home grew to include 590 acres total, and thirty buildings in 1911. The main campus consisted of 40-acres, a 320-acre farm, 14 buildings housing 287 children and 25 staff. By 1943 the number of children approached 350. In 1950 a modern ""milking barn"", accommodating 120 Holstien cows. In 1954 a swimming pool was constructed. There was a building where the older girls learned to sew by making not only their own clothes, but the children who were too young had other assigned duties. The boys did farm and animal work.
For 30 years, the State Orphanage produced boxing & basketball programs. The Orphanage was re-named the Oklahoma State Home (1910), and then again re-named East Oklahoma Home for White Children (1919). As politics and social climate changed, it was re-named again in 1923 as whitaker State Orphan Home.
In 1921 a power house is built to power the campus' electricity. In 1932, two new brick cottages were built to replace some old wood frame cottages. . The Whitaker institution had
generally operated on a cottage rather than a dormitory plan with each unit, housing fifteen to twenty children, having its own kitchen and dining room, supplied by a central commissary. But in 1936, the Works Progress Administration built a new dining hall with three cold
storage units, an ice plant, and a bakery. Outlying buildings included a
state-of-the-art dairy built in 1933, a sale barn dating
from 1942, and a number of auxiliary buildings, as well as employee residences. Buildings added to the plant in 1940 were the laundry, and vocational building which served as the carpentry and upholstery shop.
In 1948 a new period of expansion and renovation began with the support of the citizens of Pryor and a state bond issue of $1.25 million. The result was fourteen new buildings and a swimming pool. These additions in the early 1950's included the administration building (now a National Guard Armory), and the clinic built in 1952. Several new cottages were added: McCarty Hall, Fern, Birch, Pine, Spruce--all built in 1951; Cedar, Poplar, Walnut--all built in 1952 and Comer, built in 1953. In 1960 a new gymnasium replaced the old facility.
Child population grew to more than 500 before the 1960s, when it began taking in the state's troubled juveniles. The home in 1962 switched roles from the care of orphaned children to juvenile-delinquent supervision. A major renovation in 1967 was the expansion of Whitaker Hall.
The 1983 auction papers state for sale ""640 acres of land which includes the 40-acre campus, 50-75 buildings, a meat packing plant, and 556 acres of farming land."" And in 1983 the property was transferred to the Oklahoma Military Department, who to this day rents the property to ""Thunderbird Military Youth Academy"", a modern reform school for ""troubled"" teen boys.
There is a small cemetery that is maintained for the children who died while residing at the home. The original tombstone has been maintained, but is weather worn. The people of Pryor copied the entries and have a new stone located nearby.
The cemetery is managed by the Oklahoma Military Department.",,"Pryor, OK",,>500,1897,1983,,,500,0

Opened after the State School at Pryor, this was Oklahoma's second official state orphanage. Enrollment 1919 was recorded as 164 children.
In 1937, the Oklahoma State Planning Board published an excerpt from a study of the home finding that children were fed meals costing 3.5 cents. The Orphanage was closed by the state in 1944.
From 1945 to 1948 and from 1956 through mid-1982 the State Training School for Boys operated on the property.
The property was reassigned to the Department of Corrections on May 24, 1982 and opened as The James Crabtree Correctional Center (a state penitentiary for men) with 1000 beds.
A reunion of ""graduates"" was held in about 1974. Then the organizers decided it should become an annual event, so they organized annual reunions for 21 years; second weekend in June, usually at Great Salt Plains State Park, not far from Helena. In 1997 they relocated the reunion to Piney Cove on Lake Eufaula. At the time in 1997, the President of the group of alumni was George and Martha Penkins.",1944,"Helena, OK",,approx. 400,1917,1944,1000,164,,0
