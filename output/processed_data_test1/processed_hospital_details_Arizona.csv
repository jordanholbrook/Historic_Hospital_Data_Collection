Arizona,Arizona State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Arizona_State_Hospital,1871.0,1886.0,1887.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Insane Asylum of Arizona | Territorial Asylum for the Insane | State Asylum for the Insane | Phoenix State Hospital,"Eight years after Arizona became a separate territory from New Mexico, the concept that mental illness is a state responsibility was first recognized by the Territorial Legislature. On February 17, 1871, legislation was enacted which stated that the various Boards of Supervisors of the counties must provide for the confinement of all insane persons, ""either in the County jail or in such other manner and place as shall be in their judgment be best for the safety of said insane person and of the community.""
In 1885, the 13th Territorial Legislature met to appropriate $100,000 for the construction of the ""Insane Asylum of Phoenix"" in Arizona. In addition, an Honorary Board of Directors of the Insane Asylum of Phoenix was established. County bonds were issued for $3,500 for 160 acres with water rights 2-1/2 miles east of Phoenix. Construction began in 1886, to accommodate up to 280 patients, taking eight months to complete.
The ""Insane Asylum of Phoenix"" opened early in January 1887, for 61 patients with the completion of ""D"" building. This was actually 3 buildings with 2 patient wings and a central administrative facility.
Under the Board's direction, the remaining 160 acres was cleared of brush for grain crops, a vegetable garden, a vineyard and an orchard with 2,000 trees. In addition, a small area was set aside for a staff and patient cemetery, which has 2400 graves dating back to 1888. Among those buried in ""All Souls Cemetery"" is Corporal Isaiah Mays, a Buffalo Soldier who earned the Congressional Medal of Honor.
A Board of Control replaced the Insane Asylum Board in 1895 (and was later disassembled in the 1940's), to establish policies and procedures regarding declarations of insanity, patient confinement, and terms of release. There was no legal process for confinement, and since they were few institutions, persons were committed reasons such as old age, tuberculosis, and ""feeble-mindedness.""
In 1902, the General Assembly of Arizona changed the hospital's name to the ""Territorial Asylum for the Insane"". By 1909, ""C"" building was under construction and 10 acres had been cleared for farming. After a fire in 1911, the Hospital was rebuilt in 1913, and named the ""State Asylum for the Insane"" when Arizona was voted into statehood. Two new buildings were completed — the Community Center with kitchen, dining room and auditorium, and ""C"" building.
By 1922, the patient population had climbed to 568 and was still increasing. In 1924, the Asylum was informally renamed Arizona State Hospital and the change was made legal in 1958. World War II created major staff shortages along with a sharp increase in patient admittance. Census rates rose to 998 in 1942, and then 1,200 in 1945.
During the 1940s, as medications were introduced by pharmaceutical companies, the Hospital played a leading role in trying new medications to help its clients. A social worker was hired during this time exclusively to discharge patients. By the early 1950s, the patient population was close to 1,800. Increases were attributed to state population influx, the admission of Japanese patients from war relocation centers and war casualties. During this period, new patients were required to appear before an insanity board, and few were declared ""insane"".
In 1970, during the height of the human rights movement, the Arizona Legislature passed Senate Bill 1057 (A.R.S. § 3655) which required that a patient must be dangerous to themselves or others in order to be confined to the hospital. Restrictions were such that made it impossible to get in and easy to be released. Many patients who had been at the hospital for years were released in downtown Phoenix and the patient census dropped from almost 2,000 to 300 within a few months. In 1973, Governor Williams and the Arizona Legislature created the Arizona Department of Health Services. Within this department fell the Division of Behavioral Health Services to oversee mental health services for the State Department of Health and Arizona State Hospital
In the 1980s, ADHS and ASH were sued in court case Arnold v. Sarn. The decision passed in 1989, which stated that ""Arizona has failed to meet its moral and legal obligations to our state's chronically mentally ill population."" The decision required a push toward community-based programs and services for discharged patients. During the 1990s, concern about mental health became a federal issue, generating reports from the Surgeon General's office and from high-ranking advocates. The Arizona State Hospital adopted Psychiatric Rehabilitation, a new model of patient care that encompassed all disciplines.
Upon his death in 1925 Cpl. Mays was interred in ""All Souls Cemetery"" with a small numbered head stone as the only marker placed at his grave. In 2001, the marker was replaced with an official United States Department of Veterans Affairs headstone which stated his name, service history, and his status as a Medal of Honor recipient. Eight years later, in March 2009 under the care of the Old Guard Riders Inc., Cpl Mays' remains were disinterred, cremated and placed in an urn designed especially for him. On 29 May 2009, in a ceremony befitting a Medal of Honor recipient, Cpl Mays was interred in Arlington National Cemetery [1]

Arizona,Phoenix Indian School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Phoenix_Indian_School,,,1891.0,Active,Cottage Plan,,Steele Indian School,"After a year-long search for a school site, the Indian School opened in 1891 on 160 acres of land. Up until 1931, the federal ""assimilation"" policy that sought to regimentalize and culturally exterminate Native American students was in place. The first superintendent was Wellington Rich and Harwood Hall. By 1896 there were 380 students, in comparison to just 100 at its 1891 founding. It had twelve buildings, including a ""girls building"", designed by prominent local architect J.M. Creighton, and a Victorian-style hospital. However, there were only four academic teachers by 1897. Vocational training was instead the emphasis: boys learned business skills and girls domestic skills. Like other ""successful"" Indian Schools like Carlisle, students worked at off-campus jobs to gain experience and earn money, as well as to help assimilate them. However, unlike Carlisle, the students did not live with one particular family, but were instead cheap contract labor. Due to several incidents and the abuses, the idea of assimilation through employment quickly went out the window; as it became a way for white Phoenix employers to procure cheap Native American child labor. In 1897, another new superintendent took the role at PIS, Samuel McCowan. He continued an emphasis on increasing enrollment but also realized that academics had to improve. He diversified the student body, recruiting Mojaves and Hopis from all over the southwest. The aggressive recruitment that closed the 1890s made the Indian School the second largest school in the federal system, with over 700 students. Overcrowding accompanied the rapid growth, and during McCowan's tenure, he built new dormitories and employee residences. A Mission Revival style auditorium was designed in 1901 and constructed the next year. As increasing enrollment made it clear to administrators that a dining hall was needed, the design modifications to turn the auditorium into one were performed in 1903 and a kitchen was built in 1904. The Dining Hall is the oldest extant building on the PIS campus. 1902 brought another new superintendent, Charles Goodman. He inherited a stable school with 56 employees (12 of which were teachers) and a 24-building campus surrounded by 240 acres (97 ha) of farm land. A series of major events took place in his tenure (which lasted until 1915), including a major tuberculosis outbreak, but Goodman's time as superintendent was also characterized with the first real progress in graduating students. By 1915, a total of 175 students had received diplomas from the PIS – none had done so before 1901. This was just under five percent of the student body, but it proved from a federal perspective that assimilation was finally occurring. During this time period in PIS's history, various techniques were used to attempt better assimilation – new students were organized into military companies, given a uniform and work clothes, and marched to and from classes after starting at 5am. Despite not being citizens, many students and alumni volunteered to fight in World War I. Within four months of President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of war on Germany in April 1917, 64 PIS students and alumni volunteered to serve in the army and navy. Though Superintendent Brown was personally committed to assimilation, the environment began to change in the 1920s. After 1915, Indian schools began to face troubles, such as overcrowding and budget cuts. Discipline problems increased, and the quality of student health care at Indian schools nationwide declined. In response to these issues, a reform movement began in the early 1920s led by John Collier. Carl H. Skinner succeeded John Brown as superintendent of the Phoenix Indian School in 1931. Two of his first changes had some of the largest impact. The military discipline was no more; students did not have to wear uniforms, and the band no longer marched students into the dining hall. As reservation day schools were built, the lower grades at PIS were discontinued. This brought the enrollment down from 950 in 1928 to 425 in 1936. After assimilation attempts and Federal Indian Reform Schools were discontinued in the 1950's and 1960's, Phoenix Indian School became a public Indian School, serving 7th-12th grades. In 1984 it combined with 3 other nearby High Schools with a new total of 5,000 students. After the schools offical closure in 1990, the buildings sat vacant for several years before being transformed infto the city's Steele Indian School Park, which opened in 2001.

Arizona,Tuba City Boarding School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tuba_City_Boarding_School,,,1898.0,Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Blue Canyon School,"Tuba City Boarding School was established in 1898 under the authority of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for the education of Native American children in Northern Arizona. The first school was located in Blue Canyon, 25 miles southeast of Tuba City and was known as the Blue Canyon School. The BIA paid Mormon missionaries to operate and teach the school. Later, the school was moved to Moenave, AZ just four miles west of Tuba City.
Finally in 1901, the school relocated to its present location in Tuba City, AZ. The original buildings after 1901 (many of which still stand) were made of sandstone blocks that were quarried out of nearby Moenkopi Wash by Navajo and Hopi stone masons. The school was designed to be self-sufficient with its own bakery, farm, and laundry.
The original school could handle 75 students and followed the directive of those days of trying to assimilate the children into main stream anglos society by forcing them to wear uniforms and punishing them for speaking their own language or taking part in traditional religious ceremonies. Students spent a half day in lessons and a half-day doing labor on the farm or workshops.
From its beginning up until the 1940s, the school was operated by the Department of the Army. Then in the 1950s the school came under the direction of the Department of the Interior. About that time; ""“Tuba City Boarding School. That was the worse I went to,” says Roy Smith, a Navajo born in 1950 who went to several boarding schools beginning in 1959. “If you get caught talking Navajo to another student, your name is on the list. And the way they used to do it was they'd get a bar of soap, and they'd shave it off with the pocketknife, and then they mix it with water. Then that's what you use to rinse your mouth. Don't ever use another word of Navajo.”",,"Tuba City, Navajo County, AZ",,,,,,,,1
