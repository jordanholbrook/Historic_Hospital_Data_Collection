Alabama,Bryce Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bryce_Hospital,,1852.0,1861,Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Samuel Sloan,"Alabama Insane Hospital,  | Bryce Hospital for the Insane, | Tuscaloosa State Hospital","The planning for a state hospital for the mentally ill in Alabama began in 1852. The new facility was planned from the start to utilize the ""moral architecture"" concepts of 1850's activists Thomas Kirkbride and Dorothea Dix. Architect Samuel Sloan designed the imposing Italianate building after Kirkbride's model plan. The construction was an important source of employment in Reconstruction-era Tuscaloosa. The facility was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.
Dix's reformist ideas, in particular, are credited as the driving force behind the construction of the ""Alabama Insane Hospital,"" which was later renamed for its first superintendent, Peter Bryce, a 27-year-old psychiatric pioneer from South Carolina. His tenure was marked by absolute discipline among the staff of the hospital. He demanded that patients be given courtesy, kindness and respect at all times. The use of shackles, straitjackets and other restraints was discouraged, and finally abandoned altogether in 1882. Various work programs and other activities were encouraged, including farming, sewing, maintenance and crafts. Between 1872 and the early 1880s, some of the patients wrote and edited their own newspaper, called The Meteor. These writings provide a rare inside look at life in a progressive mental institution in the late 19th century. At that time, Bryce's management and commitment to ""scientific treatments"" was recognized around the country as in a class of its own.
During the 20th century, however, the patient population expanded while standards of care fell to abysmal levels. Alabama Governor Lurleen Wallace was appalled after viewing the facility in February 1967, and earnestly lobbied her husband, George Wallace (who held the actual power of her governorship) for more funds for the institution.
In 1970, Alabama ranked last among U.S. states in funding for mental health. Bryce Hospital at that time had 5,200 patients living in conditions that a Montgomery Advertiser editor likened to a concentration camp. That same year, a cigarette tax earmarked for mental health treatment was cut. 100 Bryce employees were laid off, including 20 professional staff. Members of the Department of Psychology at the University of Alabama attempted to file suit on behalf of the fired workers, but Federal Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled that the courts had no standing to intervene on behalf of fired employees. He left open, however, the possibility of a suit filed on behalf of patients, whose quality of care was not affected. [1]
1852: Alabama Insane Hospital established by the Alabama Legislature on a 326-acre tract adjacent to the University of Alabama.
1860: Peter Bryce, 26, elected first superintendent. During his tenure, Bryce abolishes straitjackets and restraints and insists on treating patients with dignity and respect.
1861: The immense hospital, built on the model developed by Thomas Kirkbride and Samuel Sloan, opens. It features running water, flush toilets, gas lighting and is the first building in Tuscaloosa to have gas lights and central steam heat.
1865: From the hospital's dome, observers watch Union troops burn the University of Alabama.
1900: The state Legislature renames the hospital for Bryce, who died in 1892.
1949: A report finds the state's two mental hospitals, Bryce and Searcy near Mobile, have an average daily patient population of 5,732 with 10 full-time staff physicians, the largest patient load of any state in the nation at the time.
1970: A class-action lawsuit in federal court, Wyatt vs. Stickney, alleges that persons involuntarily committed to Bryce were not being treated. At the time, Alabama is 50th out of the 50 states in spending for the care of people with mental illness or mental retardation in public institutions, allotting 50 cents per day per patient.
1971: U.S. District Court Judge Frank Johnson rules persons committed for treatment have a constitutional right to receive treatment.
1972: Johnson issues minimum standards for mental health and mental retardation facilities.
1995: U.S. District Court Judge Myron Thompson releases several mental health facilities from supervision under the Wyatt case and finds the department in compliance with about a third of the mental illness and mental retardation standards.
1996: The Mary Starke Harper Center on the Bryce campus opens as the first psychiatric facility in the country designed specifically for geriatric patients.
2003: Thompson terminates Wyatt vs. Stickney case after 33 years. [2]
2015: As part of a $60 million restoration project, the outer east & west wings were demolished. The center administration building and adjoining wings are going to be preserved and used as a preserving arts center.
There are 4 cemeteries located on the grounds. The oldest cemetery features at least thirty-seven marked graves, the earliest of which dates to 1892. There are an undetermined number of unmarked burials. It is speculated that these burials were originally part of Old Bryce Cemetery, located north of here, but were moved during the construction of River Road in the 1960's. Another cemetery was established in 1922 and was closed for burials in 1953. It contains approximately 1550 burials mostly marked with simple, chronological numbered concrete grave markers that correspond to cemetery ledger books in the possession of The Alabama Department of Mental Health.

Robert Jemison Jr. was a Confederate senator, businessman, and entrepreneur. His business empire grew to encompass toll roads and bridges, a grist mill, a sawmill, livery stables, a hotel, and six plantations totaling over 10,000 acres. Jemison was one of the leaders who built support for the Alabama State Hospital for the Insane, later renamed Bryce Hospital, which opened in 1861 in Tuscaloosa.
After his death in 1871, Jemison’s largest plantation, known as Cherokee Place, was bequeathed to the State of Alabama Board of Mental Health. During the Segregation Era, a separate facility was established for African-American patients. The building known as the Jemison Center was constructed a short drive from the main campus in Northport on what was once Cherokee Place and named for Jemison’s generosity. Before the Jemison Center was built, African-American patients were housed in the lofts of the barn at Bryce Hospital.
The approach to treatment at Bryce followed the concept that patient work was an important component of mental healthcare. Patients housed at the Jemison Center would tend the fields around the property. This was a part of the self-sustainability of Bryce as well as a way to feed a large number of patients with limited state funding.
However, by the 1960s, the concept of patients remaining in the hospital for long periods of time, while at the same time working productively, became a subject of public concern. Many citizens felt that the hospital retained patients as a source of free labor.
In 1970, the Jemison Center made headlines after a journalist from the Tuscaloosa News visited the facility and reported on the abhorrent conditions. “Human feces were caked on the toilets and walls; urine-soaked aging floors; many beds lacked linens; patients were sleeping on the floor. One small shower served 131 male patients; the 75 female patients only had one shower too. Most of the patients at Jemison were highly tranquilized and appeared to have not bathed in days. All appeared to lack any semblance of treatment. The stench was almost unbearable.”
Conditions at the Jemison Center and at Bryce Hospital in Tuscaloosa led to a landmark lawsuit – Wyatt v. Stickney. At that time, Bryce Hospital had over 5,000 patients living in intolerable conditions that the Montgomery Advertiser compared to a ‘concentration camp.’ Wyatt and his aunt testified about the improper treatment designed to only make patients more manageable.
In 1971, the lawsuit was expanded to include patients at Alabama’s other inpatient mental health facilities. The resulting court-ordered agreements formed the basis for federal minimum standards for the care of people with mental illness who reside in institutional settings known as the Wyatt Standards. The standards are founded on four criteria for evaluation of care: humane psychological and physical environment, qualified and sufficient staff for administration of treatment, individualized treatment plans, and minimum restriction of patient freedom.
After 33 years, the case of Wyatt v. Stickney came to a conclusion. Through a tenure of nine Alabama governors and fourteen state mental health commissioners, the case was the longest mental health case in national history. The State of Alabama estimates its litigation expenses at over $15 million.",1977,"Northport, Alabama",,206,,,,,,1

In the late 1880s the arsenal was used to confine captured Native Americans including Geronimo. The land was deeded to the state of Alabama in 1895 and the hospital was built in 1902 to relieve overcrowding at Bryce State Hospital.
Mount Vernon Hospital for the colored insane, now known as Searcy Hospital, was opened in May 1902. Prior to the opening of the Mount Vernon facility, African
American patients were maintained in segregated quarters at Bryce State Hospital in Tuscaloosa, which opened in1860. The 1863 annual report reflects an all white patient population. However, by 1868 annual reports indicates a payment of $1900 by the Freedman’s Bureau to care for the twenty-six African American patients at the facility. By the end of 1902, four hundred African American patients were at the Mount Vernon facility.
It served African-Americans exclusively until 1969, when it was desegregated after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted. On May 26, 1988, the Mount Vernon Arsenal/Searcy Hospital Complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a Historic District. The current site is made up of 25 buildings over 360 acres. The modern-day Searcy Hospital currently has 408 extended-care beds and a 124-bed intermediate care unit for patients with severe mental illness. It also serves the female forensic in-patient psychiatric center for the southern 1/3 of Alabama. From wiki and state archives
A map of the site suggests there could be at least 740 graves, laid out in tight formations that form a peculiar shape.

Alabama,Alabama Boys' Industrial School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Alabama_Boys%27_Industrial_School,1899.0,,1911,Active,Cottage Plan,,Birmingham Boys Industrial School,"The Alabama Boys Industrial School was a reformatory school for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents in Roebuck. The school was established through the efforts of Elizabeth Johnston, who argued strongly for remedial education for boys who were more often sent into the coal mines as leased convicts. She headed a committee of the Alabama Federation of Women's Clubs which recommended that such a school be governed by volunteers who were also mothers of boys, thereby keeping the institution's focus on its mission rather than on the political ambitions of its directors.
The Federation successfully lobbied the Alabama State Legislature for $3,000 to start the school, which was chartered on February 1, 1899. It began operating in a log cabin on the site of the former George Roebuck plantation on Roebuck Spring with five offenders assigned from the Birmingham Municipal Court. The state agreed to provide $12.50 per month for each boy remanded to the school's care and was also petitioned from time to time for additional funds for construction and maintenance.
Johnston served as president of the board and lived in a house on campus. She insisted that bars and locks should not be used on the dormitories and addressed the boys assigned to her care as ""son"". The school grew produce on campus and also operated a dairy which supplied the cafeteria kitchen. It was noted for the excellence of its brass band, which received funding for instruments and uniforms through the Rotary Club of Birmingham. Students also published a journal, The Boys Banner, which was printed on the school's own presses.
The Alabama Boys Industrial School grew quickly and housed 383 wards by March 1918. It became a model for state reformatories during the 1920s. Johnston remained the head of Boys Industrial School until her death in 1934. Only boys properly committed by one of the Juvenile, or other Courts with proper jurisdiction, can be received here. Boys must be between the ages of twelve and sixteen, inclusive. All boys were committed for an indefinite time extending through their minority, that is, until the boy becomes twenty-one years of age.
By 1969 the Boys Industrial School had 202 students. The treatment of white boys at the Roebuck facility and of white girls at the Alabama State Training School for Girls in Chalkville was contrasted sharply with the treatment of African American offenders at the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children at Mt Meigs, near Montgomery, where offenders were subjected to hard labor and corporal punishment rather than to education and other remedial programs.

Only two years after founding the school, the Protestant Women of Birmingham turned it over to the state in 1911. After moving to several locations in Birmingham, the Alabama Training School for Girls found a home in Chalkville in 1937, where it would remain for seven decades and undergo another name change, this time to Department of Youth Services, Chalkville Campus.
The State Training School for Girls was expanded in 1938 which included the addition of new cottages, a swimming pool, a church, and an administration building that contained a hospital and clinic. The work was undertaken by the Works Progress Administration with the stone used being cut from a nearby quarry and supplied by the Civilian Conservation Corps.  In 1949, the Birmingham Federation of Labor investigated allegations that the conditions at the school were deplorable.

The site chosen in 1848 for the school was an 80-acre farm at North Fork Town, near what is now Eufaula, OK. About 30 acres was fenced. Included on the property was a 20 square foot house with porch and kitchen, a stable, chicken house and a few fruit trees. The site and these improvements cost $300.
The first classes were held in the log house on August 8, 1848, with the Reverend W. S. Cobb as teacher in the log house that already existed on the property. The classes continued in the log house until the new buildings were ready to use in 1850. A stone and brick building 110 feet long, 34 feet wide and three stories high was built with materials shipped by boat from Louisville, via the Arkansas River, then overland to the site by ox-drawn wagons. The U.S. Government paid $5,000 from the funds appropriated for the Creeks under a treaty in 1845, and the balance of the total cost of $9,169 was paid by the Board of Missions of the M. E. Church, South.
The building contained 21 rooms, large halls and would accommodate 100 students and the faculty. In 1848 the annual report to the IMC records that there were 30 Creek students, one local preacher, 24 white teachers and staff and a small balance of $6.75 on hand. The school continued to be maintained by the Creek’s appropriated funds.
The Civil War and Reconstruction was devastating to Indian Territory. Rev. Thomas Bertholf was appointed Superintendent of Asbury school that had been destroyed in the war. Through Creek Chief, Samuel Checote, he secured an appropriation of $6,000 from the U.S. government for the task of rebuilding and reopening the school. Bertholf did not live long enough to accomplish the task. John Harell was then appointed superintendent of the Mission. In 1868 the main building was destroyed by fire. Using his considerable influence with the Creeks and government officials, Rev. Harrell had new buildings built and the school reopened in 1870.
The school burned in 1881 and again for the final time in 1887, never to reopen. Rev. Thomas Bertholf, and Rev. John Harrell, both of whom died during their administrations, were buried on the school grounds. When the present day Lake Eufaula was built the cemetery was relocated to Eufaula’s Greenwood Cemetery and the old school site and cemetery disappeared under the waters of the new lake.
The town became mostly abandoned when a railroad line was built just northwest of there in 1873, and by 1893 the post office for the area was closed in favor of opening one in the town of Eufala which was forming along the railroad.",1887,"North Fork Town, OK (near Eufala)",,,1849.0,1887.0,,,100.0,0
Alabama,Mountain View Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mountain_View_Hospital,1918.0,,1926,Active,Single Building,,Madru Inzer Memorial Hospital  | Etowah County Tuberculosis Sanitarium | District IV Tuberculosis Hospital | Mountain View Tuberculosis Hospital,"Mountain View Hospital is a private, specialized psychiatric hospital serving children through senior adults. Accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, Mountain View Hospital is the only treatment facility of its kind that offers a complete continuum of inpatient and outpatient services throughout Alabama.
The History of Mountain View Hospital actually begins long before the name and the building that stands at 3001 Scenic Highway today. Before Mountain View Hospital became known as an emotional and behavioral healthcare facility, it was a nursing home, an alcohol dependency center and a tuberculosis hospital.
In 1918, Etowah County began its first attempt to fight the dreaded disease tuberculosis by establishing a “fresh air camp” near Harts Avenue atop Lookout Mountain. The original camp was six canvas and lumber tent structures that served as treatment and care for patients suffering from tuberculosis. The prevailing belief was that the fresh air on the mountain would aid in treating the condition. During this time, several counties began implementing such camps a treatment for the disease. After eight years of operation, in 1926, the camp was destroyed by fire.
In 1926, construction began on what would replace the destroyed camp. After construction was completed, the hospital was officially designated the Madru Inzer Memorial Hospital but would become known as the Etowah County Tuberculosis Sanitarium. Over the coming years, the Hospital would provide exceptional care that would place it as one of the most effective hospitals for treating tuberculosis in the South.
While the hospital was primarily focused on the treatment of tuberculosis, the care that was provided would include treating alcohol dependency as a secondary condition. The discovery that alcohol rapidly advanced the disease of tuberculosis would provide a basis for comprehensive treatment at the facility and would aid in eventually finding ways to control the disease more effectively. By the early 1950s, it was becoming increasingly evident that additional facilities were needed to treat the overwhelming number of tuberculosis patients in the area. The original Hospital was built to accommodate sixteen patients, but was seeing in excess of twenty-one.
In November 1953, work began on a new tuberculosis facility that would house a larger number of patients and provide greater services. The new District IV Tuberculosis Hospital would provide care for up to 145 patients. Equipped with the latest in x-ray equipment, a modern laundry, kitchen, recreation facilities, a canteen, sun-room space and modern patient rooms. Built at a total cost of 1.2 million dollars, the Hospital was financed by several local counties (Etowah, Butler, Blount, Calhoun, Cherokee, Clay, Cleburne, DeKalb, Russell and Talladega Counties) with a 2-for-1 match from the Federal government’s Hill-Burton Hospital Aid Bill. The State of Alabama provided $200,000; the seven county groups provided another $200,000 with the remaining $800,000 being provided by the Federal grants. Upon completion, the facility encompassed a total of 66,000 square feet with 386 rooms.
On January 1, 1972, the Hospital officially changed its name from District IV Tuberculosis Hospital to Mountain View Tuberculosis Hospital. The change was partially due to changes in government funding for TB treatment as well as the desire of many of the counties originally involved in the Hospital withdrawing their support to pursue other areas of need in their communities.
Mountain View began expansion of services to include chronic diseases such as asthma, black lung, arthritis and diabetes. Probate Judge Willey Hickman recommended using the unused beds in the facility for the mentally ill. His recommendation was made to the State Mental Health Department that took the idea as a possible solution to problems of behavioral health in the state. By December of 1974, the Hospital expanded its operational mission from the treatment of tuberculosis to officially become a chronic disease hospital.
In 1979, Dr. Talley, medical director, received certification for 30 beds in the Hospital to be earmarked as residential detoxification and follow-up treatment care. This was a natural extension of the treatment philosophy of the Hospital’s days as a tuberculosis treatment Hospital because of the correlation between alcohol and tuberculosis.
By 1981, the Hospital had begun providing care for extended care patients and took on more nursing home operations. During that same year, the Hospital was sold to Baptist Hospital of Gadsden, Inc., at the time the owners and operators of the Baptist Hospital located in Gadsden. The Hospital employed between 75 and 100 workers.
In September of 1990, the Hospital expanded services by completing work on the Children’s Treatment Unit. This part of the Hospital was devoted entirely to children between the ages of 5 and 11. Prior to the completion of this new addition, the Hospital treated adolescents no younger than 12 years of age. Because the need had been recognized for some time, the Hospital decided to staff an entire Unit with professionals whose expertise was emotional and behavioral problems in children.
In May 1991, Southeastern Psychiatric Management, Inc., began day-to-day operations of the Hospital and began to focus on expanding outpatient services to all areas of AL. In addition to the hospital in Gadsden, Southeastern Psychiatric Management, Inc. operates outpatient behavioral health clinics in Gadsden, Anniston, Fort Payne, Opelika and Montgomery. Mountain View hospital currently has a 68 bed capacity in addition to a 40 bed residential unit devoted entirely to adolescents.

The History of Mountain View Hospital actually begins long before the name and the building that stands at 3001 Scenic Highway today. Before Mountain View Hospital became known as an emotional and behavioral healthcare facility, it was a nursing home, an alcohol dependency center and a tuberculosis hospital.
In 1918, Etowah County began its first attempt to fight the dreaded disease tuberculosis by establishing a “fresh air camp” near Harts Avenue atop Lookout Mountain. The original camp was six canvas and lumber tent structures that served as treatment and care for patients suffering from tuberculosis. The prevailing belief was that the fresh air on the mountain would aid in treating the condition. During this time, several counties began implementing such camps a treatment for the disease. After eight years of operation, in 1926, the camp was destroyed by fire.
In 1926, construction began on what would replace the destroyed camp. After construction was completed, the hospital was officially designated the Madru Inzer Memorial Hospital but would become known as the Etowah County Tuberculosis Sanitarium. Over the coming years, the Hospital would provide exceptional care that would place it as one of the most effective hospitals for treating tuberculosis in the South.
While the hospital was primarily focused on the treatment of tuberculosis, the care that was provided would include treating alcohol dependency as a secondary condition. The discovery that alcohol rapidly advanced the disease of tuberculosis would provide a basis for comprehensive treatment at the facility and would aid in eventually finding ways to control the disease more effectively. By the early 1950s, it was becoming increasingly evident that additional facilities were needed to treat the overwhelming number of tuberculosis patients in the area. The original Hospital was built to accommodate sixteen patients, but was seeing in excess of twenty-one.
In November 1953, work began on a new tuberculosis facility that would house a larger number of patients and provide greater services. The new District IV Tuberculosis Hospital would provide care for up to 145 patients. Equipped with the latest in x-ray equipment, a modern laundry, kitchen, recreation facilities, a canteen, sun-room space and modern patient rooms. Built at a total cost of 1.2 million dollars, the Hospital was financed by several local counties (Etowah, Butler, Blount, Calhoun, Cherokee, Clay, Cleburne, DeKalb, Russell and Talladega Counties) with a 2-for-1 match from the Federal government’s Hill-Burton Hospital Aid Bill. The State of Alabama provided $200,000; the seven county groups provided another $200,000 with the remaining $800,000 being provided by the Federal grants. Upon completion, the facility encompassed a total of 66,000 square feet with 386 rooms.
On January 1, 1972, the Hospital officially changed its name from District IV Tuberculosis Hospital to Mountain View Tuberculosis Hospital. The change was partially due to changes in government funding for TB treatment as well as the desire of many of the counties originally involved in the Hospital withdrawing their support to pursue other areas of need in their communities.
Mountain View began expansion of services to include chronic diseases such as asthma, black lung, arthritis and diabetes. Probate Judge Willey Hickman recommended using the unused beds in the facility for the mentally ill. His recommendation was made to the State Mental Health Department that took the idea as a possible solution to problems of behavioral health in the state. By December of 1974, the Hospital expanded its operational mission from the treatment of tuberculosis to officially become a chronic disease hospital.
In 1979, Dr. Talley, medical director, received certification for 30 beds in the Hospital to be earmarked as residential detoxification and follow-up treatment care. This was a natural extension of the treatment philosophy of the Hospital’s days as a tuberculosis treatment Hospital because of the correlation between alcohol and tuberculosis.
By 1981, the Hospital had begun providing care for extended care patients and took on more nursing home operations. During that same year, the Hospital was sold to Baptist Hospital of Gadsden, Inc., at the time the owners and operators of the Baptist Hospital located in Gadsden. The Hospital employed between 75 and 100 workers.
In September of 1990, the Hospital expanded services by completing work on the Children’s Treatment Unit. This part of the Hospital was devoted entirely to children between the ages of 5 and 11. Prior to the completion of this new addition, the Hospital treated adolescents no younger than 12 years of age. Because the need had been recognized for some time, the Hospital decided to staff an entire Unit with professionals whose expertise was emotional and behavioral problems in children.
In May 1991, Southeastern Psychiatric Management, Inc., began day-to-day operations of the Hospital and began to focus on expanding outpatient services to all areas of AL. In addition to the hospital in Gadsden, Southeastern Psychiatric Management, Inc. operates outpatient behavioral health clinics in Gadsden, Anniston, Fort Payne, Opelika and Montgomery. Mountain View hospital currently has a 68 bed capacity in addition to a 40 bed residential unit devoted entirely to adolescents. Southeastern Psychiatric Management, Inc. employees more than 230 mental health professionals. [1]",,"Gadsden, AL",,,1926.0,,68.0,,145.0,0

Alabama,Jefferson Tuberculosis Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Jefferson_Tuberculosis_Sanatorium,,,1910,Active,Single Building,,Lakeshore Hospital | Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital,"At the urging of Reverend George Eaves and health officer Robert Harkness, an Anti-Tuberculosis Association of Jefferson County was established in 1910 and erected an infirmary, originally consisting of canvas tents on Cahaba Road in what is now English Village. The project was supported by the Birmingham Chapter of the American Red Cross, the Board of Lady Managers for Hillman Hospital (which did not admit infectious patients), the Graduate Nurses Association, and various public and private organizations.  The camp on Red Mountain acted in tandem with a dispensary in downtown Birmingham. The dispensary investigated reports of new cases, referred incipient cases for treatment, and monitored former patients recovering at home. The camp itself was initially open only to white patients. It accepted its first patient in August 1910 and treated 78 people over the course of its first year, reporting good results.
In response to the rising number of cases, the Birmingham community saw the need to establish a tuberculosis hospital. Land along Lakeshore Drive was donated in 1923 and the Jefferson Tuberculosis Sanatorium officially opened in December 1925. In 1921 the Association relocated to a newly-donated 45-acre site off of Montgomery Highway in Shades Valley. A new facility, now called the Davenport Building was designed by architect Bem Price. The anticipated budget for the building was around $110,000, but when it opened on June 3, 1925 it was reported that $250,000 had been spent. A ""Third Main Building"" was completed adjoining it in 1937.
In 1973 the Sanatorium transitioned to Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital. Rather than hire administrators, the Board of Directors contracted Baptist Healthcare System to manage the hospital for a few years.",1973 (as a TB hospital),"Birmingham, AL",,,1925.0,1973.0,,78.0,,0

Keeler Tuberculosis Hospital,"Established in 1843, the United States Marine Hospital of Mobile has served a variety of purposes ranging from providing care for United States servicemen to a tuberculosis hospital. From 1861 to 1865, the hospital was even used by an occupying force of Confederates for use as a military hospital for soldiers who fought against the United States during the Civil War.
Shortly after that war, the building was returned to the government of the United States and by 1870, the hospital had reopened. The hospital's use declined following World War II and in 1952, the military converted the hospital to serve as an out-patient clinic for the residents of Mobile. Shortly after the US Government ceded control of the building to the State of Alabama, the former Marine hospital was utilized as a tuberculosis sanatorium. On May 22, 1974, the building was accepted into the National Register of Historic Places. The building now serves as the home of the Mobile County Health Department and includes a medical clinic.",1974,"Mobile, Alabama",,,,,,,,1
