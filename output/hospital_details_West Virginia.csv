Part of that property included two buildings formerly dorms of Morris Harvey College, which had moved to Charleston in 1935 and would eventually become the University of Charleston.  It would take a year to recondition these buildings and install the necessary fixtures.  The hospital's original designation was the Barboursville Unit of the Weston State Hospital upon opening January 20, 1942.  By August 1st of that year the hospital had reached it's capacity of 270 patients.  The state soon made further renovations to accommodate 315 patients.
Renamed the Barboursville Unit of the Huntington State Hospital by the state legislature in 1947, Barboursville would also receive a new administration building and a new storage building.  Finally receiving its last name during the 1949 session of the state legislature, the hospital also was appropriated a separate laundry building and renovations for the existing structures.  These changes removed the last administrative functions from the dormitory buildings to the Admin Building, increasing the capacity once again to 402 beds.  In 1957 further funds were designated to construct a dormitory for male employees.[1]
Since 1981, it has been home to the West Virginia Veterans Home, a facility reserved specifically for veterans in need of a convenient and comfortable home. It is designed for individuals who are ambulatory and independent in all activities of daily living. It can house 150 veterans at full capacity and is operated by a staff of approximately 50 employees.

West Virginia,Denmar Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Denmar_Sanitarium,1917,,1919,Active,Cottage Plan,,West Virginia Colored Tuberculosis Sanitarium | Denmar Correctional Center (current),"February 16, 1917, the legislature approved the establishment of a similar facility for African Americans. The West Virginia Board of Control purchased 185 acres of land and several buildings at Denmar in Pocahontas County from the Maryland Lumber Company. Denmar was chosen for it's high altitudes, which were beneficial to those with lung diseases. In January 1919, the West Virginia Colored Tuberculosis Sanitarium at Denmar admitted its first patients. However, the hospital accepted only those who could pay for their own care, creating hardships for many tuberculosis sufferers. Some patients arrived at the sanitariums by order of city or county governments, which were trying to contain the disease. The West Virginia Penitentiary also sent prisoners to the sanitariums to avoid infecting other inmates.
The number of patients at Denmar grew quickly and forced the state to add children's dormitories and a school . To alleviate overcrowding, the legislature funded a new building in 1937. Medical science gradually developed more effective means to diagnose and treat tuberculosis. In 1957, the state converted Denmar to a hospital for the chronically ill and moved the remaining tuberculosis patients to the newly integrated Hopemont facility. Between 1960 and 1961 Denmar saw it's population nearly double from 100 to 180.  In 1965, the Hopemont Sanitarium also became a hospital for the chronically ill but continued to admit tuberculosis patients.
The Denmar State Hospital closed in 1990 and was converted to a correctional facility in 1993. During the 1993 session of the West Virginia Legislature, funds were appropriated to the Division of Corrections for renovation and occupation of the facility now known as Denmar Correctional Center. In December 1998, the Regional Jail Authority provided funding for a building project at Denmar. The project included a Multi-Purpose Building, a Correctional Industries/Vocational Building and a new roof for the Greenbrier Birthing Center. The building project was completed in January of 2000.[1]",1990,"Denmar, WV",,180 (1961 pop.)
West Virginia,Hopemont State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Hopemont_State_Hospital,1911,,1913,Active,Cottage Plan,,West Virginia State Tuberculosis Sanitarium  | Hopemont Sanitarium,"Hopemont is an unincorporated community in Preston County, West Virginia, United States. It is located to the east of Terra Alta and is the home of Hopemont State Hospital, originally created as the West Virginia State Tuberculosis Sanitarium, Hopemont accepted all ages of white Tuberculosis sufferers. According to the Geographic Names Information System, Hopemont has also been known as Rinards Crossing. Originally built to care for the state's citizens with tuberculosis. Hopemont has operated as a Medicaid certified long-term nursing facility since 1987.
The 600 acre tract owned by the state hospital provided land for the farm operated by many southern institutions into the 1970s.  In addition to four wards in the main hospital itself, Hopemont was also home to the Conley Hospital for maximum security inmates suffering from tuberculosis.  Two of the wards were set aside for children, with a capacity of fifty each and a qualified teacher to continue courses to the secondary level.
Today Hopemont Hospital provides services to geriatric residents of West Virginia requiring long-term care and behavioral interventions to maximize their functioning ability and independence, enabling them to become successful and satisfied in their environment. Hopemont, through lease space agreements, provides operation areas to Valley Community Mental Health for a Day Treatment Unit for Adults and United Summit Center for the John D. Good substance abuse unit.

In 1995 Warden Stephen Yardley and his staff at the Denmar Correctional Center compiled a list of 277 names of sanitarium patients believed to be buried on site. William P. McNeel and members of the Pocahontas County Historical Society scoured the county death records from 1923 to 1946 and made many corrections and additions to the original list. Staff at the West Virginia State Archives conducted a search of the state death records from 1919 to 1946 and discovered several hundred names that did not appear in either hospital or county records.

West Virginia,Huntington State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Huntington_State_Hospital,,1897,1901,Active,Cottage Plan,,Home for Incurables | West Virginia Asylum | Huntington Hospital | Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital,"Huntington Hospital was created by an act of the legislature in 1897, making it the second oldest hospital in the State of West Virginia. When established, it was called the Home for Incurables; this was later changed to the Huntington State Hospital. On October 2, 1999, the name of the hospital was again changed to the Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital.
In the 1950's, the hospital had a mixed population with a census of nearly 1,800; approximately one-third were developmentally disabled, and one-third were geriatric. The Hospital has gradually reduced its inpatient population; this reflects the national movement towards deinstitutionalization and community based pro- grams. This effort was greatly enhanced by the attention generated for mental health services through a class action suit resulting in the Hartley Consent Degree. In 1977, a complete reorganization of the hospital began with emphasis on specialization of direct care services. In 1978, an affiliation agreement was signed with the Marshall University School of Medicine - the first step toward developing Huntington Hospital's potential to become a teaching institution.
In 1988, this hospital became the first (state-operated) psychiatric hospital in West Virginia to be accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
In February 1990, the effort to reduce inpatient beds was completed with the closure of the units in Building 3 where long-term mentally ill patients were hospitalized. From this point, the hospital became a 90-bed facility.
In December 1990, initial certification for the hospital with the Health Care Financing Authority was granted.
The hospital has provided treatment, education and referral services for dually diagnosed mentally ill substance abuse patients (MICA) since January 1997.

West Virginia,Lakin State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Lakin_State_Hospital,1919,,1926,Closed,Rambling Plan,,Lakin State Hospital for the Colored Insane | Lakin Hospital (1970) | Lakin Hospital Nursing Home,"Founded by an act of the West Virginia Legislature in 1919, Lakin Hospital opened its doors on Feb. 1, 1926, with a purpose of, “the reception and treatment of blacks suffering from mental and nervous disorders.” The Lakin State Hospital was created under the same legislation proposed by T.G. Nutter, Harry Capehart and T.J. Coleman, three African American legislators that created several state-funded reform institutions for African Americans between 1919 and 1921, that also created the Lakin Industrial Home for Colored Boys across WV 62 from the hospital. The hospital, then named the ‘Lakin State Hospital for the Colored Insane,’ served patients from across the state. Although the institution’s original name reflected the era of segregation, it was a nontraditional facility with an all black staff, including administrators, and was one of what is believed to be only two all black mental health facilities east of the Mississippi River.
In 1950, Lakin was visited along with the Huntington State Hospital and Spencer State Hospital by Dr. William Freeman, sometimes called the ""Father of the American Lobotomy"".  During July and early August Dr. Freeman performed 228 lobotomies on patients at those facilities, including twenty 'very dangerous Negroes' at Lakin.[1]
In 1954, Lakin State Hospital began the process of integrating it's staff and patient population.  It also assumed the duty of district hospital for Jackson, Mason, Putnam, and Wood counties in West Virginia.  In 1960 the facilities consisted of two three story main buildings (separated by gender), a two story office building, cannery, a new office/dietary complex constructed in 1959, two staff dormitories, physician housing, and a short term treatment medical center.  Along with those buildings, there were six older buildings that had been renovated structures serving as laundry, workshops, and recreation hall.  By 1960 psychosurgical procedures were no longer practiced, replaced by group and recreational therapy and psychotherapy.[2]  However, the hospital did still offer electro-convulsive therapy and insulin coma therapy.[3]
It's use  as a mental hospital persisted into the late 1970s, until the State of West Virginia de-institutionalized mental healthcare. [4]  Today the former Lakin State Hospital property is still owned by the Department of Health the Lakin Nursing Home, while many of the older buildings constructed by the state have now been demolished. One of the hospital’s oldest existing buildings is the Office Building which remains on the grounds though it is only used for storage by the nearby Lakin Correctional Facility for Woman. The Office Building, erected around the late-1950’s is said to have housed not only offices but been a place for major and minor surgery and private pay patients. The Dietary Building which sits behind the Office Building was erected in 1958 and is still in use.[5]
In modern times, the state hospital is frequently confused with the Lakin Industrial Home for Colored Boys.  Proximity and similar names mean casual observers often mistook the abandoned Industrial Home building for being the state hospital.  Matters are not helped since after the School's closing in 1955 the State Hospital took over the grounds in 1957, using the structures as employee housing, post office, and gymnasium.[6]

West Virginia,Spencer State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Spencer_State_Hospital,,1893,,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,,West Virginia Second Hospital for Insane,"In 1885, the state legislature began hearings on the need for a Second Hospital for the Insane. The first hospital for the insane was built at Weston in 1859. Because of overcrowded conditions, it was determined that a second facility was needed. They appointed a commission to choose several sites and present their findings at the next session in 1887. John G Schilling, a Spencer attorney, was among the members of the commission.
One of the factors that would determine the final selection of a site was the willingness of the county government to purchase the necessary land and donate it to the state free of charge. Roane County was enthusiastic with the prospect of obtaining the hospital. The Roane County Court immediately issued an order stating that they would indeed be willing to meet this requirement.
The decision on the hospital's location was not made until the legislative session of 1887. Spencer was eventually chosen as the site of the new hospital. The legislature approved an appropriation of $10,000 to begin construction. The county was now required to provide the land for the facility. On February 10, 1888, the county court purchased 184 acres of land from William R. Goff for the sum of $9,200. Goff, after receiving this large sum of money began looking for a safe repository for his money. Goff and several other citizens joined together to form the Bank of Spencer. It opened for business in March 1891. The county's first bank was designated to handle the funds for the construction of the new hospital. It also later handled the state hospital's regular transactions. The building was 1/4 mile in length. It was sometimes referred to as the longest continuous brick building in America. Bricks for the hospital's Gothic structure were made on the grounds. Native Roane County stone hand cut by Henry Waldeck and Lee Kelley was used for facings and adornments. The slate roof was adorned with cupolas which were typical of the period. The administration building stood four stories high and was topped with two round towers. On each side of the administration building were the two three-story wards, one for men and one for women. The building was completed in 1893 at a total cost of $93,393.
The state's Second Hospital for the Insane was opened on July 18, 1893. At the time of the opening, 54 patients were admitted to the new facility. By 1899 the number of patients had increased to 389 and by 1910 to 696. Some of the disorders patients were admitted for were alcoholic excess, overwork, senility, hereditary insanity, worry, ill health, head injuries, syphilis, epilepsy, paralysis, morphia, cocaine use, cholera, disease of the uterus, pneumonia, bereavement, typhoid fever, tuberculosis and childbed fever.
For the first ten years the open door system was used. No doors were locked and some doors were even removed. This system was considered a success. Even though this open door system was very successful a fence was erected around the hospital to separate the patients from the town. Many of the patients were able to work. They worked in the kitchen, laundry, sewing rooms, lawns, gardens and on the farm. The 15 acres of farm and woodlands were used for grazing of a fine dairy herd, fattening hogs, and raising poultry, as well as, supporting large gardens. The gardens produced enough to feed patients and staff during summer, with extra vegetables and canned goods for the winter.
In the early 1920's the name of the institution was changed to the Spencer State Hospital. In 1937 a five bed hospital clinic was added. By 1941, reports show that over 9,000 persons had been treated there. Many persons without families lived most of their lives in the institution and were buried in unmarked graves. Many of the patients were not mentally ill. Among those were elderly persons and unwanted children. In 1950, a staff of three doctors and 150 psychiatric aides were caring for 1,200 patients.
In the 1950's the number of employees increased. An assistant to the superintendent, social workers, a dietician, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a registered nurse, and a beautician were added. An 85 bed clinic was constructed in 1952. A hospital library, the first and largest in a state institution, was built along with a women's dormitory.
In 1959 the employees began working eight hours a day and they no longer were required to pay a maintenance fee. Before 1959 they worked six days a week, 12 hours a day. They were paid $90 a month, from which a $50 maintenance fee for room, board, and uniforms were deducted, whether the employee lived on or off the grounds. About 1959, workers began to replace the structure's original slate roof with its cupolas and other ornaments with a flat roof. This radically altered the appearance of the hospital. The administration building was torn down and replaced with a modern administration and food service complex between 1973 and 1976. This also changed the view of the hospital greatly.
Spencer State Hospital's function had become provision of custodial care rather than serving its patients as a therapeutic treatment center. This situation would prove to be the seed of the facility's eventual destruction. For more than 30 years attempts were made to free the hospital to fulfill a treatment mission again. All attempts failed. Spencer State Hospital's late years saw the citizens of Roane County united in a battle to save the hospital, much as they united to bring the hospital to Roane County nearly a hundred years ago. In June 1989, the closure of Spencer State Hospital came quietly and an important chapter in the history of Roane County came to an end. The townspeople can no longer depend on the State Hospital whistle to remind them of lunch time and the end of the day. For the whistle is also silent.

West Virginia,Weston State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Weston_State_Hospital,,"March 22, 1858","October 22, 1859",Preserved,Kirkbride Plan,Richard Snowden Andrews,Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum | West Virginia Hospital for the Insane,"From a 1916 Report by Henry Hurd:[1]
This was West Virginia's first public institution. Its construction was begun by the State of Virginia before the separation of West Virginia from the mother state, the first appropriation having been made by the Legislature of Virginia, March 22, 1858. The institution was opened October 22, 1859, when nine patients were brought from Ohio, where they had been in temporary care awaiting the completion of the hospital. Dr. R. Hills, formerly of the Central Ohio Insane Asylum, was made superintendent and Dr. N. B. Barnes, assistant.
In the first years of its history the institution was encompassed with many difficulties. Not only were there financial troubles, but Confederate soldiers in a raid appropriated the blankets belonging to the patients, and in a second raid a ward was destroyed. The people of Weston very generously came to the rescue and contributed their own blankets to fill the temporary needs, public acknowledgment of which was made by the superintendent in his report. In 1868 the population of the hospital was 40; since that date there has been a continual increase in the number of inmates, and a corresponding increase in the appropriation for running expenses, until at the present time the population of the institution is 1023.
The grounds belonging to the hospital contain about 335 acres, and front about 2000 feet on the West Fork River, opposite the town of Weston, and extend back to the north to a depth sufficient for this acreage. With the exception of the site on which the buildings are located, which extends back from the river about 800 feet, the land is very steep and entirely unsuitable for tillage. A very small portion of it is used for gardening, but in the main it is used for grazing.
There are two producing gas wells upon the property, supplying abundant gas for all the needs of the institution, which were discovered in an effort to secure water by boring deep wells. The water supply is something of a problem with this institution, because the only source of supply is the West Fork River. The recent erection of a very large reservoir upon a high point of the hill in the rear of the building has solved the question of storage. So much filtering is needed, however, that it is difficult to get the water entirely free from sediment. There are some shallow drilled wells upon the premises, which are of considerable value in times of drought.
The general hospital building consists of a central portion—the administration building with wings extending on either side north and south. The corridors connect all the wards with each other and with the central building. The main building, erected of native blue sandstone, is 1290 feet in length and 125 feet deep. The auxiliary buildings are of brick and are located in the rear of the main buildings.

In the rear of the main building are:
1. The Atkinson Building, erected in 1897, three stories in height, containing three wards, all used for male patients.
2. A three-story brick building, containing two wards, one for male colored patients, the other for female colored patients.
3. A laundry building, occupied by the laundry, with a plumbing shop and power plant in the basement.
4. An electric power house, a one-story brick building, containing the electric light machinery, ice plant and three cold storage rooms.
5. A patients' kitchen, 45 by 75 feet, equipped with the necessary outfit for the cooking, which must be done on a large scale for such an institution.
6. A sick patients' kitchen.
7. A bake shop, a one-story brick building, containing oven, dough mixer, engine and other necessary utensils.
8. A store room, a two-story brick building, the lower floor containing the main store room, clothes-cutting room and sewing room; the upper floor is used as an attendants' dining room, with kitchen attached. This building is in bad condition.
9. A morgue; the morgue is a stone building for the reception of the bodies of patients dying in the house.
10. A hose house; a small frame building containing all the hose and fire fighting apparatus.
11. Greenhouses
12. Barn; this is a frame structure; part of it is used for horses and the remainder for cows.


From Wikipedia:[2]
The hospital was authorized by the Virginia General Assembly in the early 1850s as the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. Following consultations with Thomas Story Kirkbride, then-superintendent of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, a building in the Kirkbride Plan was designed in the Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles by Richard Snowden Andrews (1830-1903), an architect from Baltimore whose other commissions included the Maryland Governor's residence in Annapolis and the south wing of the U.S. Treasury building in Washington. Construction on the site, along the West Fork River opposite downtown Weston, began in late 1858. Work was initially conducted by prison laborers; a local newspaper in November of that year noted ""seven convict negroes"" as the first arrivals for work on the project. Skilled stonemasons were later brought in from Germany and Ireland.
Construction was interrupted by the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Following its secession from the United States, the government of Virginia demanded the return of the hospital's unused construction funds for its defense; before this could occur, the 7th Ohio Volunteer Infantry seized the money from a local bank, delivering it to Wheeling, where it was put toward the establishment of the Reorganized Government of Virginia, which sided with the northern states during the war. The Reorganized Government appropriated money to resume construction in 1862; following the admission of West Virginia as a U.S. state in 1863, the hospital was renamed the West Virginia Hospital for the Insane. The first patients were admitted in October 1864, but construction continued into 1881. The 200-foot (61 m) central clock tower was completed in 1871, and separate rooms for black people were completed in 1873. The hospital was intended to be self-sufficient, and a farm, dairy, waterworks, and cemetery were located on its grounds, which ultimately reached 666 acres (266 ha) in area. A gas well was drilled on the grounds in 1902. Its name was again changed to Weston State Hospital in 1913.
Originally designed to house 250 patients in solitude, the hospital held 717 patients by 1880; 1,661 in 1938; over 1,800 in 1949; and, at its peak, 2,400 in the 1950s in overcrowded conditions. A 1938 report by a survey committee organized by a group of North American medical organizations found that the hospital housed ""epileptics, alcoholics, drug addicts and non-educable mental defectives"" among its population. A series of reports by The Charleston Gazette in 1949 found poor sanitation and insufficient furniture, lighting, and heating in much of the complex, while one wing, which had been rebuilt using Works Progress Administration funds following a 1935 fire started by a patient, was comparatively luxurious.
By the 1980s, the hospital had a reduced population due to changes in the treatment of mental illness. In 1986, then-Governor Arch Moore announced plans to build a new psychiatric facility elsewhere in the state and convert the Weston hospital to a prison. Ultimately the new facility, the William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital, was built in Weston and the old Weston State Hospital was simply closed, in May 1994. The building and its grounds have since been mostly vacant, aside from local events such as fairs, church revivals, and tours. In 1999, all four floors of the interior of the building were damaged by several city and county police officers playing paintball, three of whom were dismissed over the incident.
Efforts toward adaptive reuse of the building have included proposals to convert the building into a Civil War Museum and a hotel and golf course complex. A non-profit 501(c)3 organization, the Weston Hospital Revitalization Committee, was formed in 2000 for the purpose of aiding in preservation of the building and finding appropriate tenants. Three small museums devoted to military history, toys, and mental health were opened on the first floor of the building in 2004, but were soon forced to close due to fire code violations.
The hospital was auctioned by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources on August 29, 2007. Joe Jordan, an asbestos demolition contractor from Morgantown, was the high bidder and paid $1.5 million for the 242,000-square-foot (22,500 m2) building. Bidding started at $500,000. Joe Jordan has also begun maintenance projects on the former hospital grounds. In October 2007,a Fall Fest was held at the Weston State Hospital. Guided daytime tours were offered as well as a haunted hospital tour at night, a haunted hayride and a treasure hunt starting on the hospital front porch. Family hayrides, arts and crafts and local music were also offered.

This led to several structures being constructed west of WV 62 in rural Mason county. It lies just north of Lakin State Hospital. The familiar red brick building, built in 1924, was constructed of fireproof materials and is very sturdy, was the first building to be erected. A gymnasium was built in the 1940's; several smaller structures followed soon after.
The Lakin Industrial School closed in 1956, only two years after the Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas decision that led to the gradual desegregation of many public schools and colleges in West Virginia. Those who remained before its closure were transferred to the Industrial School at Pruntytown.
It was owned by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services, the same owners of Lakin State Hospital across the state road that slides between the two.

Females were housed at the Industrial Home for Girls in Salem.
For generations of West Virginia youth, the name Pruntytown was synonymous with reform school. A court could commit a boy to Pruntytown, or parents could commit a boy whom they felt was out of their control by getting a judge or magistrate to issue an order. Boys as young as six to eight years old were once housed in the facility. In 1914, the legislature established a minimum age of 10. Originally stressing a military-style discipline, a program evolved that emphasized education, training, and farm work. By 1917, eight years of education were offered, providing a full grade-school education. Previously, the institution had offered schooling up to the fourth grade.
As racial segregation became more prevalent, the State Industrial School for Colored Boys opened at Lakin, Mason County, in 1922, and all of the black boys from Pruntytown were moved there. The Lakin school also served to ease overcrowding at Pruntytown, where the population had increased to more than 400. In 1956, Pruntytown was reintegrated when Lakin closed. A forestry camp at Davis also opened, with boys from Lakin and Pruntytown.
The philosophy of youth incarceration began changing in the 1970s. In West Virginia, decisions by the Supreme Court and the legislature stopped the commitment of children who had not committed specific crimes. As a result, the population declined from 250 in the 1970s to 52 boys who were transferred to the Industrial Home for Youth in Salem when Pruntytown closed.
The facility reopened in 1985, housing minimum custody adult male inmates whose primary work function was to renovate the center. Today, Pruntytown Correctional Center emphasizes work assignments and educational opportunities. Many of the inmates work off-grounds for other state and municipal agencies such as the Division of Highways and the city of Clarksburg.
The center was run as a coed facility from 1988 until 2007 when all females were transferred to the Lakin Correctional Center in Mason County. [1]",1983 (as a juvenile facility),"Grafton, WV",,

West Virginia,Ohio County Tuberculosis Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Ohio_County_Tuberculosis_Sanitarium,1922,,1928,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Roney's Point Sanitarium | Roney's Point Tuberculosis Hospital | Ohio County Poor Farm,"On March 16, 1922, a survey of Tuberculosis in Ohio County began. This survey was a joint venture between numerous organizations whose main goal was combating Tuberculosis. It was conducted under the direction of the WV State Board of Health with the cooperation of the following agencies; United States Public Health Service, West Virginia Tuberculosis Association, Ohio County Medical Society, Wheeling and Ohio County Health Departments, Ohio County Tuberculosis League, Women's Club of Wheeling, and the Wheeling Chamber of Commerce. The plan of the survey was to get in touch with every known case of Tuberculosis and establish clinics for the discovery of more cases. The total number of cases reported during the survey was 1316. Of this number, 240 were found to be active cases, 44 were inactive, 332 were suspect and 30 died. The rest were either negative or surveyors were unable to locate.
The 1928 ""Christmas Seal"" money was used to help the county commission open a 14 bed, fully equipped sanitarium on the Ohio County farm which was located on Battle Run. This original Battle Run site was operated until 1934, when need for a larger facility and the means to obtain one became available. At this time the building which housed the sanitarium was turned over to the Fresh Air Farm, to be used as a summer camp for poor children and for the children of those suffering with Tuberculosis.
In September of 1936, a 40-bed sanatorium was opened on the county farm location. The cost of the institution was $188,000. It was financed in part by the Anti-Tuberculosis League, Federal WPA and funds provided by the county. In October of 1942, a fund was started by Mrs. J. D. Merriman in memory of her husband to build a Nurses' Residence at the Roneys Point Sanitarium. The league added $3,010.00 to the project in February 1943, but the project was abandoned in November 1943 due to insufficient funds.
From September 1944 to June 1945 the League supplemented the salaries of persons working at the sanitarium. The supplement was 10 percent of their monthly salaries. If the League had not done this the sanitarium would have closed, as the county did not have the money to give pay raises. The league also subsidized the cost of patients staying at the sanitarium until 1948. Over the years the League bought and maintained equipment and provided supplies for the sanitarium. Clothing for the patients was provided and milk was purchased to be delivered to the homes of persons suffering from Tuberculosis to help prevent their children from contracting the disease.
On April 10, 1951, the name of the organization was changed to the Tuberculosis Association of Ohio County. The change in name reflected the changes that were occurring in the treatment and control of Tuberculosis. As the war against Tuberculosis waged on, other drugs were being used to help those suffering with this formerly fatal disease. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide were being used on strains that were now resistant to streptomycin. The TB Patch Test became available as a screening mechanism in 1952 and was provided by the Association for all Ohio County school children. Ohio County ranking 9th in population state wide, had the lowest death rate from Tuberculosis of any of the 13 largest counties. The rate was 8.4 deaths per 100,000 population, while the rate in West Virginia was 16.0, and in the United States, 16.1.
Ohio County stopped operating the poor farm in 1962 and abandon the estate in the mid 1960's. The County sold the property to the State of West Virginia in 1967 at this time the state built a hospital that served as a drug and alcohol, mental behavior treatment center and later a boys and girls detention hall. This building closed in the 1970's and the property transferred back to Ohio County.
The County Farm Cemetery was established in 1932, and it is no longer active.",1972,"Roney's Point, WV",,
West Virginia,Pinecrest Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pinecrest_Sanitarium,1927,,1930,Active,Single Building,,Rutherford Sanitarium | Jackie Withrow Hospital,"Pinecrest Hospital was authorized by an Act of the Legislature in 1927 and opened in March of 1930 as a Tuberculosis Sanitarium. Pinecrest had its highest enrollment of TB patients in March of 1953, at which time there was a 655 bed capacity with 631 patients and a waiting list of 81 patients. Due to the advancement of medical technology, in-patient treatment of TB has decreased and we currently have a TB unit with a capacity to treat 5 patients. In December of 1970, Pinecrest initiated the transition from TB to long-term care for the elderly, but the standard of care yet remains to this day. Currently, the facility has a 144 bed capacity.
On November 4th, 2009, the facility changed it's name to honor the late delegate from Raleigh County, Jackie Withrow, officially becoming Jackie Withrow Hospital.  W. W. ""Jackie"" Withrow was first elected to the House of Delegates in 1960, becoming the first woman to serve in this branch of state government.  For 18 years, she was an advocate for the people of West Virginia, quickly holding state government accountable when it was felt the needs of the people were not being met.  She felt it necessary to visit state health and social service institutions and would call attention, popular or not, to the maltreatment of patients in these facilities.
Upon her retirement from her seat in the House in 1978, she was honored by all of her peers for the legacy she left behind.  Never forgetting her calling, she continued to volunteer at the Beckley VA Medical Center where she was awarded the Distinguished Volunteer Award from President Reagan.  Jackie Withrow passed away on November 11th, 2010 at the age of 92.  In the minds of most, it was only fitting that a facility that provides comfort and security to those in need of it is named after such a fine and distinguished West Virginian.
In the 1970s, it was converted to a long-term care hospital but currently serves only 84 patients, far below the 655 it was intended to treat for tuberculosis. Jackie Withrow Hospital accepts referrals for Nursing care patients from hospitals, physicians, other nursing facilities and individuals.",,"Beckley, WV",,
