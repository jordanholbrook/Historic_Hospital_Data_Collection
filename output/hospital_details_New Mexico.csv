New Mexico,Fort Bayard State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fort_Bayard_State_Hospital,,,1899,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Fort Bayard Army Sanatorium | United States Veterans' Hospital No. 55,"Fort Bayard was established in 1866. The fort served as home to Indian scouts and Buffalo Soldiers and played a key role during the Apache Wars. The post was decommissioned in 1900, but Army Surgeon General George M. Sternberg, noting the good health enjoyed by Fort Bayard troops, successfully worked to maintain the post as an Army hospital – primarily for tuberculosis patients.
Not long after, in 1922, the site was transferred to the Veterans Administration, where it continued to treat tuberculosis patients. The large hospital—the one slated for demolition—was built at that time.During the 1930s, many Civilian Conservation Corps boys were brought to the hospital to be treated for minor afflictions. Fort Bayard gained new buildings and landscaping as part of New Deal work relief projects. With the exception of four relatively minor contemporary buildings, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects would complete the built environment and cultural landscape that characterizes much of the historic district today.
Between 1943 and 1945, while treatment for TB continued, as many as 100 German prisoners of war were brought to the fort from the large POW camp near Lordsburg. Housed in a building north of the hospital and guarded by two platoons of soldiers, they were assigned jobs that were left vacant by men who had been called to duty overseas. Fort Bayard became a state hospital and long-term care facility in 1965. But in 2010, patients were transferred to the modern Fort Bayard Medical Center, just outside the post, and the fort itself was left empty.",2010,"Santa Clara, NM",Mission Revival,
New Mexico,New Mexico State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=New_Mexico_State_Hospital,,1889,1893,Active,Cottage Plan,,Territorial Insane Asylum | Insane Asylum of New Mexico | New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute | Las Vegas Medical Center,"This facility was established in 1889. They admitted their first patient in 1893 in a modest three story building. The original building which housed the Insane Asylum was completed on March 1, 1892, at a cost of $34,250. A year later the hospital was sufficiently staffed to open its doors for the care and treatment of mentally ill persons from throughout New Mexico. It was expanded because of the growing need for patient care. By 1935, the hospital was treating 750 patients. The term ""mistreating"", is more accurate as applied to treating mental patients during that era, because of the general medical ignorance about mental illness and disorders. Only recently, has mental illness been considered a disease like any other disease. In 1970 the name was changed to the Las Vegas Medical Center, and in 2005 it became the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute.
The New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute is the only state owned and operated psychiatric hospital in New Mexico. NMBHI is made up of five clinical divisions serving a wide range of public needs. Each division is separately licensed and has its own unique admission criteria. The most familiar is the inpatient care to adult psychiatric patients. They provide adult psychiatric services on six units, serving approximately 1000 admissions per year. The adolescent program is dedicated to treating adolescent sex offenders. The forensic division offers competency evaluation and treatment for adult patients who have allegedly committed a felony.

Three cemetery sections are on the Hospital facility: Cemetery A, Cemetery B, and Cemetery C. A nearby cemetery, not associated with the hospital, is the Mount Calvary Cemetery which is located 100 feet north of the the access road. The hospital burials historically had graves marked with metal or concrete. It does not appear to be used any longer & the number of graves is unknown. Names of those buried are listed  HERE",,"Las Vegas, NM",,
New Mexico,Albuquerque Indian School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Albuquerque_Indian_School,,1881,1881,,,,,"The Presbyterian Church started the Albuquerque Indian School in rented quarters in 1881 under contract with the federal government in the town of Duranes NM. In 1886, a businessmen contributed acreage at what is today 12th Street and Indian School Road in Albuquerque, and the school was reloacted to its permanent location. The new campus expanded until it comprised forty-eight buildings, eventually including even a hospital where kids who contracted the ubiquitous scourge, tuberculosis and other diseases recuperated or sometimes died.
Here, children lived, learned, were deprived of their indigenous cultures, and often yearned for home. Art education at the Albuquerque Indian School, particularly drawing, existed since the establishment of that institution under the management of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in 1881. A teacher, for example, told the Albuquerque Journal in 1883 that  “the school hours are from 9 to 12 in the forenoon, 2 to 5 in the afternoon and one hour after supper devoted to music and drawing” and that “reading, arithmetic, writing, drawing, spelling, geography, and lessons in the use of language are daily taught”.
After 1900 drawing seems to have lost its importance in the curriculum in favor of more systematic attention to industrial work. The 1900 annual report of Superintendent Collins to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs actually confirms that “most time is given over to practical and useful work. Only enough attention is given to music and so-called accomplishments to serve as a diversion.”
Native crafts were included in the curriculum of the Albuquerque Indian School as a result of the 1901 Uniform Course of Study introduced by Estelle Reel. In his 1904 annual report Superintendent Allen wrote that “pottery work among the Pueblo girls was very good” and that “many of the girls who had been taught weaving were so anxious to weave blankets that they frequently used the legs of an ordinary chair for a loom.” Native children were clearly yearning for whatever semblance of their culture they could be allowed to hold on to. However, the introduction of Navajo weaving as a minor part of the domestic training of girls clearly shows that the purpose of this training was not the preservation of the craft or the promotion of an aspect of native culture, but rather the development of girls’ skills in the making of utilitarian objects, that is, items that were useful and economically valuable. Girls could have thus spent their free time in making good objects that could have been sold.
When Estelle Reel retired in 1910 and the new schools supervisor took office, emphasis on Native industries strongly decreased as the 1916 course of study for Native schools demonstrates: domestic science and manual training were retained as core teachings. Through a complex process of parental involvement, Pueblo culture, and legal challenges, this particular institution changed over time to become a school where young people could gain an identity, learn English while practicing their own arts, be athletes, play in a renowned band, work in Albuquerque homes, and graduate with the same fond memories as children hold for any school. The Pueblo tribe currently holds the land in trust. In the same location is now the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, built in 2013.",,"Albuquerque, NM",,
