Arkansas,Arkansas State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Arkansas_State_Hospital,1873,1881,,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),,"Arkansas Insane Asylum, | Arkansas Lunatic Asylum, | Arkansas State Hospital for Nervous Diseases","The Arkansas State Hospital is the only state-owned and -operated facility for the treatment of mental illness in Arkansas. The structure, function, and name of this facility have changed with the development of new technology and more progressive views for treating individuals suffering from mental illness, epilepsy, birth defects, learning disabilities, and the effects of old age.
The Arkansas Lunatic Asylum was created by legislative act in 1873. In 1905, the name was changed to Arkansas State Hospital for Nervous Diseases; it was changed to Arkansas State Hospital in 1933. A facility known as the State Hospital still exists today, but what was historically encompassed by the “State Hospital” is now part of the Division of Behavioral Health Services of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, though many people still refer to it as the State Hospital
In 1873, $50,000 was appropriated by the state legislature for the purchase and construction of a facility for the care and treatment of the mentally ill in Arkansas. The purchase of a plot of land west of Little Rock (Pulaski County) took most of the original appropriation. The site of the original hospital is where the present day offices of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission are which is just north of Markham Avenue and near I-430. The Brooks-Baxter War of 1872 and political wrangling about the planned location of the facility delayed any further action until 1881.
In 1881, the legislature levied a one-mill tax on all property in the state for two years and created an appropriation of $150,000 for the construction, outfitting, and operation of the asylum.
The asylum opened officially on March 1, 1883, with Dr. Chastaine Caldwell Forbes as superintendent. The first patient had actually been admitted by legislative order a few days earlier. Over the next few decades, a pattern of overcrowding and expansion emerged. As the available space was filled, the legislature was convinced to provide for the construction of additional facilities. By 1915, there were twelve buildings housing patients at the Little Rock site. In the 1930s, a hospital farm was established at Baucum (Pulaski County), where some of the more physically able patients were employed in the operation of a dairy farm. There were about 100 inmates to start with at the farm. By 1936, the need for further expansion prompted the opening of the Benton Farm Colony, as it was then called. It was planned to hold about 2,000 patients. With the opening of the Benton Unit of the State Hospital (BUSH), a geographical plan for admissions was made. The Arkansas River was the divider, those from north of the river were admitted to the hospital in Little Rock while those from south of the river were admitted to the Benton unit In 1957, due to changes in what was thought appropriate in the care of the inmates, the legislature ordered the cessation of all farm operations.
After almost eighty years, many of the original buildings were becoming dilapidated, and there were calls to replace the structures. In 1960, $6 million was appropriated for the renewal of the Little Rock facilities, and then in 1964, a federal grant of $291,950 was acquired for the updating of the Benton Unit. The Little Rock facility, in use as part of the Division of Behavioral Health Services, was replaced in 2008 with a 130-bed, 152,000-square-foot building adjacent to the campus of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The old facility was replaced after mental health advocates complained about it being inadequate for the proper treatment of the mentally ill although the Forensics Unit remains at the site. UAMS bought the land and has since built a dorm on the site. The Little Rock Community Mental Health Center at one time was part of the State Hospital and was known then as The Greater Little Rock Ommunity Mental Health Center before becoming private, not for profit in 1993. Pulaski County Circuit Court has a courtroom on the grounds by LRCMHC and the Forensics Unit which is used for all civil committment hearings and 911 proceedings. In the late 1960's the state opened George W. Jackson Community Mental Health Center in Jonesboro which provided hosptization for patients in northeast area of the state as well as outpatient care for the region. In 1993 Midsouth Health Systems was incorporated and chartered by the state to take over as the CMHC for George W Jackson.
Many great Arkansans contributed to the advancement of this institution. The Honorable Hiram Marion McVeigh? drafted the original legislation that created the Arkansas Insane Asylum. Chastaine Forbes was the first superintendent, and Dr. Philo Hooper served as an original board member from 1881 to 1893 and as superintendent from 1896 to 1901. His own wife later became an inmate of the hospital. Dr. Elizabeth Fletcher became the first female physician at the hospital in 1936 and spearheaded much advancement in the care of mentally disabled children.
For many years, this was the only facility in Arkansas for dealing with people who, in modern times, would be sent to nursing homes, special schools, and rehab centers. Advancements in the medical community’s knowledge about vaccinations, prenatal care, and pharmaceutical treatments have caused the Arkansas State Hospital to change and develop. The hospital now maintains more of a focus on the treatment of the mentally ill, with the plan to get them back into society. Instead of a warehouse for people who are mentally unable to care for themselves, the citizens of Arkansas have state-of-the-art facilities to treat and possibly cure a wide range of mental illness.

Arkansas,Benton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Benton_State_Hospital,,1931,,Active,Cottage Plan,,"Benton Farm Colony, | Benton Services Center  | Arkansas Health Center","By 1928, Arkansas State Hospital was seriously overcrowded and in 1929 the legislature authorized creation of a new facility. Land for the new unit of the State Hospital was purchased on Highway 67 approximately five miles southwest of Benton. The first buildings were completed in 1931. In 1934, the State secured a WPA loan and the work was completed with 16 buildings ready for occupancy in 1935. The first patient was admitted to the Benton Unit on June 7., 1936. It soon became evident that the 16 dormitories were inadequate and so a 352 bed capacity building (Bldg 67) was completed on October 29, 1947. In April 1951, another new building with 400 ward beds and 60 infirmary beds (Bldg 70) was completed.
The 1957 Legislature authorized the State Hospital to cease all farming operations. The stock, timber, etc., were disposed of and the patients were transferred to Benton. In 1962, a joint rehabilitative project was initiated at the Benton Unit. Building 7 was remodeled to house the project which was designed to screen all State Hospital patients for Rehabilitative potential. The program was started in May 1962 with one building, 8 employees, and 30 chronic patients. In about 1965, Building 18 was completed and the administrative staff of the Rehabilitation Services moved into it.
The 1961 Legislature appropriated $6,000,000 for the construction of new buildings at the Little Rock State Hospital to replace the old buildings. Construction started in 1963. Until that time, all admissions of patients had been to the Little Rock Hospital where they were evaluated. Chronic and elderly patients were transferred to the Benton Unit. Since the new buildings would not have the bed capacity of the old buildings, it was decided to open an admission office at the Benton Unit. The admission office was opened July 1, 1963.
In 1976 a Legislative Committee recommended that the Psychiatric Service at Benton be closed and moved to the Little Rock State Hospital. In preparation for this move on August 30, 1976, all the patients on Building 62 were moved to Building 59. This move combined all the admissions from Southwest Arkansas to Building 59 and all the admissions from Southeast Arkansas to Building 58. This also permitted part of the Medical Staff to be moved to the Little Rock State Hospital to prepare for receiving the Benton Psychiatric facilities.
On September 30, 1977, the last patient on Building 61 was transferred to the Benton Services Center Nursing Home and Building 61 was closed. That officially closed the Psychiatric Service and the Benton Services Center Hospital. In 1981 a new nursing home building was completed.[1]

The Arkansas State Hospital Cemetery in Little Rock dates back to 1882 and has been moved several times. Graves were disinterred and moved to West Little Rock and subsequently disinterred from that location to the Haskell area. A plaque and statue honoring the former patients of ASH remains on the grounds of the new government buildings on Natural Resource Drive in West Little Rock. The current cemetery is comprised of 35 rows, with as many as 45 plots in each row. Based on the Arkansas State Hospital Cemetery Book and Site Survey compiled by Flossie McMurray in the early 1980s, there are well over 1000 individuals buried at Benton #1, some in individual graves and others in group graves ranging from 6 to as many as 30 or more. As of 2010, transport records which occasionally include identification of the deceased and the cemetery and/or institution from which their remains were shipped, exist for a handful of years. Based on the known populations at the Arkansas State Hospital, and myriad families seeking information about their family members who have been documented to have passed away in the institution, many bodies and records remain unaccounted for.",,,,
Arkansas,Arkansas Children's Colony,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Arkansas_Children%27s_Colony,1955,1958,1959,Active,Cottage Plan,,Conway Human Development Center,"Dedicated on October 4, 1959, the Arkansas Children’s Colony was a state-supported center that served Arkansas’s mentally handicapped children. The colony, set on a little over 400 donated acres in Conway (Faulkner County), provided a school and a home away from home for as many as 1,000 developmentally disabled, school age children.
Governor Orval Faubus lobbied strongly for funds to build a facility to serve the state’s mentally challenged children. On January 25, 1955, the Arkansas General Assembly created Act 6, which engendered Arkansas’s first facility to serve such children. Arkansas was the forty-eighth state to open such an institution. A donation of $1,200 was made to the facility, and workers began construction in 1958. Less than two years later, 3,000 people attended the facility’s opening.
The Arkansas Children’s Colony was a full residential facility with numerous cottages, classrooms, a gym, a kitchen, a health clinic, and a chapel. Its central location eventually allowed much of the state to benefit from the services offered.
In the facility’s early days, the cottages housed 256 residents, and by the early 1970s, more cottages had been built to accommodate over 1,000. At one time, the waiting list for the colony numbered 1,800 children.
Sponsoring the facility were the Kiwanis Clubs of Arkansas. Their work helped fund the building of the non-denominational chapel on the grounds in 1968. The Arkansas Federation of Women’s Clubs (AFWC) soon adopted the colony as a special project, raising $18,000, some of which helped purchase playground equipment for the first six cottages. Another part of the funds helped in the building of the chapel on the colony’s grounds, including the stained-glass windows.
Other groups playing key roles were the United Commercial Travelers of Arkansas, the Little Rock (Pulaski County) chapter of the National Association of Railway Business Women, and the Elks Clubs of Arkansas. In addition, the Civitan, Optimist, Rotary, and Lions clubs donated time, money, and necessities.
This children’s compound was greatly needed in Arkansas. Not only did it serve the state’s mentally challenged children, but later it housed ill children. Sufferers of German measles stayed there between the years of 1963 and 1965. Easy isolation was a plus in using the colony for vaccine research. Each cottage housed sixteen patients, and physicians tested the German measles vaccine on many of the children, with their parents’ approval. These young residents proved invaluable to the research, which ushered in common use of the current rubella vaccine.
On the evening of April 10, 1965, a devastating tornado tore a path through Conway. The twister killed six area residents, but none of the colony’s children were harmed. Unfortunately, damage to the children’s living quarters left the displaced youths confused and frightened. Nearby Hendrix College came to the rescue and housed some of the children until their parents arrived.
Eventually, numerous statutes expanded Act 6, and legislation in 1971 broadened the definition of those accepted at the colony to include children with certain physical maladies and disorders that caused the patients to struggle in performing daily routines. These included autism, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy.
In 1981, the Arkansas Children’s Colony was renamed as the Conway Human Development Center (CHDC) and continues under that name. Since the Conway location was a success, five other such human development centers (HDCs) opened around the state. These were located in Arkadelphia (Clark County), Alexander (Pulaski and Saline counties), Jonesboro (Craighead County), Booneville (Logan County), and Warren (Bradley County). The Warren facility was the most recent to open, beginning operations in 1978. The Alexander facility closed in 2011.
By the beginning of the twenty-first century, Arkansas had one of the highest percentages of disabled individuals living in institutions among the fifty states. CHDC director Bob Clark resigned in 2002 after serving more than twenty years in that position. That year, CDHC was troubled by lawsuits from families of residents, by state and federal investigations, and by a series of unfavorable articles in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The institution was accused of neglect and abuse of residents, including lack of proper medical care, improper supervision of residents who were harming other residents, abusive behavior toward residents by staff members, and failure to report a variety of problems. Continued investigations led to a fifty-page report issued by the U.S. government in 2004 in which the center was described as “terribly inadequate” and “grossly deficient.” Attorneys for the federal agencies and for the State of Arkansas began years of meetings seeking to resolve the legal troubles of CHDC. In January 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against the Conway Human Development Center, alleging improper care of the residents. The suit went to trial in September 2010 but was dismissed in early 2011.
The HDCs still offer a residence and provide for habilitative and medical care for qualifying children, but the approximately 500 residents of Conway Human Development Center, as of 2009, are primarily adults. Each of Arkansas’s seventy-five counties benefits from community-based services—some through nonprofit, private programs.",,"Conway, AR",,
Arkansas,Arkansas Boys Industrial School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Arkansas_Boys_Industrial_School,1905,,1917,Preserved,Single Building,,Boys Industrial School of the State of Arkansas | Arkansas Boys' Reform School | Pine Bluff Youth Services Center | Arkansas Training School for Boys,"On April 25, 1905, Governor Davis approved an act providing for the establishment of a “State Reform School, for the discipline, education, employment and reformation of convicts under the age of eighteen years.”  Act 199 provided for white and black students, both male and female, housed in separate quarters.  This first reform school was located approximately ten miles west of what were then the Little Rock city limits.  Because the location was difficult for farming and sited in dense timber growth, this initial location proved unsatisfactory.  In 1915 Julia Houston, the first probation officer from Pine Bluff, presented a bill to have the students moved.  At first the proposal was vetoed, but later it was approved by Governor Brough.  In 1917, Act 67 of the legislature changed the name of the institution to “Boys Industrial School of the State of Arkansas.”  The governor appointed a board whose first responsibility was to acquire a new site.
Captain Geisreiter of Pine Bluff donated 160 acres of land and the citizens of Pine Bluff raised $5,466, some of which was used to purchase 80 adjoining acres.  The Act of 1917 provided $5,000 for the purchase of land.  The surplus of this amount was used for a building fund.  Simple cottages were erected and a detachment of boys was sent to the site to begin clearing the land and cultivating.  According to an article in the Graphic, a former Pine Bluff newspaper, on October 26, 1917, the first buildings at the school were temporary frame board and batten structures.  Forty additional acres of land were purchased on April 13, 1918, for $1,400.  This provided the high ground on which to build the new buildings.  In 1919, the legislature appropriated $98,000 for a vast building program and a plan was made for a complex of permanent structures, which included three cottages for boys, a building for the superintendent, a dining hall and a gymnasium.  The administration building was also to serve as the superintendent's residence.
The Legislative Acts of Arkansas, Act 723 of 1923, allocated $125,000 for building expenditures. The Julia Houston Cottage, Tom C. McRae Cottage, a trades building, hospital and additional small cottages were erected.  None of these structures remain. By 1935 the Boys Industrial School consisted of a total of 360 acres, the present size of what is now called the Pine Bluff Youth Services Center.  No major building programs took place until the 1950s.  The Youth Services Center is now a facility for the care and treatment of delinquent youth, males ages 13-18.",1994,"Pine Bluff, AR",,
Arkansas,Arkansas Boys Industrial School for Negroes,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Arkansas_Boys_Industrial_School_for_Negroes,,,1931,Demolished,Single Building,,,"The State of Arkansas established a juvenile correctional facility at Wrightsville in 1931. The facility was dedicated to the housing and instruction of young African-American males. The main building of the facility was built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The school held up to sixty-nine young men between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, all of whom had been convicted of minor infractions. A fire on March 5, 1959, claimed the lives of twenty-one residents of the facility, who were trapped behind locked doors when the fire began. Charley Meadows, a 16-year old night sergeant, broke open one window, allowing for egress. 48 boys managed to escape, while 21 died. The families of the deceased said that authorities told them that 14 of the dead boys were wrapped in newspapers and deposited in an unmarked grave.
A new state correctional facility opened in 1981. The Wrightsville Unit has capacity for 800 inmates. It housed a boot camp program until the program was moved to the Tucker Unit in 2010. The unit raises beef cattle and manufactures furniture, and it is the largest employer in the Wrightsville area. The 3,300-acre unit, formerly outside the city limits, was annexed by the city of Wrightsville in 1998.",1981,"Wrightsville, AR",,

Arkansas,Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanitorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Arkansas_Tuberculosis_Sanitorium,,,1910,Active,Cottage Plan,,Booneville Human Development Center,"At the first semi-annual meeting of the Arkansas Tuberculosis Association in Little Rock on January 26, 1909, the Association deliberated on a “Bill for an Act to provide for the location, erection, organization, management and maintenance of a State Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis in the State of Arkansas…”  The bill had been prepared by Senator Kie Oldham at the urging of Judge Joseph M. Hill.  (Hill had been diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1905, and moved to Arizona as a result.  It was the move to Arizona that convinced him that Arkansas needed its own sanatorium.)  The bill, which was Act 378 of the Legislature, was approved by Governor George Donaghey on May 31, 1909, and appropriated $50,000 for the establishment of a tuberculosis sanatorium and $30,000 for two years of maintenance.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of funds in the treasury for the project, the Board of Trustees had to wait until the following fiscal year to begin work on the facility.
The site chosen for the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium echoed the locations chosen for sanatoria in the eastern U.S., especially around Saranac Lake, New York.  The site was in a mountainous area away from large cities where the air would be fresher, supposedly bringing better relief from the disease.  A pamphlet issued by the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium c.1925 touted the facility’s location by saying:
""The site of the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium near Booneville is a beautiful one, 900 feet above sea level, among the pines, high enough for refreshing breezes in summer and not high enough for the cold fogs of winter; with a bountiful supply of excellent water and perfect drainage.  The climate the year round is unexcelled by any in the South or West, free from the winter’s dampness of the Gulf coast and from the sand storms and enervating heat of the South arid regions, and the blizzards of those farther north.""
However, before construction could begin, two large obstacles had to be overcome – building a road to access the site and securing a supply of water.  A route for the road was selected on December 21, 1909, and a pond was built south of the sanatorium, which was pumped full of water from the Petit Jean River, to provide water.  Construction then began on the buildings that the plans called for, including an administration building, one ward building, two A cottages, two B cottages, five tent houses, four cabins and a superintendent’s cottage. Dr. John Shibley was chosen to serve as the first head of the State Sanatorium, and the first patient was admitted on August 2, 1910, with the formal opening held on September 1, 1910.
The number of patients at the sanatorium quickly increased.  In August 1910, a total of 16 patients were admitted, 27 patients arrived in September, 22 in October, and 19 in November.  It was not long before patients had to be turned away because there was not any room to house and care for them.
However, the problem of the growing number of tuberculosis cases across the state was not felt just at the sanatorium in Booneville.  In Little Rock, for example, tuberculosis was also a problem, according to a 1914 survey.  From 1909 to 1913, Little Rock alone lost an average of 101.6 people to tuberculosis each year (an average of 45.3 whites and 56 blacks).  The report stated that “the State Sanatorium for Incipient Cases at Booneville has a few beds available for cases from Pulaski County.  The County authorities are to be commended for using their full quota of beds at this institution.”
Pulaski County was beginning to take active steps to fight the disease, including the establishment of the Pulaski County Anti-Tuberculosis Society, which was “composed of individuals organized for the purpose of fighting the white plague in Pulaski County.”  The Society was “supported by donations and the proceeds of the Red Cross Seal sale,” and its “activities to date (1914) have consisted of a limited campaign of education, the engaging of a visiting nurse, and plans and preparations for the operating of a free dispensary, which was opened in September 1914.”
The creation of the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium was a reflection of the progressive stance that Arkansas had taken against some of the most prevalent diseases of the period, a stance that was often ahead of many other states.  The earliest buildings built at the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium around the time of its founding consisted of two main types – frame buildings and “tent houses” according to the 1913 Sanborn map.  To the southeast of the driveway were located the Administration Building, Hospital Building, Goldman Pavilion (patient housing), the Superintendent’s Cottage, two Women’s Cottages, and a water tank, all of which were frame, except for the water tank.  Frame construction would have been ideal for the first buildings at the Sanatorium, since they would have been easily constructed and there was an abundance of timber on “The Hill.”
To the northwest of the driveway, were three Men’s Cottages and nine tent houses.  Only one of these buildings, one of the Men’s Cottages labeled “Cottage Sebastian” on the 1913 Sanborn map, was apparently all frame construction.  The rest of the buildings, according to early photographs, had low frame walls with large flaps, hinged at the top, which opened out to provide airflow through the buildings.  The buildings were crowned with gable roofs.  The tent houses would have been easy to construct to allow the sanatorium to be operational in a short amount of time, and they would have also provided as much fresh air as possible to the patients, the latest treatment for tuberculosis.
However, with the increasing number of tuberculosis patients around the state that needed to be served and the wider variety of cases being seen, it soon became apparent that more buildings needed to be built at the sanatorium.  To aid in this the 1913 legislature appropriated $15,000 for a hospital to be built to care for “the far advanced and hemorrhagic cases.”  The building had a capacity of twenty-four patients and was named Kie Oldham Hall after Senator Oldham who had worked tirelessly to get the sanatorium established. In addition to Kie Oldham Hall, $4,000 was appropriated for “a small but satisfactory” laundry so that the laundry would no longer need to be done by hand.
The late 1910s and early 1920s brought additional new construction to the sanatorium, including Echols Hall, a twenty-four bed building costing $5,000, and the gift of Mrs. W. J. Echols of Fort Smith in memory of her husband, and a $21,000 water plant and a $12,000 dairy.  The dairy had an “excellent herd of twenty-one cows” that provided enough milk for the 114 patients living at the sanatorium.  However, the facility was still growing as an average of approximately 400 patients were being accepted each year for treatment.
Because the sanatorium was also seeing an influx of children as patients, Judge Hill proposed to the Belle Point Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons in Fort Smith, on December 10, 1922, at the time of their 75th anniversary celebration, that the Masons build a building at the sanatorium for the care of children.  The Masons accepted the proposal and a twenty-four bed building, which cost approximately $57,000, was built and formally dedicated on September 21, 1924.  Furnishings for the building were also donated by Masonic lodges and Order of the Eastern Star chapters around the state.
The changing treatments for tuberculosis were reflected in the construction of the Kelley Building built in 1927.  The building was originally known as the Occupational Therapy building, and was used for occupational therapy, a form of treatment that came about in full form in the early 1920s.  With occupational therapy, patients who were confined to their beds could also enjoy some activity.  Occupational therapy allowed patients to make things while in bed (i.e., leather-working, knitting, crocheting, or embroidery) to pass the time, releasing built-up tension, or even be able to support themselves. Even though the Kelley Building was a gift to the sanatorium, it was kept secret for almost ten years.
Surprisingly, even though the sanatorium was run by the State of Arkansas, treatment was not free.  The same c.1925 brochure gave the following information on costs.  “The treatment will be strictly up to date and the tables will be supplied with the best the markets of the state afford.  The terms are $10.00 per week.  This pays for lodging, board, medical treatment, nursing and plain laundry.  Bona fide residents of the state suffering from tuberculosis and unable to pay for maintenance may be admitted free on written order of the County Judge of their county, setting forth these facts, in which case a charge of $5.00 per week for one-half the maintenance will be made against the patient’s county.”
Holidays were special occasions for the patients during the 1920s.  At Thanksgiving, for example, “the program for the day began with a Sunrise Service of song and prayer in which patients, staff, and employees joined in offering up thanks to the Creator for the blessings bestowed upon them during the past year.  …Once more the fine Thanksgiving dinner, served in the main dining hall left nothing to be desired.  The hospital and the ambulant buildings sent over all their patients that were able to attend, and plates were laid for 210 patients.  …Last on the day’s program came the picture show – “Ben Hur” – re-booked especially for the occasion by Dr. Stewart.”
Even though additional buildings to accommodate a larger number of patients were built throughout the 1920s, it was not long before overcrowding became an issue again.  The overcrowding at the Booneville facility also caused some counties to put in measures to do some of their own care of tuberculosis patients.  In Craighead County, for example, according to the August 1937 issue of the Sanatorium Outlook, “Craighead County will have 13 Burr Cottages built by the WPA.  Eight will be built on the county farm for patients who are waiting a chance to enter the Sanatorium.”
The WPA’s efforts at Wildcat Mountain greatly aided the fight against tuberculosis in Arkansas by allowing more patients to be adequately served and treated.  However, it was not just the WPA that aided in providing adequate facilities for the sanatorium.  Beginning in 1935, it was the PWA that began to drastically transform the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium campus into the massive facility that is present today.
In August 1935 officials at the sanatorium filed an application with the Arkansas PWA through E. Chester Nelson, an architect in Fort Smith, for $24,300 in grant funds for improvements at the facility.  It was estimated that the total amount needed for the proposed projects would be $54,000, although the sanatorium already had some funding on hand to complete the projects.  According to the Sanatorium Outlook, “Five items are proposed in the application…  The application proposes the construction of an addition to the present office building; a new ice and refrigeration plant and bakery to be attached to the present administration building and the purchase and installation of equipment; construction of a new laundry building; altering of McGehee Hall, and the reconstruction of the Occupational Therapy building, now called the Kelley building, to make it a building to accommodate 18 patients and the necessary equipment.” By the end of 1935, the grant had been received and “bids were opened for construction, and the contract has been given to Cooper Construction Company, of Booneville.”
By the end of 1936, much of the work planned under the initial PWA grant was completed, including the Kelley Building, which was finished by October.According to the Sanatorium Outlook, “the building has two large wards that accommodate nine patients each, separated by serving room, individual lockers, and chart room.” Considering the work began on January 30, 1936, it was completed in a very timely manner.
By early 1938, in order to keep up with the new buildings that had been built, along with new buildings that were being planned, it was determined that improvements needed to be made to the facility’s water supply.  “Work on the project for enlarging the Sanatorium water supply lake began December 9 [1937].  The clearing and cleaning of ground preparatory for the moving of dirt is well under way and the steam shovels for the work are already (Dec. 28) on the grounds.” It did not take long for the improvements to be carried out and by July “finishing touches are being added to the Sanatorium dam, and by the time this appears in print the project will probably be completed.  …According to the present design it will impound approximately 100,000,000 gallons of water, as compared with its previous capacity of about 39,000,000 gallons, when the water reaches spillway level.  …The raising of the dam was done by WPA labor.” The WPA did further infrastructure improvements later in 1938 when “Presidential approval of a …project for hard surfacing three miles of highway inside the Sanatorium grounds has been received.  The road will be laid out according to plans prepared by the State Planning Board in connection with the building and improvement plan.”
During the special session of the 1938 Legislature, Senators Lee Nichols of Booneville and Leo E. Nyberg of Helena, who was himself suffering from tuberculosis, fought for the passage of the Nichols-Nyberg Act, which appropriated $1,200,000 to fund an extensive building program at the sanatorium.  To supplement the appropriation, the PWA awarded the sanatorium a grant of $948,071, which allowed “the sanatorium to complete an extensive building program [that] will give the state the most adequate state tuberculosis institution with regard to facilities and capacities in the United States.”
The architectural firms of Haralson & Mott of Fort Smith and Erhart & Eichenbaum of Little Rock were selected to complete the designs of the buildings (they had actually already been selected for the main hospital building, later named the Leo E. Nyberg Building), and the rendering of the Nyberg Building was proudly displayed in the May 1938 issue of the Sanatorium Outlook.  It was said that the building would have “…523 beds; 115 single rooms and 204 double rooms.  The building will have six stories including ground floor in the central wing and five stories including ground floor in each of the side wings.  The building is to be of modern hospital design and the construction is to consist of reinforced concrete beams, columns and slabs.”
The feverish pace of progress on the new construction continued throughout 1939.  Bids for the construction of the cannery building and the twelve doctors’ cottages were received on May 11, and although the three bids received for the construction of the cottages were rejected, J. H. Leveck of Little Rock was awarded the cannery contract with a bid of $27,900. Construction bids for the nurses’ home and two employees’ dormitories were received June 8, and the cottages were soon back on track with construction being “well under way” by August. In fact, at the June 8, 1939, meeting of the sanatorium board of trustees, contracts totaling $316,267.56 were awarded.
Also by August 1939, “preliminary plans for a new administration building and commons building and a 120-bed building for ambulant patients were approved subject to revision.” The contract for the construction of the administration building was awarded August 17 to the Manhattan Construction Company of Muskogee, Oklahoma, which had the low bid of $35,795, and the contracts for the commons building and the patient’s building (Hamp Williams Building) were awarded on September 22.  The Manhattan Construction Company, with a bid of $157,990, received the contract for the commons building, while the patient’s building was awarded to the Harmon Construction Company of Oklahoma City for $124,831.
By the end of 1939, projects were starting to be completed, an amazing accomplishment considering that construction had begun a little over a year before.  The new power plant was to be ready on October 1, and on December 15, “the board accepted as complete the cannery, power plant, employees’ barracks, guinea pig piggery, and twelve employees’ cottages.” Also, by late 1939, the hospital building was almost complete, and the progress was poetically described in the November 1939 Sanatorium Outlook along with an extensive description of the building’s features.
The dedication ceremonies for the new sanatorium buildings were scheduled for July 4, 1940, with the keynote addresses to be given by Dr. W. A. Doppler, Field Director of Health Education Service of the National Tuberculosis Association and Governor Carl E. Bailey.Dr. J. D. Riley, superintendent of the sanatorium, served as master of ceremonies while the North Little Rock high school band provided musical entertainment.  It was estimated that over 3,000 people attended the ceremonies.
Although Arkansas now had the largest tuberculosis facility in the country, the disease was still a serious force to be reckoned with.  During Dr. Doppler’s address, he indicated that “during the First World War 70,000 Americans were killed and during the same time 100,000 died from tuberculosis.”  In fact, Senator Nyberg, who conceived the idea of the building campaign while a patient at the sanatorium, and for whom the main hospital building was named for, died of the disease before the construction was finished.  Nyberg’s legacy in fighting tuberculosis was eloquently stated by Representative Ernest Maner in a January 15, 1941, address delivered to the House of Representatives.
The scale of the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium was significant for being the largest tuberculosis sanatorium in the United States by the time the PWA buildings were finished in the early 1940s, and it remains the largest extant tuberculosis sanatorium today.  By 1938, the sanatorium had a movie theatre along with its own water supply, and it eventually got its own wastewater treatment plant and heating plant.  A post office (State Sanatorium) was established in 1927 and remained in operation until 1968.  The Commons Building also had a store for the sanatorium’s residents.  A dairy was established by 1926, according to the Sanborn maps, and other farming operations were also in place.  An ice plant was also located in the same building as the kitchen and dining rooms and the administrative area.  The sanatorium also had its own laundry.
Housing was provided for the workers and families, especially after the PWA expansion in 1938-1940, through cottages, apartments, dormitories, and barracks.  The theory was to keep everybody isolated at the sanatorium as much as possible in order to help prevent the spread of the disease beyond the facility’s boundaries.  Frank Ryan notes in his book The Forgotten Plague that “the single most important achievement of such institutions [sanatoria] – a very real and dramatically effective one – was the isolation of the infected from other potential victims.”  The scale of the facility at Booneville, which allowed it to offer so many more services than other sanatoria, allowed it to take very seriously the concept of “isolation of the infected from other potential victims.”
The number of buildings on the campus is much larger than other identified tuberculosis sanatoria around the country, and illustrates the wide variety of buildings needed to provide the proper treatments, goods, and services, to the sanatorium’s staff and patients.  The size of the facility is a reflection of the progressiveness of Arkansas in battling the disease and the fact that some of the individuals who were influential in getting the sanatorium established had personal experiences with the disease.  From the very beginning of trying to establish a tuberculosis sanatorium in Arkansas, the state looked for approximately 1,000 acres for the facility.  The fact that the bill for the establishment of the sanatorium was being pushed by Judge Joseph M. Hill (who had been diagnosed and treated in Arizona for tuberculosis) meant that the people seeking to establish the sanatorium had first-hand knowledge of what was needed in a sanatorium.  Tuberculosis was a serious disease in Arkansas and there was always a waiting list for treatments.  It wasn’t until the completion of the PWA expansions in 1938-1940 that “the waiting list [was] now controllable and persons with serious cases of tuberculosis need no longer die.”
The dramatic reductions of tuberculosis cases and deaths as a result of the use of antibiotics continued into the 1960s as well.  According to the book, The Last Crusade, “by 1967 tuberculosis was causing only fourteen new cases and 4.1 deaths per 100,000 per year.  From the time reliable record keeping began to be possible, around 1900, both new cases of tuberculosis and deaths from it had been declining at a rate of from 4 to 6 percent a year; and with the introduction of antibiotics, the falloff rate doubled.”[99]  Again the reduction in cases was reflected in Arkansas.  By 1966, Pulaski County had the largest number of cases reported that year at 44, while the other counties only had one or two new cases to report.
The 1960s also started to bring about the end of the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium.  The last major construction project at the facility took place with the construction of the Judge Joseph M. Hill Building in 1963-1964.  It was built as a surgery/intensive care unit at a cost of approximately $700,000, and was funded through monies saved by the sanatorium out of its operational funds. The building was built on the site previously occupied by Meriweather Hall, which had been built in the 1920s, while two residences that stood on the site were moved to Nature Lane, where they remain today.
By the mid-1960s, the patient population at the sanatorium had decreased dramatically.  In 1965, the sanatorium was rated by the Public Health Service as having 847 beds.  However, only an average of 374 beds were occupied in 1965, and $1,783,098 was expended on operation of the sanatorium during the 1965-1966 fiscal year. As a result, many aspects of the institution were gradually phased out.  The bakery, post office, and various other buildings were closed as operations were scaled back.  In 1968, the dairy was closed and all of the cattle and equipment were transferred to the Arkansas Department of Corrections.
The last patient was discharged from the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium on February 26, 1973, and Act 320 of the 1973 legislature was passed to “Transfer Title to the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium to the State of Arkansas; to Transfer Jurisdiction and Control Over the Sanatorium From the Department of Health to Mental Retardation-Developmental Disability Services, a Division of the Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services; to Abolish the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium; and for Other Purposes.”  The sanatorium officially closed on June 30, 1973, and when it closed it was estimated that 70,000 patients had passed through its doors.
Although the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium closed on June 30, 1973, it was not long before the campus was put to use again, opening as the Booneville Human Development Center (BHDC) in July 1973.  The facility is one of six human development centers around the state that provide residential services to people with developmental disabilities.  The BHDC currently serves a maximum of 159 people with developmental disabilities, age 19 or older.  The facility is able to provide people who are ambulatory with no severe medical needs a variety of training programs, including on-campus and off-campus trainee positions, and a variety of living arrangements from a dormitory setting to semi-independent cottage and apartment living.  The BHDC still provides these services today, and utilizes the vast majority of the buildings on campus. [1]

Arkansas,Thomas McRae Tuberculosis Home,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Thomas_McRae_Tuberculosis_Home,1923,,1931,Closed,Single Building,,Thomas C. McRae Memorial Sanatorium | Alexander Human Development Center,"The bill that created the McRae Sanatorium was introduced in the Arkansas General Assembly in 1923. It had strong support from the Arkansas Tuberculosis Association, particularly from its executive secretary, Erle Chambers. Governor Thomas C. McRae was president of the association after leaving office in 1925. Because he championed the cause, the sanatorium at Alexander bore his name. In 1924, a tract of land was chosen in Alexander because it was “near the center of Negro population” and close to Little Rock, which had additional medical facilities.
The sanatorium’s first superintendent (and only doctor) was Dr. Hugh A. Browne, a 1928 graduate of Howard University’s Medical Department. Knowing that few African-American doctors lived in Arkansas, Dr. Browne took an eighty-seven-percent pay cut (from $1,500 to $200 a month) to move to Arkansas to oversee the McRae Sanatorium. Facilities for black Arkansans were not given priority when it came to the allowance of state funds. When it opened in 1931, the McRae Sanatorium had only twenty-six beds; in 1933, ten more were added after an expansion was approved by the state legislature. In 1935, there were 160 people on McRae’s waiting list. Another expansion was approved in 1938, which paid for the creation of a dedicated patients’ building with facilities for 139 and a nurse’s home with a capacity of thirty-two. In addition, surgical facilities were added in the main building, including an operating room, dressing room, and sterilizing room.
By 1945, the waiting list at the McRae Sanatorium had increased to over 600 for the 196-bed facility. In 1946, the state legislature appropriated money for a four-story infirmary building, but it was not opened for patients until September 1949. Ten years later, in 1959, the legislature had a children’s building built on site, but new advances in medicine and surgery had cut the number of patients by 150 by that time. The children’s building and an auxiliary nurse’s home were occupied by July 1, 1960. Arkansas’s two sanatoriums remained segregated until 1967. Federal integration policies caused the two to combine, and the McRae site became the Alexander Human Development Center, which opened its doors in 1968. In addition to tuberculosis treatments, the Alexander center offered occupational, physical, and speech therapy; psychological assessments; general medical care; and rehabilitation services.
Overseen by the Arkansas Department of Human Services, the Alexander center operated for forty-three years until allegations began to arise in the early 2000s of neglect and rape of patients, failed safety inspections, and a general refusal to adhere to federal guidelines. These infractions prompted investigations, and the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette announced on May 18, 2010, that Governor Mike Beebe planned to close the Alexander Human Development Center. At the time, at least 109 men were living there. The center closed in 2011. The abandoned facility later came under private ownership before being purchased by the Alexander Police Department in 2018. A major fire damaged the structure on March 18, 2020 and has remained vacant since.",2011,"Alexander, AR",,
Arkansas,Benton County Poor Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Benton_County_Poor_Farm,1857,,1858,Demolished,,,,"In April of 1857, the court found it necessary to establish a poorhouse in Benton County. A commission was formed to find a location for the county poorhouse. A sum of $1200 was set aside for the purchase of the property when a suitable location was found. In January of 1958, the commission reported that a 45 acre site had been found just north of Bentonville. The property had a spring, a log cabin (without floor), 10 cultivated acres, and 4 acres in wheat. This land was purchased for $300 from William Clements and a survey of the property was done. The county then built the other necessary buildings on the property and moved the paupers of the county to the farm, placing them under the care of a superintendent.
When the new courthouse was completed in 1875, the temporary courthouse building was removed and resituated on the poor farm. The building was disassembled and reassembled on the the property by William Stewart and J, V. Lee at a cost of $330. An additional $120.50 was given to James Haney to be used for fitting the building out.  The poor farm housed an average of about 8 to 10 people at a time. It went by several other names, including the poorhouse, or the pauper's farm. In 1907, a special act of the general assembly changed the name to the Benton County Home. The people who lived at the poor farm were called inmates or paupers, which were common terms for the poor at the time.
In November of 1905, the Benton County Home was moved to a new location about where the Benton County Services building is located on Highway 102 West. The inmates were taken care of by a contract that provided a set amount day per inmate. In 1906, W. R. Ford was awarded a contract for 30 cents a day, which was intended to also provide board, clothing, and medical treatment. The lowest bid, which wasn't accepted, had been 15 cents. The contract system left the inmates at the mercy of the contractor, so the system was later abandoned, and a superintendent was hired for the county home. The County Home was open until the 1940s or 1950s when other facilities took its place.",1951,"Bentonville, AR",,
