Prior to that, municipal governments were tasked exclusively with the care of dependents having legal settlement, which usually entailed long term residence there. The care of unsettled paupers, increasingly immigrants from western Europe, was only undertaken in local almshouses at state expense. After 1852, the state assumed full responsibility for the indoor care of unsettled paupers, which meant the construction of four large new state almshouses. These were located on Rainsford Island, Tewksbury, Monson and Bridgewater. Within just over a decade, the function of each would become increasingly specialized. The sick and elderly were sent to Tewksbury, infectious immigrants to Rainsford and children to Monson. Bridgewater was left to becomes a place increasingly of undesirables and the so called ""undeserving poor,"" people who were thought to be poor out of idleness, inebriation and other vices. Over the years Bridgewater would change significantly in both form and function, but its image as a place for undesirables would persist.
The first major shift came in 1866 when a the Workhouse for Vicious Paupers was established alongside the Alsmhouse (St 1866, c 198). The Almhouse would later be abolished in 1872 (St 1872, c 45). Of the workhouse system, a Senate Document published in 1870 notes that ""a large majority of those confined in it come from the vicious classes of society. They are made up of the criminal poor-the lewd, the intemperate, and those suffering from a disease which is in itself a proof of their abandoned character."" (Senate Report No. 110, 1870) In that year there were 323 commitments to the Workhouse.
In 1887 the facility became the State Farm and its agricultural operations were expanded. Farming increasingly became an important feature of the facility and the annual reports of superintendents focused as much attention on crop and livestock production as they did on activities and services for inmates. According to the Eighteenth Annual Report of the Commissioners of Prison (January 1889), in its first year the State Farm received 234 commitments including six women. Their crimes against public order and decency included tramp (155), vagabond (43), drunkenness (23), and escape (10). At the close of the year 
(September 30, 1888) there were 129 men and five women held at the facility. These inmates were put to the task of raising crops, tending to livestock, and performing other agricultural tasks.
Many inmates in the workhouses, almshouses, and penitentiaries of the late nineteenth century were diagnosed as having some form of mental illness. Among them, some were classified as ""criminally insane"" because of their proclivity towards disruptive and violent behavior. Prior to 1890, these mentally ill prisoners were sent to the State Lunatic Hospital at Worcester. In addition to this criminal population, the Worcester Hospital housed those who were civilly committed.
Due principally to their violent nature, the ""criminally insane"" became too burdensome for the State Lunatic Hospital and the Commonwealth began to send them to the State Farm at Bridgewater. The Massachusetts legislature formalized this arrangement in 1895 by statutorily mandating that ""all male prisoners who are announced insane after an examination are removed, if the 
Governor so decides, to the State Asylum for Insane Criminals which is a department of the State Farm at Bridgewater."" Through the end of the century, there was an average of 85 prisoners removed to the Asylum each year.
At the end of their sentences these prisoners would be discharged. In 1899, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, in its decision In re Donne , changed this practice. It stipulated that if the insane prisoner did not recover before the expiration of his sentence he was required to remain in the State Asylum as an insane person, subject to be discharged at any time, as was the case for other ""lunatics."" In essence, this decision made the rules for discharge of the criminally insane consistent with those for the civilly committed.
In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 199 of the Acts of 1919, supervision of the State Farm was transferred from the State Board of Charity and Trustees of the State Infirmary and State Farm to the Bureau of Prisons. The institution then con- 
sisted of three departments-prison, alms, and insane.
As reported in its Annual Report for 1919, the State Farm held as many as 1,812 inmates during that year, including 860 ""lunatics,"" 547 male and 87 female prisoners, and 318 paupers. This was the lowest census in thirty years causing the Bureau to 
warn the legislature that the physical plant and farming production may suffer ""unless your honorable body extends the authority of the courts in the matter of commitments, or makes some arrangements whereby its population may be materially increased in numbers."" This decline in population was seen in all correctional institutions. The Bureau reported that ""not since prison statistics in this State have been compiled have there been so few commitments to the penal institutions of the Commonwealth as the number of persons committed during the year ending September 30, 1919."" The Bureau attributed the drop-off to ""wartime prohibition, probation and abnormal industrial conditions.""
In the same year, the insane department of the State Farm reported 72 admissions: 56 from state and county correctional institutions; 14 from the courts; and one each from hospitals for the insane and from jails awaiting trial. The prison department reported 1,046 admissions: 802 for drunkenness; 194 for tramps, vagabonds, and vagrants; and the balance for idle and disorderly, offenses against morality, nonsupport, assault, larceny, property damage, disturbing the peace, and escape. The 
alms department, housing both male and female aged and infirm poor, reported 240 admissions. Most were the overflow of admissions to the State Infirmary in Tewksbury.
In 1922, two additional populations were added. In May of that year the Department for Defective Delinquents was established at the State Farm. In the 1922 Annual Report, the Commissioners of Correction characterized the creation of this distinct unit as a pioneering effort in caring for and studying the ""morally deficient, morally blunted, or with character traits which form a basis for his delinquencies [and] make of him a social misfit and public liability."" These people need not have been 
convicted or even charged with a crime. The court needed only to be satisfied that the person was dangerous or had dangerous tendencies. In the first five months of operation there were 33 admissions: 20 transferred from the Wrentham State School; 5 from the School for the Feeble-Minded at Waverly (as persistent violators of school rules); 7 direct court commitments; and 1 from the Department of Public Health.
The Bridgewater population also expanded with the enactment of Chapter 535 of the Acts of 1922 which provided for the commitment of drug addicted patients to the State Farm for up to two years. The commitment could be made without a criminal conviction, similar to the process for committing the insane. In 1923 the State Farm received one admission pursuant to this Act. As of 
September 30, 1922 the other departments of the State Farm held 1,640 inmates: prison department--459 male and 65 female prisoners; alms department--245 male and 1 female pauper; and the insane department--870 male lunatics.
Twelve years later (1934) the population stood at 2,445. The alms department was down to 4 paupers; the prison department housed 1,095 males and 1 female prisoner; the insane department held 913 patients; the defective delinquent department was up to 331 male and 81 female inmates; and there were 9 inebriates, 9 committed and 2 voluntarily admitted drug addicted patients. 
The superintendent, James E. Warren, and the Medical Director of the Insane Department, William T. Hanson, both recommended a separate institution for the criminally insane. ""It should be under the supervision and control of the Department of Mental Diseases and not subjected to a divided responsibility."" Furthermore, they urged that ""minor offenders and men committed to our jails and houses of correction be committed to hospitals for civil cases..."" (Annual Report of the Commissioners of Correction . 1934)
Transcription of The Bridgewater correctional complex a policy report of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means Published November,1987
Theories of delinquent causality and reforms in the treatment of the insane proliferated in the early decades of the twentieth century. In their wake a major restructuring of large bureaucracies followed. Simultaneously, those charged with the 
care of the infirm and mentally ill became acutely aware of the need to separate these groups according to the demands they posed on society and their requisite needs, thus adhering to Superintendent Woodward's plea for classification and Superintendent Warren's urging separation of the mentally ill from the criminal population.
In the middle of the twentieth century the Commonwealth's correction system underwent major restructuring. In 1955, acting upon the report of the Governor's Committee to Study the Massachusetts Correctional System (known as the Wessell Committee), the legislature enacted substantial reforms and changes in the organization of the Department of Correction. In unifying the then 
eight state prisons, the law gave each a common title and the State Farm became the Massachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI) at Bridgewater. The institution was broken into three separate departments; a fourth was added in 1959:
In the 1960's and 1970's, as the result of significant developments in mental health treatment, the nature of Bridgewater State Hospital changed dramatically from one providing long-term care to one specializing in short-term evaluations and treatment.
The first development occurred in 1966 when the Supreme Court held in Baxtrom v. Herold that mentally ill persons could not be held in a maximum security psychiatric hospital longer than a criminal sentence without a hearing on the substantive 
issues of that commitment. The Commonwealth responded in 1968 by holding special Superior Court hearings at the State Hospital to determine whether the patient required the care, treatment, and security of Bridgewater. As a result, over 50 percent of the long-term care patients were discharged to other mental health facilities and services.
The second development which changed the complexion of the treatment at the state hospital occurred with the 1971 reform of the 
Commonwealth's mental health statutes. In response to the Baxtrom decision, the legislature overhauled the laws regarding commitments to mental health hospitals, including Bridgewater State Hospital. The new law created separate processes for civil commitments and criminal referrals, and established the following requirements as standards for commitment: the person must be 
mentally ill, is not a proper subject for a mental health facility, and is in need of strict security. Moreover, the reform law greatly limited the amount of time an individual could remain at the State Hospital for observation or treatment without 
judicial review.
Despite these limitations on long-term commitment, admissions to Bridgewater State Hospital grew dramatically in the late 1970's. Between 1975 and 1982 the increase was almost 60 percent, from 716 to 1,137 admissions. Ironically, much of the in- 
crease was created by the deinstitutionalization of mental health facilities which began in the 1960's. While there was much support for the move to a community-based mental health system, full realization was complicated by judicially imposed 
limitations on involuntary treatment and inadequate resources to support patients in the community. Large numbers of the mentally ill were left homeless and unable to care for themselves. Many resorted to petty crime or substance abuse. This 
population ended up at Bridgewater. Some were committed through the courts or referred through the correctional system and others entered through the Addiction Center.
Two other significant events at Bridgewater in the early 1970's contributed to increasing commitments--a modern physical plant and improvements in professional care and treatment. In 1974 a new 450-bed State Hospital opened and was described by one therapist as a ""modern, campus-like facility, surrounded by 'see-through' chain link fences rather than a solid wall."" Closely 
following that was the introduction of a new treatment team. Until 1975, the State Hospital employed its own treatment staff. Following a hearing in federal court regarding a patient's alleged lack of treatment, the Department of Correction agreed to 
contract with outside experts for these services. The first contractor was McLean Hospital which brought to the facility a highly regarded, professional treatment staff and affiliation with Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard School of Medicine.
For the next ten years, the new facility operated relatively smoothly. However, the mid-1980's marked the onset of a period of organizational and management turmoil at the State Hospital, beginning with the retirement in March 1985 of long-time 
superintendent, Charles Gaughan. Since Gaughan's departure two years ago, the Department of Correction has employed three different superintendents.
The mid-1980's also saw a change in mental health service providers to Bridgewater. In 1986 Goldberg Associates was awarded the clinical program contract replacing McLean Hospital. A major turnover of treatment staff ensued, leaving a number of posi- 
tions vacant for a lengthy period of time. Additionally, in the spring of 1987, the individual employed under contract as medical director was fired after accusations of absenteeism. In summary, since 1985 the State Hospital has had three superintendents and two medical directors.
From the Massachusetts state archive:
St 1866, c 198 established the State Workhouse at the State Almshouse at Bridgewater, like it under the Board of State Charities. The almshouse itself was abolished by St 1872, c 45. St 1879, c 291, which replaced the Board of State Charities with the State Board of Health, Lunacy, and Charity, gave the workhouse its own board of trustees, replacing a board of inspectors; St 1884, c 297 replaced this by a Board of Trustees of the State Almshouse i.e., at Tewksbury and State Workhouse.
After a fire, St 1883, c 279 authorized removal of the workhouse to quarters at the State Reform School at Westborough; return to Bridgewater was authorized by Resolves 1884, c 76. St 1887, c 264 renamed the institution the State Farm.
The institution was placed successively under the State Board of Lunacy and Charity (St 1886, c 101, s 5) and the State Board of Charity (St 1898, c 433, s 24) --by 1918 its governing board was called the Board of Trustees of the State Infirmary and State Farm. St 1919, c 199 removed the State Farm from both boards, placing it under the Massachusetts Bureau of Prisons, replaced per St 1919, c 350, s 86 by the Dept. of Correction.
The institution originally received inmates of state almshouses convicted of being rogues, vagabonds, and the like (i.e., misdemeanors) as per GS 1860, c 165, s 28. (This was extended to anyone so convicted per St 1869, c 258.) Also admitted were incorrigible inmates of state juvenile reform institutions. State charges generally could be placed there as well per St 1872, c 45 (i.e., after the closing of the Bridgewater almshouse) by the Board of State Charities (and successors)--by the Dept. of Public Welfare per St 1921, c 486, s 28. Also admitted were aged or physically or mentally infirm inmates of the State Prison (St 1890, c 180; St 1915, c 184)
Insane male state paupers were committed there per St 1886, c 219; these were limited to inmates of correctional institutions per St 1894, c 251. St 1895, c 390 designated so-involved parts of the State Farm as the State Asylum for Insane Criminals, placed per St 1898, c 433, s 9 under the State Board of Insanity (and successors) and known per St 1909, c 504, s 98 (and which see): Bridgewater State Hospital.
St 1911, c 595 authorized a department of defective delinquents (established 1922) and St 1922, c 535 designated the State Farm as a correctional unit for alcoholics and drug addicts, inheriting functions of the Norfolk State Hospital.
St 1955, c 770, reorganizing the state correctional system, redesignated the State Farm as Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Bridgewater. Its functions relating to misdemeanor convicts were terminated per St 1956, c 715, s 21; to state charges generally per St 1956, c 715, s 5; to aged or infirm state prisoners per St 1955, c 770, s 122; to defective delinquents and drug addicts per St 1970, c 888, s 6 (effective 1971); those relating to incorrigible inmates of state juvenile reform institutions had already been terminated per St 1948, c 310, s 22.
A unit was added for treatment of sexually dangerous persons per St 1958, c 646, under the jurisdiction of the Dept. of Mental Health (see: Massachusetts Treatment Center)
Presently, the site houses the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Bridgewater (MCl-Bridgewater), which is the Commonwealth's largest correctional complex.

Titicut Follies is a black and white 1967  documentary film by United States filmmaker Frederick Wiseman about the treatment of inmates / patients at Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane, a Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The title is taken from a talent show put on by the hospital's inmates. (The talent show was named after the Wampanoag  word for the nearby Taunton River.) In 1967 the film won awards in Germany and Italy. It was one of a number of films made by Wiseman that examined social institutions: hospital, police, school, etc., in the United States.",,"Bridgewater, MA",,
Massachusetts,Boston State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Boston_State_Hospital,1839,,1884 (Second Location),Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Mattapan State Hospital |  Dorchester Counseling Center |  Solomon Carter Fuller Mental Health Center -Dorchester Campus,"The Boston State Hospital – originally called the Boston Lunatic Asylum – was founded in South Boston in 1839. By the 1880s, new ideas about the care of the mentally ill emphasized the importance of fresh air, hard work, and separation from the adverse influences (both social and environmental) of city life, an approach that was referred to as “moral treatment.” Thus, when the time came to move out of the old and overcrowded facilities in South Boston, the Asylum’s leaders looked to West Roxbury – at that time a semi-rural area that had only recently been incorporated into the city of Boston – as an appropriate setting for a new hospital.
Beginning in 1884, some Asylum residents were moved to the former almshouse at Austin Farm, just across Morton Street from the present Boston Nature Center, where the Harvard Commons development stands today. In 1892, looking for more room for both buildings and farmland, the City purchased the 35-acre Pierce Farm, along Walk Hill and Canterbury Streets – part of which land is now the western end of the BNC. A few years later, the City bought another parcel of land, adjoining Pierce Farm and Canterbury Street, which now includes much of the Clark Cooper Community Gardens and other areas in the central part of the BNC.
It was soon decided that Austin Farm would house women, while Pierce Farm became the “Department for Men” of the recently renamed Boston Insane Hospital. The new buildings at Pierce Farm, designed by city architect Edmund March Wheelwright, opened in 1895, and a few additional farm buildings were added over the following years.
In 1908, the city sold the buildings and 153 acres of land to the state for one million dollars, and the facility was renamed the Boston State Hospital. Hospital trustees envisioned a grand expansion scheme, published in the 1919 Annual Report, to fully develop the hospital to a maximum capacity of 5000 patients. This scheme was never fully realized, due primarily to the State Board of Insanity's position that no facility for the mentally ill should house more than 2000 patients. Construction of the Metropolitan state Hospital in Haltham in 1930 ""led to a much reduced and seemingly haphazard building program"" at Boston State.
Expansion at the hospital temporarily halted in 1920, and resumed with the construction of a number of buildings under public work projects in the 1930s. Most recent construction took place in the late 1960s/early 1970s. The oldest building on hospital property a ca. 1865 farmhouse near Walk Hill Street, burned and was subsequently razed in the winter of 1989.
In 1951 the resident population of the hospital hit an all-time high of 3,100, about 30% over the institution’s official capacity. The facility had
extensive farming and, similar to Medfield State Hospital, emphasized fresh air, hard work, and separation from the adverse influences of city life to help restore the patients’ mental health by incorporating residents in the operations, expansions, and improvements as an important part of therapy.
Almost all of the buildings from the former BSH have been demolished except for three cottages that have been restored and are now being used by the Mass Audubon Nature Center, and
another old building that will be renovated by the U. Mass Biologic Laboratory. There still remains a significant amount of unused, overgrown land and wetlands, although the old roads still exist and can be used. Other than the properties that have been sold, DCAMM is the land owner. In 1996, with the unanimous approval of the Community Advisory Committee for the Boston State Hospital planning process, the Massachusetts Audubon Society bought the Boston State Hospital land from the City at a price of $10 per acre. Mass Audubon then established a community adversary board of 30 people, more than half of whom came from surrounding communities (The Boston Nature Center and Wildlife Sanctuary, 1996).

(Danvers Resivoir, Original brick shell of Kirkbride complex. (D, F, G Wings)",Kirkbride Plan,Nathaniel J. Bradlee,Danvers State Insane Asylum | Danvers State Asylum | Danvers State Lunatic Asylum,"Constructed at a cost of $1.5 million, with the estimated yearly per capita cost of patients being $3,000 the hospital originally consisted of two main center buildings, housing the administration, with four radiating wings. The outer wings (A and J) housed the dangerous patients. The administration building measured 90 by 60 feet, with a tower 130 feet tall. Connected in the rear was a building 180 by 60 feet, in which the kitchens, laundries, chapel, and dormitories for the attendants. In the rear is the boiler house of 70 feet square, with boilers of 450 horsepower, used for heating and ventilation. Water was pumped from Middleton Pond. On each side of the administration are the wings, west side was male, east side was female, connected by small square towers, with the exception of the last ones on each side, which are joined by octagonal towers. The former measured 10 feet square, and were used to separate the buildings. The original plan was designed to house 500 patients, with 100 more possible to accommodate in the attic. The buildings that make up the campus are the main hospital, the Bonner medical building, the gray gables, the male and female nurse homes, the male and female tubercular buildings, the repair shops, the mechanics garage, a work farm, a power plant, a gazebo, several homes and cottages, and some other buildings. However, by the late 1930s and 1940s, over 2,000 patients were being housed, and overcrowding was severe.
While the hospital was originally established to provide residential treatment and care to the mentally ill and the criminally insane, its functions expanded to include a training program for nurses in 1889 and a pathological research laboratory in 1895. In the 1890s, Dr. Charles Page, the superintendent, declared mechanical restraint unnecessary and harmful in cases of mental illness. By the 1920s the hospital was operating school clinics to help determine mental deficiency in children. During the 1960s as a result of increased emphasis on alternative methods of treatment, de-institutionalization, and community-based mental health care, the inpatient population started to decrease. Due to budget cuts within the mental health system the hospital was closed in June 1992.
In December of 2005, the property was sold to Avalon Bay Development. Demolition of most of the buildings began in January of 2006, with the intent to build 497 apartments and condominiums on the 77 acre site. By June 2006, all of the Danvers State Hospital buildings that were marked for demolition had been torn down, including all of the buildings on the lower grounds and all of the buildings on the hill except for the center-most sections of the Kirkbride buildings. Avalon Bay predicted that they would have properties available for rent/sale by Fall 2007.
However, on April 7, 2007, four of the new apartment complex buildings and four of Avalon bay's construction trailers burned down in a large fire visible from Boston, some seventeen miles away. The fire was confined mostly to the buildings under construction on the eastern end, and the damage to the remaining Kirkbride spires slightly catching fire due to excessive heat. An investigation is underway concerning the cause of the fire. Avalon Bay provided a live web cam of the construction at the old site of the hospital at their website; however, the pictures cut out at approximately 2:03 AM the night of the fire, and the web cam was disabled.

In 1905 the hospital began to treat psychiatric disorders, and by 1910 it was solely a psychiatric institution, and became known as Foxboro (or Foxborough) State Hospital. The hospital ceased most of it's operations in 1976, but the buildings have been used for other purposes such as file storage and haunted houses during the Halloween season. The layout of this institution was very unique; the original inebriate asylum consisted of a few isolated buildings that were later connected by very long hallways, which served as day rooms. Patient rooms were in wings that branched off to the sides, and the newest additions (circa 1950's) were dormitories that were covered in tile. Many cupolas adorn the roof, and the basement holds a surprisingly large eight body morgue. There are two cemeteries nearby holding around 1,100 patients with headstones marked with only a patient number and a grave number.
The Foxboro State Hospital closed in 1976, however many parts of the building were put to re-use by various government entities. The hospital's Theatre was also home to the Foxboro Jaycee's haunted house one year. In 2004 the property was sold to a developer and early constrction began, and early in 2006 the buildings were almost completely prepared for either demolition or restoration. In July, 2006 a four-alarm fire ripped through a ward of the main hospital building. The fire was mostly contained to that one ward. By 2009 a large portion of the older buildings had been converted to condominiums & office space.

There are two cemeteries for Foxboro State Hospital and they are not on the grounds. The cemeteries are about an 1/8 of a mile from the hospital on Cross Street. One is close to the road and the other is about 125 yards up into the woods. The names and corresponding grave numbers have been lost. There may be 1,100 former DMH clients buried in the two cemeteries. When researching these cemeteries Pat Deegan noticed that each marker has two sets of numbers. The first list the order in which the burial took place. The second number, on the back of the stone, seems to be a patient identification number. It would be relatively easy to reconstruct a list of who is buried based on these numbers. A group would have to get special permission from the state to match numbers with names but once that was done, a complete list could be reconstructed.",,,,

A 1945 Governor's report called attention to the fact that there were children as young as seven among the patient population at Metropolitan State Hospital. Nine years later in 1954, a dedicated children's unit was established at Metropolitan State Hospital, names after Dr. William C. Gaebler, the second superintendent at Metropolitan. The center was officially opened on October 8, 1955. Early reports compared it favorably to the only other dedicated children's unit at the time established some years before at Rockland State Hospital in Orange County NY. Shortly before its closure, Gaebler was separated as an administrative unit from Metropolitan State Hospital. It closed on January 31, 1992.
Demolition of the Gaebler Children's Center was completed in January 2011. The work cost the City of Waltham approximately $637,000. There are no current plans for the 55 acre lot.

By 1901 farm colonies had been implemented by Fernald State School for the care of long term custodial residents as well as in Grafton by the Worcester Lunatic Hospital. Over the next twenty years, further colonies would be established as satellites to numerous state hospitals as well as for the treatment of Hanson's disease and alcoholism. Gardner State Colony was established in 1902 for the treatment and custodial care of the chronic insane. The advantages of the colony model as compared to large single building or cottage plan institutions had to do with cost. By implementing large scale farming operations supported by residences built on a cheaper domestic scale, state colonies were expected to work towards self-sufficiency, while limiting the need for special appropriations by the legislature. The hospital served the North Worcester County area, and maintained both agricultural and livestock farm areas which were basically self- supporting. In 1970, a phase-down of in-patient facilities was instituted in the state of Massachusetts, and the Gardner facility was officially closed in 1975.
The North Central Correctional Institution at Gardner, as it is now known, is located on twenty acres of hillside near the Gardner/Westminster town line. The dedication of this medium security facility was held on June 18, 1981, with the first ten inmates accepted into the prison two weeks later. Within the facility are eighteen buildings, with a perimeter consisting of two chain-linked fences topped with razor wire. The perimeter is manned by three towers and foot patrols of K9 teams.
Reconstruction and renovation of the facility has continued for more than a decade, with many of the projects enabling the prison to increase the inmate population. In 1982, the school building and Thompson Hall East Wing were renovated. A year later, the perimeter was expanded and additional buildings were converted into inmate housing. In 1985, completion of the modular unit and a subsequent expansion of the unit a year later also increased inmate capacity. Most recently, a new kitchen and gymnasium were built, with two other buildings renovated in order to accommodate inmate housing. As a result of these projects and renovations, over 1,000 inmates are now housed at NCCI-Gardner.
The grounds not occupied by NCCI-Gardner are now public hunting land known as High Ridge Wildlife Management Area. In the fall, the grounds are stocked with pheasants for public hunting.

Massachusetts,Grafton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Grafton_State_Hospital,,1901,,Closed,Cottage Plan,,,"Grafton State Hospital was established in its present location in 1901 (Chapter 434) as a farm colony for ""chronic insane patients"" of the 'Insane Hospital' in Worcester. In 1912 it was administratively separated from Worcester (Chapter 679). By 1945 the number of patients had risen to 1,730, with a total staff of 250 with 241 vacancies. By this time the institution had grown to 1,200 acres with buildings scattered widely over an area covering three towns. After 72 years of operation Grafton State Hospital was closed in 1973 as the first of a series of institutions to close in Massachusetts. The campus is now occupied by the Tufts University Veterinary School, the Federal Job Corps Program, and various state agencies. Most structures have been renovated and altered for re-use, some have been demolished. A graveyard remains on a nearby hilltop with 1,041 numbered, nameless graves of persons who died in this institution. A handwritten list of their names survives in various archives.
This and the following information was assembled from various texts of the Massachusetts Historical Commission, National Register of Historic Preservation Registration Form, 1993. Grafton State Hospital was nominated as one of fifteen institutions for the 'State Hospital and School System' nomination. All fifteen sites were accepted and are group-listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
The former Grafton State Hospital is located at the juncture of the Grafton, Shrewsbury, and Westborough town lines one the eastern edge of the Central Massachusetts uplands. State Route 9 is located several miles north of the campus, with I-90 to the south and State Routes 20 and 140 to the west. The original site of 700 acres was expanded to over 800 acres by 1908 with purchase of portions of Green Hill to expand the water supply. By 1945 it encompassed 1200 acres. The campus is roughly bisected by Westborough Road and a former Boston & Worcester Raiload line. Pine Street provides access to the north campus (Pines Group) while Willard Street (farm group) and Institute Road (Oaks Group) lead south off Westborough Road. Green Hill, which forms the northern edge of the campus, is the primary topographic landmark. The surrounding area remains very rural and sparsely populated despite the proximity of North Grafton (SW), Grafton Center (S), Westborough Center (NE) and Shrewsbury Center (NW). The campus occupies a hilly scenic site surrounded by woodlands, wetlands, and agricultural fields which are still used for hay and corn. The campus was originally developed as a farm colony for the old downtown 'Worcester State Hospital' of 1830 (demolished). Most of this land had been allowed to go fallow by private owners in the late-ninetheenth century, and was only gradually reclaimed for productive use by the hospital.
Grafton State Hospital was based on the so-called 'satellite colony system'. Four fully developed and geographically isolated colonies for the ""chronic insane"" are dispersed over the campus. These colonies and their component buildings are linked by tree-lined internal roadways, many of which display acorn globe streetlights. The colonies developed around the nuclei of pre-existing farmsteads (encompassing the farms of Samuel Knowlton, Lyman Rice, the Ashley family, and the Sinclair family). The colonies were named according to their location: Pines, Elms, Oaks, and Willows. Most of Willows was demolished in the 1970s.
The three colonies served separate 'classes of patients' (my quotes) with distinct needs. Pines was primarily intended to serve ""excited"" female patients and was thus developed with large-scale brick wards that provided locked confinement for large numbers of inmates. Similarly, Elms was developed with masonry buildings for ""excited"" male patients. A few wood-frame dormitories provided a transition for more stable patients. As the center of agricultural activities, Oaks was developed with unlocked cottages for male patients who had proved themselves trustworthy and industrious. (All of this is transcibed verbatim from the National Register of Historic Places nomination forms by the Historical Commission.) The Willows, which was developed somewhat later during the 1910s campus expansion, seems to have been similar to Oaks. It is important to note that the 'classes of patients' were defined in terms of behavior rather than diagnosis, e.g. ""excited"", ""violent"", ""quiet"", ""peaceful"", etc. The building and landscape elements of the Elms, Oaks, and Pines colonies are described in greater detail below.
DISCUSSION OF THE TERMS 'FARM COLONY' & 'CHRONIC PATIENT' (1856.org/Anna Schuleit)
The 1908 Annual Report of the State Board defined the term 'farm colony' thus: ""The colony idea applies to the harmless, quiet, able-bodied chronic patients. Its aims are provision of a home with natural interests, industrial re-education of the demented, and their training in useful occupations for self-improvement and support.""
This definition of the term 'farm colony' should appear curious to us today not only for its discriminating language but also for the inherent definition of the term 'chronic', which is found in the Grafton State Hospital entry of the four-volume ""Institutional Care of the Insane"" of 1916, by Henry Hurd: ""The question as to who were the chronic insane was decided by the dates of the commitment papers."" (Hurd, 1916, p.711) At this point it should be pointed out that a patient who was found 'chronic' would rarely leave the institution again. Many patients at Grafton State Hospital were there for decades and entire lifetimes. Interviews conducted by 1856.org with former employees confirm this fact. At the same time it must be pointed out that many patients had been abandoned by their families once they entered the institution labeled as 'chronic'. Those patients who died at the institution and whose bodies remained unclaimed by their families were buried without gravestones at the remote graveyard of the institution, and of those there were not a few dozen but one thousand and forty-one.
In the same source (Hurd, 1916), the supposed benefits of the 'farm colony' are further described: ""Dr. Scribner (superintendent) encouraged open-air and out-of-doors work for both sexes and many patients who had been cared for on closed wards seemed glad to be out of doors, where fresh air, plenty of work and a different environment helped to change many of them from turbulent to quiet and industrious patients."" (p. 714) The inherent problematic of patient labor as found in the histories of numerous state institutions is that those patients who were found to work well on the farm and in the shops were only reluctantly discharged by the staff. At the same time, those who were unable or unwilling to work were more readily labeled 'chronic' and hence also remained at the institution. For both groups of patients, the outcome was the same: long-term institutionalization. As the hiring of staff slowed down during the first half of 20th century, the number of patients continued to rise, and the cycle reinforced itself. The institutions relied heavily on patient labor, which was routinely unpaid. Returning those who were hoping to be treated for a psychiatric disability to the community was thus contradicted and made impossible by the institutional set-up itself, which is the sad irony of the history of Grafton State Hospital and other such institutions. In a recent message the acting commissioner of the Department of Mental Health, Ken Duckworth, reminds us that ""that our priorities must be to provide the best services to our clients, in the settings to which they all aspire: in the community.""

Massachusetts,Massachusetts Mental Health Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Massachusetts_Mental_Health_Center,1911,,,Demolished,Single Building,,Massachusetts State Psychiatric Institute | Boston Psychopathic Hospital,"In November 1909 the site for the hospital was purchased on Fenwood Road, 5 minutes' walk from Harvard Medical School. Dr. Elmer E. Southard was appointed director of the hospital early in 1910, to supervise its construction. On June 24, 1912 the Psychiatric Hospital was formally opened as a department of Boston State Hospital.
On May 1, 1919 the Massachusetts State Psychiatric Institute was separated from the Psychopathic Department of the Boston State Hospital, which relieved the psychopathic department of scientific research, leaving it with purely hospital functions. On December 1, 1920 the psychopathic department was made into a separate Boston Psychopathic Hospital, under director Dr. C. Macfie Campbell. It was later renamed the Massachusetts Mental Health Center.
It was initially created to provide for the reception, diagnosis, and disposition of acute psychiatric patients in Boston, usually admitting patients for short periods only. After diagnosis patients were transferred to state hospitals or discharged for outpatient care. As the institution developed a reputation for acive teaching and research in psychiatry, cases from other state hospitals were transferred to it for observation or special treatment. After the first few years outpatient care was offered not only to discharged patients, but to the general public, with emergency and diagnostic services and special units for children and adolescents. The outpatient department of BPH was renamed the Southard Clinic in the mid-1940's in honor of the first superintendent.
By 1943 BPH was no longer a receiving hospital for all patients. Its focus instead shifted to treating and researching various mental illnesses. While many of the state hospitals were primarily custodial in nature, BPH emphasized treatment. During the 1950's and 60's it became more of a community-based facility, which was formalized when it was assigned DMH catchment areas in 1967. At the same time the change of name to Massachusetts Mental Health Center reflected its evolution into a multifaceted facility. [1]
The Building at Fenwood Road in Boston was demolished in late 2003. A new facility on Morton Street in Jamaica Plain, MA was set to open in 2012.
In 2003, artist Anna Schuleit filled the halls of the formed MMHC Building with 28,00 potted flowers. This project, called BLOOM, was in remembrance of the patients and employees of the hospital, which was slated for demolition after being open for over 90 years.
In an interview with Collosal, Schuleit said,
""In 2003 I was working as visiting artist in a psychiatric institution in central Massachusetts when I got a call from another institution in Boston that was about to close. I was asked if I would consider creating a project for the closing of the historic building—the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. I said I needed to see the building, learn about its history and people and its particular architecture. I had done this sort of work before, at the Northampton State Hospital in 2000, a project that took me almost four years to complete. But here I had no more than three months to do the entire project, start to finish. So I started immediately. I asked for an office in which to crash and brainstorm, a key to every door in the building, and a person who knew all its stories. It took me about a week to create the concept for the project, and then three whirling months to make it happen.""[2]

Massachusetts,Medfield State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Medfield_State_Hospital,1892,1896,1896,Closed,Cottage Plan,William Pitt Wentworth,Medfield Insane Asylum,"Medfield State Hospital was founded by an act of the State Legislature in 1892. The property consisted of several hundred acres and twenty two buildings. Over the years the buildings and land were increased until it reached its maximum size of some fifty eight buildings and nine hundred plus acres.
The Hospital has had as many as 2,200 patients on the property and a staff of in the range of 500-900 persons. It was in effect, a self contained community with a population at the time rivaling the size of the Town of Medfield. The facility supplied its own power, heat, water, sewage system, and raised its own livestock and produce. Medfield State Hospital claimed to be the first mental health hospital to be built on the “cottage plan” with individual buildings to allow for better light ventilation, easier classification, and to create a more homelike environment.
During the Kennedy Administration, in the early 1960s, Congress passed a law requiring that all mental health patients in the United States be housed or hospitalized in the least restrictive environment possible. In the early seventies, as a result of this law, patients, guardians, and parents of patients filed a class action suit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Department of Mental Health (DMH) to require the DMH to conform with the federal law. In 1974, a federal court consent decree was entered into by the DMH resulting in the relocation of most mental patients from isolated mental institutions to community based halfway houses and hospitals. A result of this decision has been to reduce the number of patients at Medfield to approximately 200. It has also set in motion DMH’s plan to eventually dispose all or part of the Medfield facility, along with seven other similar institutions across the State.
Because a large part of the property was either in the Charles River Flood Plain or was environmentally valuable, some 350-acres, of the 900 plus acres was transferred to the Department of Environmental Management (formerly the Department of Natural Resources) during the early 1970s. Fifty seven acres was given to the Town of Medfield for recreational purposes and some ten acres was taken for the new Route 27 right of way.
The Town of Medfield purchased the property from DCAMM in December 2014. Prior to the purchase by the town, a mediation committee worked with DCAMM to complete the remediation of the former State Hospital landfill area adjacent to the Charles River. A $5 Million Dollar cleanup restored the floodplain and capped impacted landfill material on site, converting the former power plant area into a public park. Since closing, the hospital also served as filming locations for motion pictures such as Shutter Island, The Box, and Knives Out.

Massachusetts,Metropolitan State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Metropolitan_State_Hospital,1912,1928,1929,Demolished,Cottage Plan,Gordon Robb,,"It became apparent that while the mental health system as a whole was overcrowded, the most urgent need was in the metropolitan area. Intense debate over possible solutions occurred in 1908-1926. The Trustees of the newly acquired Boston State Hospital advocated for expansion of their facility to a 5,000 patient capacity, but were unable to convince the State Board of Insanity of the merits of that proposal. The need for a second metropolitan area hospital was identified as early as 1908.
Introduced to the state legislature in 1912, the board authorized spending in January of 1915. A site that was in close proximity to the Walter E. Fernald State School was immediately acquired. Plans were prepared for a 1,900 patient facility to be built on the cottage/colony plan. No action was taken for several years due to the Trustees of Boston State Hospital continue to argue for their own expansion and the first World War diverted state attention and funds.
Finally, in 1927, the State legislature responded by appropriating $1,500,000 for preparation of the Waltham site. The ground breaking ceremony took place on December 27, 1927 at the Administration Building. Cornerstone laying ceremonies were held on October 17, 1928. Construction costs were kept down by the use of the plain red brick buildings of early American colonial type. Trim elements, including pedimented pavilions and quoins, were deleted from the ward buildings. As the first campus developed in the automobile age, Met State did not require immediate adjacency to railroad facilities. As the most recent of the State's institutional treatment centers for the insane Metropolitan State Hospital represented the third and final stage in the evolving form of hospitals for the mentally ill. Like its predecessors, the Kirkbride and cottage/colony, it responded to increases in patient populations within the constraints of a publicly funded budget which both often failed.
Most of the buildings were demolished in 2006 with the exception of the Administrative building, the Auditorium and portions of the CTG, which were renovated as part of a housing complex.

Massachusetts,Northampton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Northampton_State_Hospital,1855,1856,1858,Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,Jonathan Preston,Northampton Insane Hospital | Northampton Lunatic Hospital,"The Lunatic Hospital at Northampton was authorized in 1855 to relieve overcrowding in the Commonwealth's existing asylums at Worcester and Taunton, and especially to serve the population of the state's four western counties. It was planned for 250 patients, a population that was not expected to be reached for some time. Prior to improvement of
the originally purchased 185 acres overlooking the town of Northampton one mile to the east. Built in 1856, the Northampton Lunatic Hospital was the fourth Kirkbride building to be constructed; it originally consisted of a single three story brick building, designed in a Gothic Revival style, and had the capacity for 250 patients. Following the Kirkbride design, the central administration floors were flanked by two patient wings, one for male and one for female. After many different expansions and additions to attempt to relieve overcrowding, the building seems to have become a confusing maze of rooms and hallways.
In 1864, Dr. Price was succeeded as superintendent by Pliny Earle, who served until 1886. Earle was recommended by noted advocate Dorothea Dix, who had made several personal visits to Northampton. While at Northampton, Earle attempted to apply the rehabilitative tenets of Moral Treatment despite the institution's ever increasing size. Earle, who was a great national voice for humane treatment of the insane. Amusement was another essential component of Moral Treatment. Together, work and amusement provided structure and a sense of
normalcy by allowing patients to engage in everyday activities they might have participated in at home. Earle arranged for extensive programs of religious and secular readings, music, lectures, and dancing as part of the patients' treatment. other recreational activities included strolling through the grounds, bowling, games, and library privileges.
When Earle resigned in 1886, he was replaced as Superintendent by his assistant Dr. Edward B. Nims, who had served since 1869. By this time, the hospital was eagerly awaiting the opening of Westborough State Hospital (see form) at the old Lyman School to absorb some of their patients and was also planning expansion of their own institution. At this time there were approximately 475 patients, a number that remained fairly constant from 1872 to 1892. For the next sixty years, however, the patient population increased rapidly, reaching 657 in 1903, 1,559 in 1928, and 2,331 in 1952. Corresponding numbers of staff were 85 in 1893, 135 in 1903, 219 in 1928, 420 in 1935, and 509 in 1952. As noted in the overview, the increases occurred as the state absorbed responsibilities from the towns and as increasing numbers of aged senile patients were admitted to insane asylums.
At the turn of the century, the now renamed Northampton State Hospital housed 600 people in overcrowded living conditions. Infirmary wings were added to both sides in 1905 and frequent additions were made since, but the hospital remained congested and the old structure was decaying quickly. By the 1950's, the patient population had peaked at over 2,500; the hospital began to serve only as a roof over the heads of the most unfortunate people, and the original ideals of ""moral treatment"" of patients were long forgotten.
In 1961, more patients were being discharged than admitted, and a slow de-institutionalization process took place in 1978 and lasted 14 years. After many treatment reform efforts and legal battles, Northampton State Hospital finally closed it's doors in 1993. During the beginning of the 21st century many of the buildings surrounding the main Kirkbride were slowly demolished. And after many failed attempts from preservation groups, the Kirkbride was finally demolished in 2007. Then, to add insult to injury, Mass Development, the company developing the former hospital site renamed it from ""Village at Hospital Hill"" to ""Village Hill Northampton"". [1][2]

Massachusetts,Penikese Island State Leper Colony,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Penikese_Island_State_Leper_Colony,,1905,,,,,,"Hansen's Disease, commonly referred to as leprosy, became a matter of public concern in the Commonwealth during the mid to late 19th century during a wave of immigration that brought people to Boston harbor from as far away as Polynesia. The disfigurement commonly associated with Hansen's disease has been a major source of fear and prejudice notwithstanding the natural immunity enjoyed by the vast majority of the population and the relative difficulty of transference. The Massachusetts State Board of Charity was the first agency in the Commonwealth explicitly tasked with the care of persons suffering from Hansen's Disease. An initial attempt to consolidate care at the State Infirmary in Tewksbury was blocked by the infirmay's administrators. As a result the Board began to look for a location for the establishment of an independent colony. In 1905, Penikese Island, located seven miles from the nearest coast in Buzzards Bay, was purchased in accordance with St 1905 c 474. Construction of four cottages, a central administration building and laundry were commenced immediately. In 1919, oversight of the Hospital was taken over by the newly formed Department of Public Health. The Hospital was closed in 1920 when the federal government assumed the responsibility of caring of people with Hansen's disease.

From 1912 to 1918, Norfolk State Hospital was responsible for providing residential care and treatment to persons committed by courts or voluntarily because of alcoholism or drug addiction.
The hospital was authorized by St 1910, c 635 as a unit of Foxborough State Hospital and established as Norfolk State Hospital under the Foxborough trustees by St 1912, c 530, with oversight by the State Board of Charity, to provide hospital treatment for ""hopeful"" cases and a detention colony for noncriminal but chronic cases. By St 1914, c 358, Foxborough State Hospital was designated as an institution for the mentally ill with a new board of trustees. The former trustees (still under the State Board of Charity) became the trustees of Norfolk State Hospital and all (male) inebriates and drug addicts, documents relating to the care of inebriates, and all records of former patients (except those committed as insane) were transferred to that institution, which began operation in June 1914. (The outpatient department of Foxborough State Hospital became a branch of Norfolk State Hospital, responsible for monitoring and advising patients who had left that facility.)
St 1918, c 139 directed the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases to transfer to Norfolk State Hospital female inmates from state hospitals for the mentally ill. However, that same year the hospital's inpatient population dwindled to forty-eight. The facility was ceded to the federal government to treat soldiers returning from World War I who were suffering from nervous and mental breakdowns, and consequently by the following year the facility had ceased to function as a state mental hospital. In the meantime St 1919, c 350, s 81 placed Norfolk State Hospital under the supervision and control of the Dept. of Mental Diseases at such a time as its lease to the federal government expired.
However, the hospital never reopened as Norfolk State Hospital. St 1922, c 535 provided that persons with alcohol and drug problems be committed to state correction facilities (including the State Farm at Bridgewater) or private treatment facilities. The hospital's buildings were used to provide immediate care and treatment for persons suffering from cancer under the authority of St 1926, c 391; in this new role the facility was named Pondville Hospital in 1927.
St 1935, c 421, which provided for a new Norfolk State Hospital for the criminally insane, was not implemented.
Pursuant to St 1926, c 391, Pondville Hospital opened in 1927 as the first state-operated hospital in Massachusetts to treat cancer patients and to do research on the prevention and cure of cancer. Under the jurisdiction of the Dept. of Public Health, it was located in buildings of the former Norfolk State Hospital in Norfolk and Walpole. Pondville provided surgical services, residency training, training in a practical nursing (from 1949), and outpatient care (St 1959, c 494). New hospital buildings were constructed in the 1960s but as the state deemphasized direct patient care, it was agreed to sell the facility to the privately owned Norwood Hospital in 1981.
It was part of the Caritas Christi Health Care System, who built a more modern complex in Foxboro and eventually shut the Southwood Hospital down. After its closure in 2003, ideas have surfaced for multiple different redevelopment plans but for environmental concerns, none have come through. In 2008, the site went up for auction with an opening bid of $10 million which was dropped to $1 million and ended at $2 million. Caritas Christi declined the final bid for the property, as it had formerly been appraised at $5 million. It would be worth a estimated $10 million if the property was not contaminated.

That same year, a large number of inmates well enough to be transferred else where were removed from the island. St. 1865, c 162 prevented cities and towns in the Commonwealth from sending sicking and contagious dependents to the hospital. The hospital was closed by order of the Governor in December of 1866.

Massachusetts,Taunton State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Taunton_State_Hospital,,1851,1854,Active,Kirkbride Plan (Demolished),Boyden & Ball,Taunton Lunatic Asylum | State Lunatic Hospital at Taunton,"It took Massachusetts until 1833 to establish its first ""lunatic system"" located in Worcester. By 1851 it had grown so dangerously overcrowded that the Legislature appropriated $100,000 for the construction of a new hospital. The Legislature appointed a commission to choose the site and oversee its construction. Interestingly, many communities across the state petitioned to have the institutions located in their towns. After a lengthy search the commission chose the City of Taunton who had raised $13,000 to buy a one hundred and fifty-four acre farm situated in the north of town.
The commission's site search was driven by specific criteria, and their vision, when the building and grounds were completed, was to ""render it a spot fitted to interest and tranquilize the minds of those who need as well the soothing influences of external nature as the healing remedies of art."" It was believed at the time that a bucolic setting of soothing topology would compliment and aid treatment. To that end, the commission settled on the farm in northern Taunton whose more than sixty acre grove, bounded by the river, extended to within a half a mile of the center of town. One advantage of the site was that the river acted as a natural barrier against the encroachments of an increasing town population, so that the institution would not gradually find itself in the heart of a large city.
The commission selected Elbridge Boyden, the most prominent New England architect of the mid-19th century, whose most famous works were Mechanics Hall and Holy Cross College, both in Worcester. He was also well-known outside of New England and was chosen to design and build Antioch College in Ohio. Boyden's specialty was the design of civic and public buildings. He built jails, courthouses, town halls, churches, hotels, banks, post offices and railroad stations all over the United States.
In 1853 the hospital was completed at a cost of $151,742.48. It was constructed in the Georgian style on a monumental scale and is, to this day, an example of classical revival institutional architecture. Boyden's specialty was the use of cast iron as a functional and decorative medium. His command of these materials can be seen in the domes, capitals and cornices that survive today. He situated the hospital ""on a gentle eminence, at the extreme northerly part of the farm, being about one mile from town."" As originally completed it was a three-storied building of brick with a slate roof. It was surmounted by a dome rising seventy feet above the roof. The dome's cupola offered a ""panoramic view of great beauty, embracing the neighboring town, with its many tokens of busy life, several flourishing villages, the numerous ponds and streams with which the surrounding country abounds, and reaching even to the blue hills of Norfolk County.""
The building boasted all of the modern conveniences: central heat, running water, sewer and central ventilation. It contained a chapel, kitchen, bakery, laundry, dining rooms, apartments for staff, washrooms, parlors, open-air verandas and ""patient"" rooms. Some patient rooms were dormitory style and others private. Private rooms were an innovation and reflected the institution's concern for its inhabitants who would now be called ""patients"" and not ""inmates.""
Today, while the Mill River still forms a barrier to the eastern boundary of the hospital the remaining 600 acres are now surrounded by the City of Taunton. The city now has 50,000 citizens. Private homes, old and new; businesses, small and large have grown around the hospital including the nationally known Reed and Barton Silver Company. At present the hospital inpatient population is only a fraction of the large number of patients who resided here in the 1940's and 50's. However, the role and vitality of the hospital have not diminished. In the 1990's there were extensive renovations which have provided modern and pleasant living environments for our patients. Taunton State Hospital currently houses 10 wards which provide long term psychiatric care and forensic evaluations for admissions that come primarily from Southeastern Massachusetts. Support is also provided to two youth service units and two adolescent wards. The hospital is a Joint Commission approved facility that serves as an intern site for Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry as well as a training site for nursing, psychology, occupational therapy and social work students. The current Chief Operating Officer is Katherine Chmiel, while the Clinical Director is Rogelio Bayog, M.D.[1]
In 1999 the large dome crowning the admin collapsed into the building. And on March 19, 2006 a huge fire gutted what was left of the administration. The burned out administration section remained until in 2009 Massachusetts demolished what remained of the kirkbride.
In 2012 Massachusetts announced that Taunton State Hospital would be closing.  A plan to keep a portion of the facility open was vetoed by Governor Deval Patrick in July 2012. Taunton State Hospital remains open and houses 48 psychiatric beds, the Women's Recovery from Addiction Program, a residential program under the Department of Youth Services, and a substance abuse program administered by High Point Treatment Center. There is also a greenhouse on the campus that is staffed by patients and sells a variety of plants and seasonal produce to the public.

The almshouses were the Commonwealth's first venture into caring for the poor, a duty which had previously been carried out by the cities and towns. Opened on May 1, 1854 with a capacity for 500, the almshouse population grew to 668 by the end of the first week, and to over 800 by May 20th. By December 2, 1854, 2,193 ""paupers"" had been admitted. Nearly 90% of these listed European countries as their birthplace. The almshouse reported having 14 employees at that time, and was spending 94.5 cents per week per resident.
In 1866 the almshouse began accepting the ""pauper insane"" becoming the state's first facility to specifically accept cases with the diagnosis of chronic insanity. By 1874 the facility had become diversified: 40% was used as a mental illness ward, 27% as a hospital ward, and 33% as an almshouse. The chronically ill population continued to grow, alcoholics were admitted for treatment, and programs providing therapeutic industrial and occupational therapy were added in the 1870's. A Home Training School for Nurses was established in 1894, and the school became a full-fledged three-year program in 1898.
The most famous patient in the almshouse during the 19th century was Anne Sullivan, who later became the tutor and companion of Helen Keller. Anne Sullivan spent four years at the almshouse (1876-1880) before being transferred to the Perkins School for the Blind, now located in Watertown, Massachusetts. At age 20 she left the school to go to Helen Keller's home in Alabama. One of the buildings on today's Tewksbury Hospital Campus is named for Ms. Sullivan.
Reflecting its changing mission, the Tewksbury Almshouse became Tewksbury State Hospital in 1900, the Massachusetts State Infirmary in 1909, and Tewksbury State Hospital and Infirmary in 1938. Over the years, facilities were added for treating tuberculosis and other contagious diseases such as smallpox, venereal diseases and typhoid fever. Meanwhile it continued to serve as a last resort for many patients in need of shelter and supervised care, especially during the late 1920's and 1930's.[1]

There are three cemeteries on the grounds of Tewksbury Hospital with at least 10,000 graves in them. The cemetery directory dates back to 1891 and contains 9,342 names. Patients who died between 1854 and 1891 are not recorded, so the total number of graves is not known. The grave markers, three-inch high metal circles with crosses in the middle, are rusted and easy to miss because of the overgrowth of weeds. Although on occasion community groups have done some clearing of overgrowth in the cemeteries, the hospital has no money in its budget for regular maintenance.

Massachusetts,Westborough State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Westborough_State_Hospital,1884,,1887,Demolished,Cottage Plan,"Elias Carter & James Savage/Kendall, Taylor & Stevens",Westborough Insane Asylum,"The Brigham Farm, later the Peter Farm, was purchased in 1846 for the State Reform School, later the State Hospital (1885). The Westborough State Hospital was established by Chapter 322 of the Acts of 1884 as the Westborough Insane Hospital. In a major departure from other state hospitals, its trustees were not directed to find a new site and make plans for new buildings, but rather to develop a scheme to reuse the structures recently vacated by the State Reform School for Boys. The site, which by then totaled 275
acres, had been developed around the 180-acre former farmstead of Lovett Peters, Esq., and adjacent acreage owned by the Rice family.
George Clough of Boston was engaged to remodel the building which had housed 400-500 boys and had been declared unfit for reform school purposes due to its large size and jail-like appearance. To adapt the building for occupancy by 325 ""insane"" patients, Clough demolished the center of the existing building, which dated from 1876, and replaced
it with a gambrel roof section housing a congregate dining room on its first floor with a chapel above. The alterations began on May 18, 1885, and were apparently complete by
December 1, 1886, when a reception was held for Governor George D. Robinson. A few days later, the first 204 patients (almost all chronic cases who were able to pay for their treatment) were received from Worcester, and then Danvers, Taunton, and Northampton. In the meantime, Dr. N. Emmons Paine, formerly assistant physician at the State Homeopathic Asylum for the Insane in Middletown, New York, had been appointed Superintendent and had begun to formulate the hospital's unique program of treatment along with the Board of Trustees. Two years later, Dr. Paine was appointed as lecturer in insanity at the Boston University Medical School.
Unlike its contemporaries in Massachusetts, Westborough was to be run according to homeopathic principles, which emphasized rest (sometimes enforced), massage, hydrotherapy, and special diet while avoiding use of available hypnotics and sedatives like morphine, opium, iromide, and chloral. This did not mean that drug therapy was totally ignored,
since milder antispasmodics like belladonna, hyoscyamus, stramonium, and veratrin were occasionally administered for mania and restlessness. Bedrest and massage were thought to be particularly useful for patients admitted with melancholia or in a debilitated condition. Hydrotherapy, consisting of graduated spray baths, graduated tub baths, cold sponging, and wetpacks, was felt to be of use for all acute cases.
At the turn of the century, several buildings and groups of buildings were erected specifically for acute or chronic cases. First was the Hospital for Acute Cases, located east of the Main Hospital. During the early twentieth century, the hospital's acreage expanded to 650 acres, much of it prime agricultural land. As was the case at other institutions, the farm provided valuable work therapy opportunities as well as a steady supply of food.
The Westborough Insane Hospital was officially renamed as the Westborough State Hospital in 1907 in accordance with a systemwide initiative. As was typical here and nationally, a wide variety of new programs aimed at research, general health, prevention, and outpatient services were established. When the Governor & Council's committee visited Westborough in 1945, the patient population had swelled to 1,730, well over the normal capacity of 1,332. At the same time, the staffing level was at a low of 239, with 210 vacancies due to the effects of World War II. Many buildings were seriously overcrowded, and several, including the old 1848 Lyman School, were noted as firetraps. A few criminally
insane women were among the inmates, and due to lack of proper accommodations, had killed an unspecified number of other patients in recent months.
The hospital was closed in 2010, in anticipation of a new Worcester State Hospital opening in 2012. Almost all of the buildings at Westborough State Hospital were demolished in 2019.

Ward P. Delano",Massachussets State Hospital | Worcester State Instane Asylum | State Lunatic Asylum at Worcester | Bloomingdale Insane Asylum | Worcester Insane Hospital,"Also once known as the Worcester Lunatic Asylum and the Bloomingdale Asylum, this psychiatric facility's history dates back to before the main building was built. On January 12, 1833, the old Worcester Insane Asylum opened, and was the first of its kind constructed in the state of Massachusetts. When overcrowding became a problem, a new hospital was to be built - a massive structure laid out in the Kirkbride plan.
Construction began in 1870 and the newly built Worcester State Hospital opened seven years later. Designed by architect Ward P. Delano of the firm Fuller & Delano of Worcester, the flagstone and brick building stood four stories tall, and between the 500 foot wings stood a beautiful clock tower, looming above the central administration building. On an interesting note, Sigmund Freud visited the hospital in 1909 during his only trip to America.
A massive fire engulfed the Kirkbride building on July 22, 1991, destroying almost all of the roof and floors, save for the right most wing and the administration building. The burned out shells of the other areas were bulldozed and the extra stone was used to seal up the gaping holes left by the connections to the remaining sections. A new hospital building was built behind the remains of the Kirkbride building and is still in operation as of 2023.
In the spring of 2008 the remaining wing segments of the Kirkbride building were demolished, along with the one of the historic rotundas and employee residences. The demolition is to make room for a new state psychiatric hospital.
On the 23d of February, 1829, Horace Mann, of Dedham, in behalf of a committee of the House of Representatives, appointed to consider the subject of the presence of considerable numbers of insane persons in the community who were either cared for in their own homes or in jails and almshouses, reported orders for the appointment of a committee ""to examine and ascertain the practicability and expediency of erecting or procuring, at the expense of the commonwealth, an asylum for the safekeeping of lunatics and persons furiously mad,"" and requiring the selectmen of the several towns to ascertain and make returns to the Secretary of the commonwealth of the "" number, age, sex and color of all persons reputed to be lunatics and furiously mad belonging to their respective towns, and whether at large or in confinement, and where and how long confined""—which orders were subsequently adopted by the House, and Messrs. Mann, Loud, of Dorchester, and Denny, of Leicester, were appointed to constitute said committee.
Meanwhile, in pursuance of the authority given, the trustees appointed as first superintendent of the new institution Samuel B. Woodward, M. D., of Wethersfield, Conn. Dr. Samuel Bayard Woodward was the son of a physician and a native of Connecticut, born on June 10, 1787, and licensed to practice medicine at the age of 21. His attention was called to this special department of the profession by the occurrence of several cases of insanity in his own practice and in that of his professional brethren whose adviser he was. The difficulty of managing these cases in their private practice led Dr. Woodward and his particular friend, Dr. Eli Todd, to take the first step towards the establishment of the Retreat for the Insane at Hartford, and he took credit to himself in having secured for it its present delightful location. He was appointed superintendent of the State Lunatic Hospital at Worcester, Mass., in September, 1832; went to Worcester in December following, and moved into the hospital as soon as rooms could be finished and furnished for the reception of his family. He retired on June 30, 1846, on account of failing health, and moved to Northampton, Mass., where he died quite suddenly on the evening of January 3, 1850.
That the hospital filled a public need was shown by the rapid influx of patients. In their report of December 31, 1833, the trustees stated that the hospital was then in a very crowded condition and that many applications for admission had been necessarily rejected because of lack of accommodations. Immediate measures were taken to increase the capacity of the institution and on April 7, 1835, the sum of $25,000 was appropriated for the enlargement of the hospital. Later in the session an appropriation of $3000 was made for the erection of a chapel and $7000 for the purchase of additional land for the use of the hospital. This increase in capacity was soon followed by others and at the time of the retirement of Dr. Woodward the patients in the hospital numbered 360—three times the amount of the accommodation furnished at the erection of the original building.
In their choice of Dr. Samuel B. Woodward as their first superintendent the trustees were singularly fortunate. Under his wise and humane administration the treatment of the insane in this hospital, one of the early state institutions in this country, was placed at once upon a high level.
Following the resignation of Dr. Woodward, Dr. George Chandler was appointed superintendent of the State Lunatic Hospital on July 1, 1846. Dr. Chandler began practice in Worcester in 1831 and a few years later was appointed assistant physician at the State Lunatic Hospital at Worcester. From 1842 to 1845 he was superintendent of the insane hospital at Concord, N. H. With this experience Dr. Chandler came well equipped for his work. His administration of affairs was successful. He was a good manager and in many ways improved the institution's equipment. He lighted the hospital with gas, introduced steam heating and greatly improved the ventilation. He did considerable in the way of educational instruction of the patients. He increased the capacity of the institution to keep pace with the ever-increasing numbers of the insane. As early as 1847 Dr. Chandler called attention in his reports to the increasing numbers of foreign born among the insane, showing the influence of immigration in the filling of our hospitals.
When the institution was first established its location was considered sufficiently removed from the residence center of the town to be unobjectionable. With the growth of the community the town steadily encroached upon the hospital and there began to be a feeling in the minds of many that another site should be found, to which the institution should be later transferred. Dr. Chandler suggested that it would be wise to consider a relocation at a more remote point.
Dr. Chandler resigned his superintendency April 1, 1856. After his retirement to private life he spent his time in travel and in biographical work. He died May 17, 1893, at the age of 97 years.
Succeeding Dr. Chandler, Dr. Merrick Bemis was promoted from the office of assistant physician, which he had acceptably filled, to that of superintendent. Under Dr. Bemis the good traditions of the hospital were preserved. He proved an efficient and capable man. He, like his predecessors, constantly enlarged the institution in response to the public need. He placed great stress on occupation in the treatment of mental disease and lessened restraint and seclusion. He employed the first female physician. The removal of the institution from its original location was again actively agitated, and in 1869 Dr. Bemis, under the direction of the trustees, bonded land in the outskirts of the town, on a site overlooking Lake Quinsigamond. The Legislature approving, the land was purchased the next year. The plan of the new institution, as formulated by Dr. Bemis, was ambitious and ideal. He advocated a central hospital plant for the actively disturbed, giving accommodation to perhaps onethird of the cases. The remaining two-thirds, the quiet and the convalescent, he proposed to care for in groups of 15 to 20, located in separate cottages. This would provide a family care approaching the more natural life in the community.
After a service of 24 years as assistant physician and afterwards as superintendent, Dr. Bemis resigned from the public service and established a small private hospital in Worcester. He also conducted a private practice in the community. He lived to a ripe old age, dying October 3, 1904.
The trustees elected as superintendent to succeed Dr. Bemis, Dr. Bernard D. Eastman, first assistant physician at the National Hospital, Washington, and formerly assistant physician at Concord, N. H. Upon Dr. Eastman, with the assistance of the architect, Mr. Rand, devolved the task of the preparation of plans for the erection of the proposed new hospital in the suburbs. These plans struck "" a happy medium between the older fashioned system of aggregation and the theoretical system of segregation.""
On February 6, 1879, Dr. Eastman resigned from the superintendency of the hospital. He later went to Kansas and was long identified with the insane hospital at Topeka.
Dr. John G. Park, formerly assistant physician at the hospital and later superintendent of the Asylum for the Chronic Insane, assumed the superintendency of the hospital on March 1, 1879. His administration perfected the organization of the service in the new hospital buildings and did much in the improvement of the grounds. He took a deep interest in the physical activities of his patients and recognized occupation as one of the best and most important of remedial measures. He introduced various industrial activities, as spinning, knitting, the use of the hand weaving loom and other forms of employment. He early advocated the establishment of a separate institution for the male criminal insane. The continued increase in numbers of patients necessitated the still further enlargement of the institution. Dr. Park erected the two circular observation wards, which have proven so well adapted for their purpose. During his administration the Hillside Farm, of 130 acres, in the town of Shrewsbury, was purchased to provide pasturage for the increasing herds.
In September, 1890, Dr. Park resigned his position as superintendent. After his retirement from this institution he served as chairman of the commission which erected the buildings of the Medfield State Asylum. Later, with the occupancy of the buildings, he was appointed to the Board of Trustees of that asylum, which office he held at the time of his death on August 9, 1905.
Dr. Hosea M. Quinby assumed the superintendency of the hospital on November 25, 1890. Dr. Quinby was previously assistant physician at the hospital and superintendent of the Worcester Asylum from 1879 to 1890. During his administration a farm building was erected for the accommodation of working patients, two nurses' homes built, infirmary buildings and a bath house completed, the domestic departments added to and the capacity of the institution generally increased, the number of patients rising from 785 to 1401.
One of the chief contributions of Dr. Quinby to the improvement of the care of the insane and the study of insanity was the employment of a special pathologist and clinician, who reorganized the record-taking and the general methods of examination and study of insanity. A training school for assistant physicians was organized, which was highly successful and attracted many capable men to the service of the institution. A laboratory building was erected to provide special facilities for scientific research in connection with the care and treatment of the insane. Dr. Quinby was also greatly interested in the development and beautifying of the grounds and conducted this work with much ability. April 1, 1912, he retired from the service to the enjoyment of private life.
April 1, 1912, Dr. Ernest V. Scribner, formerly assistant physician at the hospital, and more lately for some years superintendent of the Worcester State Asylum, succeeded Dr. Quinby as superintendent of the hospital and is now in office.
During the life of the institution 113 different persons figured as assistant physicians in its service. Some of these men have achieved renown in their chosen specialty. To enter in any way into their individual histories would exceed the proper limits of this brief account. Suffice it to say that nearly a score have risen to the management of institutions.[1]
New buildings continued to be constructed at the hospital through out the early parts of the 20th century. The large Kirkbride building reminded in use until a massive fire engulfed the building on July 22, 1991. The fire destroyed almost the entire building with exception of the right most wing and the administration building. The burned sections were bulldozed and the extra stone was used to seal up the gaping holes left by the connections to the still remaining sections. After the fire patients were moved to other buildings on the campus and the hospital continued to operate. In 2004 a proposal to build a new hospital was put into the works.[2]  In 2008, there were plans to film the movie Shutter Island on the grounds of the hospital, but because of the pending demolition and construction of the new hospital, filming was not approved and instead took place at Medfield State Hospital. In 2008 the remaining remaining wing of the Kirkbride was demolished to make room for the new hospital. the remaining administration section was demolished but the bricks were used to make a clock tower as a memorial.
In May 2009, Worcester saw the funds approved for the construction of a new Worcester State Hospital. A new 320-bed psychiatric hospital serving individuals from all parts of the Commonwealth is now in construction. The innovative design will provide an environment of care that maximizes the effectiveness of clinical and rehabilitation staff, allowing the facility to operate at an optimum ratio of staff to patients. The building’s plan will reflect the stages of recovery: by using familiar environments, ranging from “house” to “neighborhood” to “downtown.” A secure facility, outdoor courts relate to each living unit, and the “downtown” surrounds a central “village green” shared by all. The low-rise scale will serve to emphasize the residential character, and minimize the stigma attached to psychiatric facilities. This new facility will enable DMH to close two antiquated facilities, parts of which date to the 19th century, thereby dramatically reducing future operating and capital expenses. With the significant advances in the field of psychiatric care, which are reducing the number of people who need long term care, this building may become the central psychiatric care facility for the entire state.[3][4]

Massachusetts,Belchertown State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Belchertown_State_School,,1922,1915,Closed,Cottage Plan,"Kendall, Taylor & Co.",Belchertown State School for the Feeble-Minded,"The Belchertown State School for the Feeble-Minded was established in 1922 in Belchertown, Massachusetts. Located at 30 State Street, the 876-acre (3.55 km2) campus contains ten major buildings built in a Colonial Revival style by Kendall, Taylor, and Co. The state schools of Massachusetts were different from state hospitals; the latter was for the mentally ill, while state schools were institutions for the mentally defective (the name is a misnomer, as they did not generally involve any form of education).
Throughout its first 40 years, Belchertown operated mostly without scrutiny from outside sources. It was later discovered that since its inception the residents—some of whom had lived on the wards their entire lives—were being terribly mistreated and abused by the staff; author Benjamin Ricci referred to the conditions there as ""horrific"", ""medieval"" , and ""barbaric"".
Doctors at the school had little regard for patients' mental capacity, evidenced by this quote:
""His method of evaluating me consisted of looking me over during the physical exam and deciding that since I couldn't talk and apparently couldn't understand what he was saying, I must be an imbecile. Since I couldn't ask him to speak up or repeat what he said, he assumed I was a moron. (Sienkewicz-Mercer p38)""
Attendants on the wards were overworked, with dozens of patients in each ward, and as a result their treatment of the residents was nothing short of atrocious. Because there was not enough time for proper toilet care, residents were left ""half-naked rolling in their own excrement"".
Those who were severely physically handicapped were left in their beds the entire day, without any form of entertainment. Patients who were unable to feed themselves were force-fed by the attendants (Sienkewicz-Mercer, p. 42), and when it was necessary to move a patient they did so roughly, causing injuries to the patient. As a result of this gross mistreatment, some patients were prone to ""moaning in the hallways"", ""reaching into (their) diapers and spreading whatever (they) found all over, repeatedly banging their heads against the walls"" (Sienkewicz-Mercer, p. 50), or any of a number of other responses. Additionally, the facility suffered from vermin infestation.
The reason for this situation was partly due to the prevailing cultural perspective of what was often called ""mental deficiency"". Around the turn of the 20th century, many people with handicaps were simply kept at home when possible. This changed in the 1920s and 1930s because state governments and bureaucracies developed special divisions to manage these individuals—in Massachusetts and elsewhere, this was the role of the Department of Mental Retardation. In addition, expertise on ""the infirm"" became a specialty in the medical world, which in turn helped shape social policy. And while few parents would want to send their child to live in squalor and suffer abuse, many felt they had no other choice as there was simply nowhere else for a child with severe disabilities to go.
Beginning in the Kennedy administration, and partly due to the civil rights movement started by African Americans, awareness of disabled people as individuals with human rights increased. In 1966 Massachusetts passed the Mental Health and Retardation Services Act, which mandated a gradual transition from a few institutions around the state to a more community-based system of care facilities. The horrendous conditions at Belchertown were revealed in 1971 in a newspaper article entitled ""The Tragedy of Belchertown."" Parents sued the school, and when the state Attorney General toured the facility, he described it as ""a hell hole.""
This was the first lawsuit against a state school, and others followed in Massachusetts for the next few years. In 1975, Belchertown was sued once again for denying its patients the right to vote (this was one of the first disability-related voting rights cases in the United States), and in 1977 a case was brought against the school on behalf of a 67-year-old severely retarded man with leukemia to determine if a court appointed guardian ad litem could refuse treatment on his behalf.
After hobbling along for several more years, Belchertown was finally closed in 1992; two years later it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. More recent improvements have been the makeover of Foley Field into a baseball diamond for the local Little League team, and restoration of the overgrown cemetery (with numbers marking the graves) to appear cleaner and properly memorialize dead patients by name. In 2001, a town meeting designated the school property as an Economic Opportunity Area for 20 years. This economic development plan provides tax incentives to businesses who establish themselves on the site.
For more information about Belchertown, there is a book entitled Crimes Against Humanity: A Historical Perspective. It was written by Benjamin Ricci, who sent his six-year-old son Bobby to live there not knowing what the conditions were like, and who was involved in the initial 1972 lawsuit. Another book with vivid descriptions of Belchertown is Ruth Sienkiewicz-Mercer's I Raise My Eyes to Say Yes; she was a resident of the school in the 1960s and 1970s. Sienkiewicz-Mercer's book refers to a young male nurse who worked at Belchertown in the late 1960s and early 1970s who later became a junior senator from Massachusetts. His name, she says, was John Kerry. An interesting statement, since Senator Kerry graduated from Yale in 1966, and served in the U.S. Navy from 1966 to 1970.[1]",1992,"Belchertown, MA","Bungalow/Craftsman, Colonial Revival, Italianate",
Massachusetts,Fernald State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Fernald_State_School,,1848,1848 (Original location)/1887,Closed,Cottage Plan,"William G. Preston, Clarence P. Hoyt",School for the Feeble Minded | Massachusetts School for Idiotic Children | Massachusetts School for the Feeble Minded | Walter E. Fernald State School,"Social reformer Samuel Gridley Howe founded the school in 1848 with a $2,500 appropriation from the Legislature. Records of Dr. Howe and the beginnings of mental retardation services in the United States reside in Fernald’s Howe Library. Under its first resident superintendent, Walter E. Fernald (1887-1924), the school became a model educational facility in the field of mental retardation. In 1925, the Legislature passed a bill officially naming the school the Walter E. Fernald State School. In it's later years it became involved with various experiments that came to light in the 1990's where doctors at the hospital were conducting radiation experiments on the patients living there. It is slowly closing due to an ever decreasing patient population.
The Walter E. Fernald State School, the oldest institution for the retarded in the country, began operation in Massachusetts in 1848 as the Experimental School for Teaching and Training Idiotic Children.
Prior to the establishment of the school, the governor had appointed three Commissioners of Idiocy to inquire on the ""condition of idiots in the commonwealth and if anything can be done for them"" (Resolves 1846, c 117). The commission's report, written by Samuel G. Howe of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind led to an experimental school being funded for three years by the state (Resolves 1848, c 65) and administered by the trustees of the Perkins Institution. The legislature incorporated it as the Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded? Youth in 1850 (St 1850, c 150).
Resolves 1855, c 58 appropriated funds for a permanent facility, a site for which was found in South Boston. From 1863 the school was under the supervision successively of the Board of State Charities (1863-1879), the State Board of Health, Lunacy, and Charity (1879-1886), and the State Board of Lunacy and Charity (1886-1898), to whom it made quarterly census reports. By St 1898, c 433, s 9 it was placed within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Insanity.
The name of the school was changed to the Massachusetts School for the Feeble- Minded by St 1883, c 239, which provided that pupils were to be supported by quarterly payments from their place of settlement (in turn reimbursed by the state), expenses of those who had no place of settlement were to be paid by the state, commitments were to be made through probate or municipal court, trustees could receive or discharge students at their discretion, and that there be established as a separate department of the school an asylum for those who were beyond school age or not capable of being helped by the school's instruction. St 1886, c 298 further provided that indigent persons designated by the governor and special pupils from other states could be received, persons applying for the commitment of others must first notify the appropriate mayor or selectmen, trustees were to make an annual report to the state Board of Education, and the State Board of Lunacy and Charity could transfer a person from one of its institutions to the school.
By 1887 the school needed to expand and consequently Resolves 1887, c 64 and Resolves 1888, c 82 provided funds for the construction of a facility in Waltham. Occupation of the Waltham site began in 1890 and the South Boston facility was closed in 1892. Throughout the 1890s the legislature continued to appropriate money for the purchase of land surrounding the school and the construction of additional buildings.
To counter problems with students sent by their communities who were either delinquent, violent, or insane, St 1906, c 309 provided that anyone incapable of further instruction at the school could be sent to another institution if adjudged other than feeble-minded by the courts. St 1906, c 508 increased the number of trustees appointed by the governor to seven, two of whom could be women, and the trustees were to appoint a superintendent who was to be a medical doctor and to reside at the school and also assistant physicians, one of whom was required to be a woman. The trustees were to visit the school at least once a month and report on conditions there.
The responsibility for supporting the students at the school was removed from the communities in 1908, with the Commonwealth being liable for their board, care, and treatment (St 1908, c 629). In 1909 a recodification of laws relating to insane persons provided for twelve trustees for the school, six of whom were to be appointed by the governor. It also allowed for voluntary admission on application by a parent or guardian with medical certification, in addition to customary commitment by the courts (St 1909, c 504, ss 59-65).
Early in 1915 the State Board of Insanity urged the school to start outpatient work, which in fact it had already begun. Clinics were started in Worcester, Fall River, and Haverhill, with the hope that the advice and help given in the communities through these clinics would save the Commonwealth some of the expense of institutional care. By 1921 the school was one of several state institutions operating traveling clinics to diagnose children in accordance with the provisions of St 1919, c 277, which required school committees to provide special education to mentally retarded pupils within the public school system.
On the abolition of the State Board of Insanity in 1916, the Massachusetts School for the Feeble-Minded? came successively under the jurisdiction of the Commission on Mental Diseases (St 1916, c 285), the Department of Mental Diseases (St 1919, c 350, ss 79-80), and the Department of Mental Health (St 1938, c 486). In 1925, a year after the death of long-time superintendent Walter E. Fernald, the legislature renamed the institution the Walter E. Fernald State School (St 1925, c 293).
The 1960s brought two changes of note the school. In 1963 a work program was established (St 1963, c 394) in which certain students, known as patient trainees, were chosen at the discretion of the superintendent and paid for work performed at the school. In 1966 legislation provided for a comprehensive program of mental health and mental retardation services (St 1966, c 735) under the Department of Mental Health. Section 14 of the act stated that trustees of the Fernald School and those of similar state institutions were to establish and maintain, subject to appropriation, research and demonstration projects in vocational rehabilitation in cooperation with the federal vocational rehabilitation program.
One result of federal-state cooperation was the creation of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center at the Fernald School. The Shriver Center was built with matching state and federal funds as detailed in Public Law 88-164. The Shriver Center includes a Community Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center, which provides training for people working with the retarded, in areas such as biochemistry, genetics, and occupational therapy, and is associated with several local institutions of higher education. There is also a Research and Special Services Building, which was one of twelve research centers created in the nation by PL 88-164. The research building, in addition to its research activities, has been designated as a state-wide resource for the retarded.
The mental health and mental retardation services in Massachusetts were reorganized in 1986. A Department of Mental Retardation was created (St 1986, c 599), which supervises and controls all public facilities for the retarded including the Fernald School and is currently under the jurisdiction of the Executive Office of Human Services.[1]
As of November 29, 2014, the facility has been closed. The state sold the property to the city of Waltham in 2014 for $3.7 million, retaining some rights to profit from future leases and with some historical preservation conditions. As of 2020, despite considering use of the property as a high school or police station, it remains vacant.
It has been speculated that this school was one of the schools showcased in the expose book Christmas in Purgatory by Burton Blatt and Fred Kaplan. Burton Blatt never publicly announced what the other four schools in the book were. He said that he would rather the pictures in the book be looked as current conditions in every state school instead of a select few in the North East.

Epileptic children are received and treated, and orthopedic cases requiring a long treatment.
At the beginning of the official year the institution contained 63 children ; at the close of the year the number had increased to 86. There are accommodations for about 125. The buildings are well planned and constructed, and the management of the unfortunate inmates is kind and judicious.
This Institution was incorporated and opened in 1882. The Legislature of 1887 appropriated the sum of $10,000 for the payment of its debts, the purchase of land, and other objects; and at the same time authorized the State Board of Lunacy and Charity to send to the Institution  the aggregate number of ten children and no more, afflicted with epilepsy or other chronic diseases, to be maintained free of expense to the Commonwealth for the term of one year from the date of their respective admissions thereto,"" it being provided that the children selected should be approved by the Trustees and Superintendent of the Corporation, and it being also provided that two of the Trustees should be appointed by the Governor and Council. The Legislature of 1889 made an appropriation of $55,000, to be expended in the erection of three brick buildings,according to plans approved by the Governor and Council, and provided that such number of children should be maintained at the Institution, without expense to the Commonwealth,as the State Board and the Trustees should agree upon. The Legislature of 1890 appropriated the further sum of$30,000 for completing and furnishing the buildings, on the condition that a majority of the Trustees should be appointed by the Governor and Council. The Legislature of 1892 provided for the appointment of Trustees by the Governor and Council. The classes of cases cared for are :
1. Those under fourteen years of age suffering from epileptic or epileptic form seizures.
2. Children suffering from other nervous disorders, not feeble-minded.
3. Children with deformities, with disease of hip, knee and other joints, spinal disease, infantile paralysis and other affections where the disorder is likely to require a long residence in a hospital.
4. Cases needing operation or fitting of supports, where this may be done by a residence of a few weeks or less.In such cases the children return to their homes as soon as the appliances are fitted, and are brought to the Hospital at intervals for observation.
At the beginning of the official year the Institution contained 86 children; at the close of the year there were 97.
Of the latter 60 were epileptics, 6 had hip disease, 6 infantile paralysis, 12 cerebral paralysis, and the remainder different diseases requiring hospital treatment.
The new buildings of the Institution are well adapted to their purpose, the management is excellent, and the children receive true home care and attention. Two recent epidemics of scarlet fever emphasize the need of a stricter quarantine of new arrivals.

The same authorized two other state sanatoria at Lakeville and Westfield. The sanatorium at North Reading opened in September of 1909. The following year it was formally named and placed under the authority of the Trustees of Hospitals for Consumptives (St 1910, c 198 and c 491), which was superseded in 1919 by the Division of Sanatoria, a division of the Department of Public Health (St 1919, c 350, s 98).

The State Primary School opened at the almshouse in 1866 and continued after its closing until 1895, providing lodging, instruction, and employment for dependent and neglected children under age sixteen without settlement in the Commonwealth and some juvenile offenders. In 1879 there was a total of 443 children, 99 of whom were females between the ages of 5 and 12. Children participated in work-related activities, including sewing, laundry and farming. Studies in school included bible stories, Edward’s 1st-4th Reader, geography, arithmetic, writing, grammar, physiology and history. Discipline was as parental as possible. Children were subsequently adopted, indentured or fostered out of the institution.
Beginning in 1895, the physical plant of the institution was reconstructed as part of its conversion into the Massachusetts State Hospital for Epileptics. The old almshouse, which was essentially a frame reconstruction of the 1848 reformatory in Westborough, was torn down and replaced by a series of brick cottages intended for the treatment of epilepsy. From the outset, most patients at the hospital also suffered from related intellectual disabilities and mental illness. This prompted a gradual shift in focus over the course of the century. By the late 60's, Monson Developmental Center. as the facility came to be known. exclusively provided services to the intellectually disabled who were also suffering related health and mobility issues.
The Hospital's closing was announced in December 2008 as part of a cost-cutting move and a push by the state to relocate developmentally disabled residents into community-based group homes, intended to mirror home environments more closely. At that time, there were 137 severely disabled residents living there, and 403 employees. The campus was fully closed in June 2012. In 2017, the state opened a request for proposals for redevelopment of about 256 acres, representing most of the previously developed portion of the land.

Dr. Fernald and the Trustees first requested such a colony in 1896 to provide a useful and happy living situation for trained adult males with no prospect of an outside living situation. The new site was described as a territory three miles long by one mile wide, containing seventeen parcels of land, and encompassing three hills rising over 1,200 feet.
Within two years, the Templeton Farm had a patient population of 99, living in three colonies: Farm, Narragansett, and Eliot. By 1904, 200 acres had been cleared for a fourth colony: Brook. During the next few years, great progress continued to be made, further realizing Dr. Fernald's dream of cultivating the wilderness. In 1904, fifty acres were put under cultivation, with an additional twenty sown for fodder. Another twenty acres produced 2,000 bushels of potatoes along with 400 barrels of apples. Similar progress was reported in 1906 when seventeen acres of woodland were cleared, forty-six acres were planted with corn for fodder, and the farm produced 3,700 bushels of potatoes, fourteen
tons of squash, and enough other vegetables to fill eleven carloads for shipment to Waltham. The boys were described as ""contented, happy, and have developed self-respect"".
The acreage and agricultural productivity of Templeton continued to grow in the pre-World War II period. In 1912, the campus was expanded with 64 additional acres bought at $10 per acre with private funds. Building improvements continued as well. An on-site freight station was erected in 1912 to obviate the six-mile trip to Baldwinville. In 1922, Brook House was destroyed by fire, but a new recreation building/assembly hall was erected by the staff and patients for $5,000.  In 1938 Templeton was finally brought into the
modern age with construction of a new water and sewerage system to replace wells, and an electric power plant began to supply light and steam heat, replacing kerosene lamps, fires, and stoves.
The Governor & Council Report of 1945 considered Templeton, along with it's parent institution the Fernald School, to be outstanding in their work among children. It was noted that the Templeton farm was staffed with 30 paid employees and 250 patients, and that it produced abundant food for its own uses and for Fernald. There were 300 acres under cultivation, 15 milking cows with 120 head of young cattle being raised to supplement the herd, a small piggery, and no poultry. A brief internal history notes that the Templeton Colony achieved national recognition for its agricultural production between the 1930s and the 1960s. It raised the largest oxen in the world in 1959, and by 1960 was second in the
united States in milk production. During this period the residential population peaked at 370 with a staff of 94. In 1967 a new sewerage system was installed, and several new dormitories were added to Narragansett Colony.

Massachusetts,Wrentham State School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Wrentham_State_School,,1906,1907,Active,Cottage Plan,Kendall & Taylor,Wrentham Developmental Center,"The Wrentham State School was built in 1906 in Wrentham, Massachusetts for the purpose of reducing the crowding at the Walter E. Fernald School in Waltham. The original campus was built out of nine converted family farm houses on 500 acres of land. Dr. George L. Wallace, the original Superintendent, accepted 10 boys who were transferred from Fernald to the new land in Wrentham in January of 1907. He proposed to have a total of 60 boys there by that summer.[1] Wallace, like many other Massachusetts mental health physicians at the time, followed the teachings of Dr. Samuel G. Howe of Boston. Howe believed in teaching and training of the mentally disabled, and preparing them for integration into society, rather than segregating them from the general population. [2] In the early years of the facility, able bodied young men with developmental disabilities were brought to the school to do farm work, and to learn skills of manual labor.
As the school accepted more patients, both male and female, ranging in age and degree of disability, reports of abuse and scandal became ongoing at Wrentham. A 1973 lawsuit ""Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens vs. Dukakis"" claimed constitutional rights of patients at the facility had been violated based on the living conditions. [3] The school's certification was revoked in 1976 due to the facility's ""inability to meet minimum Federal Standards."" The peak population was 1448 men, women and children. Overcrowded, understaffed, and underfunded, the conditions for patients were deplorable.[4] There were reports of fluoride and radiation testing on patients there, and Federal Judge Joseph Tauro branded the facility ""an absolute disgrace and a nightmare"" after a tour of the school in spring of 1977. [5]
With the abuse accusations, numerous lawsuits against the school, and the onset of deinstitutionalization, many patients were moved into group homes in the late 1970's and early 1980's. The population of the school declined, and the living conditions improved for those who still remained at Wrentham. The name was changed to the Wrentham Developmental Center some time in the 1990's. The focus of the school was no longer to train the young and disabled for the real world, but to serve was a safe place for the aging population to live out the rest of their days.
The school was added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 1994. (#93001490)[6]
The facility is still open, caring for the developmentally disabled in a group home environment. Patients are aged 30-90, and are all housed on the rural campus. New admissions are not being accepted, unless patients are transferred from another closing facility. [7] Several facilities have transferred patients to Wrentham upon their closure, including Glavin Regional Center in 2009.[8]

Massachusetts,Boston Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Boston_Sanatorium,,,1907,Preserved,Rambling Plan,Maginnis & Walsh and James Richie,Boston Consumptives Hospital,"The City of Boston established the Boston Sanatorium, first known as Consumptives Hospital, for the care of indigent persons suffering from advanced tuberculosis, one of six hospitals created in the first decade of the 20th century to provide additional services for the city’s poor. The 51-acre campus along the Neponset River enabled the city to isolate highly contagious tubercular patients from the general population at the same time that it could provide them with clean air and a spacious outdoor setting away from the crowded city. The Boston firm of Magginis and Walsh laid out the campus and designed the original hospital buildings between 1907-1920. The architects located the sprawling E-shaped Hospital Ward complex behind the stately Main Administration Building on a rocky hill, where patients could best take advantage of healthful breezes coming off the nearby bay. Built of concrete, an unusual material for such a formal structure of the period, the Hospital Ward displays considerable architectural merit. In 1929, the hospital’s mission broadened to include treatment of impoverished persons with all manners of health needs.
In 1929, with the ambitious expansion of the sanatorium's physical plant well underway, the hospital's program and policies were reorganized in anticipation of the complex's change of function from a hospital with the narrow focus of caring for persons with advanced cases of Tuberculosis to a much larger facility charged with the care of impoverished persons with all stages of this disease. It was noted in the Annual Report of the Hospital Department for 1929 that ""in other words, our function has been enlarged from an asylum for the dying to that of a true sanatorium."" This report voiced concerns about the hospital's inability to attract a well-trained permanent staff, remarking on this campuses lack of proximity to downtown Boston ,""wretched"" living quarters for the staff and the continual problem of medical interns appointed for only short periods of time. Evidently, the expansion of the old buildings and the construction of new staff living quarters served to alleviate many of the problems cited in the 1929 Annual Report. In 1930, the staff of the Sanatorium treated 835 persons suffering from Tuberculosis. This figure represents an increase of patients from the previous year. By 1933, the Boston Sanatorium complex was substantially complete. By that year a total of 21 buildings were situated on the sanatorium's grounds essentially representing the greatest extent of its growth.
In 1999 the Boston Redevelopment Authority and Boston Public Health Commission selected Trinity Financial, Inc. to redevelop 27 acres of this site. Phase I, which involves rehabilitating the Foley Building into 98 units of senior housing and the E-building to house Entra Familia's young mother's substance abuse program, is underway. Phase I cost $19 million and was completed February 2003. Phase II involved rehabilitating buildings at the rear of the campus, including the monumental Hospital Ward, into approximately 124 senior residential units.",1982,"Mattapan, Boston, MA",,

In 1884 after 12 years of riots, arson, mass runaways, brutality and a non-existent record of preventing recidivism, a reform movement took control of the program and abandoned the congregate system of the juvenile jails. During that time period, over 6,000 men/boys passed through the doors of the institution. During the transition from the congregate system to the cottage system, the best boys 15 and younger remained at the Peters Farm Reform School while the more aggressive and dangerous boys were sent to the newly opened Concord Reformatory and elsewhere. Legislators also voted to abandon the existing buildings and convey the property to the newly established Westborough Insane Asylum and located the new juvenile facility to Powder Hill overlooking the Worcester Turnpike.
The majority of boys adjudicated delinquent and committed to Lyman were mentally challenged, emotionally disturbed, school truants or stubborn and neglected children (status offences). These boys had been rejected by parents or state agencies and were mixed in with convicted delinquents who committed serious crimes. Boys were committed for a term of two months to five years. As the population of Lyman steadily grew, overcrowding was an ongoing issue that was addressed through legislative indifference.
The new facility opened in 1885 with 100 of the best boys ages ten to 15 transferred from the old Reform School while boys’ seven to ten were deflected to a new facility in Berlin. The new cottage plan provided for custodial and industrial training for delinquent boys. It was intended to resemble a family-style home as opposed to the centralized system of the adult prisons. Each cottage was overseen by a married couple, the master and matron who lived in separate quarters in the cottage, a teacher and a laundress. Each cottage was designed for 30 boys who were assigned by age and ability. The boys slept in open dormitories, ate their meals in the cottage dining room, played in the recreation room but prison lock stepped to their daily work assignments or extra curricular activities.
However, the new building design resembled those of the old Reform School and the daily routine of the boys, their diets, work hours, school hours and recreation time remained virtually the same as the Reform School. What did change were the boys’ living conditions with no walls or fences and no barred windows or doors. Lyman was an open campus. Although the newly-constructed three-story monolithic brick buildings resembled those of other state institutions, they were referred to as cottages, a misnomer. Without having prior knowledge of the Reform School, the forerunner of the Lyman School, a casual visitor passing through the open campus would observe the finely landscaped lawns and decorative flower arrangements, the impressive brick architecture and clean white farm buildings. There were smooth roads and concrete sidewalks connecting all of the buildings. The campus had all the appearances of an open campus prep school.
During the next 70 years, the state purchased adjacent properties and approximately 700 acres of farm land on Powder Hill north of the Turnpike to the Assabet River, along Milk Street and north and east to Lake Chauncy and the former reform school which became the Westboro Insane Asylum. Throughout its history, there was never a master building plan for Lyman. Although the legislature grudgingly approved funding for more cottages, acquired more farm land and increased the farm program to feed an expanding population, there was very little support for educational and vocational programs, which is what these boys desperately needed
The Great Depression had little impact on the legislature, which continued to fund additional building projects to support Lyman’s growing population. During the war years, boys enlisted in the armed forces. The academics program was discontinued for those boys who volunteered to keep the coal furnaces burning and work long hours at the farm and the dairy to keep food on the table. Needless to say, these boys never received any educational or vocational training.
When the United States was thrust into World War II, all the eligible Lyman boys and male staff were either drafted or enlisted. The staffing of Lyman was left up to the women employees and men too old to serve in the armed forces. Consequently classroom attendance was suspended during the war and every physically able boy worked the farm, tended to the boiler system shoveling coal 24/7, worked in the kitchen or shoveled snow during the winter months and landscaped in the summer.
After World War II, Lyman’s population became ethnically diversified. However unlike prior commitments, these boys were violent in nature, psychopathic, illiterate and generally un-incorrigible. As more social services became available at the gateway of the juvenile justice system, more of the younger less troubled boys were diverted away from Lyman. The 50s and 60s brought in street-hardened boys that were not only convicted delinquents but were involved in gangs, substance abuse and weapons.
In 1947, Legislative investigation of Lyman characterized the male faculty as misfits, malcontents and alcoholics who were appointed as political hacks. In the 1950s, Lyman experienced reform movements that would eventually lead to the closing of the facility. In 1950, 200 acres of farm land was sold to help finance the implementation of the 40-hour work week recently made law thus ending the full time cottage parents and the farm help that worked 60 to 70 hours a week. The money was necessary to hire more employees to staff the cottages 24/7. The trade unions further pressured the legislature to cease the use of boys in building maintenance and farm work. They made the point that the boys were nothing more than free child labor. In 1952, the Lyman Trustees were disbanded and the Division of Youth Services was created to manage the state’s juvenile delinquency program.
As a direct result of the boys’ ban from performing any form of routine maintenance, the older buildings fell into a state of neglect the farm lands went fallow, the hay fields uncut and the animals were eventually sold off. The boys were relegated to domestic chores that were eagerly volunteered for rather than spend their idle hours watching television. The boys were allowed to work as domestics in the cottages making beds and cleaning floors, as kitchen help and laundry workers. The boys in trust were allowed to work at landscaping and snow removal.
In 1953, the Legislature discontinued the farming program and released three industrial arts instructors which in affect ended the only semblance of vocational training. However, they did continue with institutional maintenance funding on an emergency basis only, but they approved two new buildings, a central cafeteria and a school building. This brick one-story school building, typical of the era, was built to accommodate the growing Lyman population. However, little thought or planning was done to make this an adequate learning facility. The classrooms would only accommodate 20 students and with a population in excess of 585, the new building was totally inadequate. Once again the legislature failed in their attempt to educate these boys.
By 1960, fewer than twenty five cottage staff per day were interacting in some way with the 590 boys at the school, leaving 155 employees on the Lyman payroll that had no daily contact at all with a boy. Still, every boy was required to attend school classes. However, there was no farm work, carpentry shop or vocational training. No extra curricular activities, for the most part the boys were confined to their cottages
Then, in the mid 1960s, there was a national reform movement against incarcerating juveniles in institutions. In 1968, Massachusetts Governor John Volpe requested the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare to investigate Lyman and other state facilities. Their findings identified the Division of Youth Services as a scandalous neglect and mistreatment of children state wide. Lyman had become a dumping ground for political appointments and hacks and for hundreds of boys that were cast off as being lost souls of society. In 1969, newly elected Governor Frank Sergeant terminated the commissioner of the Division of Youth Services and immediately hired another to deinstitutionalize the system. Dr. Jerome Miller, an assistant Professor of Psychology from Ohio State University was hired. Although Miller had little experience dealing with juveniles or for that matter a broken reform system, he did have extensive experience in conventional and non traditional treatment and counseling of adults. But as he would quickly learn, he was clearly out of his area of expertise.
In 1971, the remaining status offenders were removed from Lyman and returned to their relatives or placed in foster care while convicted juvenile delinquents from other closed facilities were moved into Lyman. Two girls cottages were opened at Lyman and, for a short time, the school was coed and the facility continued to spiral out of control. There were frequent runaways and numerous disturbances that required the intervention of the local police to support the staff with maintaining order. Then in January 1972, in a desperate attempt to take control, Miller executed a clandestine operation whereby student supporters from the University of Massachusetts appeared at Lyman and shuttled the remaining boys off the property to Amherst to become part of the new social reform movement. Lyman School for Boys was shuttered after 86 years of service. The employees that resided on the campus became jobless but remained caretakers of an empty facility.
Today, Lyman’s sprawling farmlands have been sold off or conveyed to other state and local agencies. The remaining campus buildings that were not rehabilitated for use by other agencies were abandoned and left boarded up to endure the ravages of time and neglect until they collapse into their own foundations. When Lyman was closed, the school had 265 acres of land. [1]",1971,"Westborough, MA",,
Massachusetts,Massachusetts Industrial School for Boys,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Massachusetts_Industrial_School_for_Boys,,,1909,Closed,,,Shirley Industrial School for Boys,"The Shirley Industrial School for Boys was a part of this town from 1909 - 1972 and was the topic of the Shirley Historical Society meeting on Friday, May 11, 2001.  Ray Farrar who worked at the school and Joe Landry whose father worked there attended the meeting and were video taped sharing their stories.  Other former workers and State School ""boys"" have contacted the Museum and we have added their memories to our files.
In 1908, the Shirley Shaker Community had only three Shaker sisters, 900 acres of land and twenty-six buildings.  The Shaker Central Ministry decided to close the community, sell the property, and have the sisters move to the Harvard Shaker Village.  The state of Massachusetts bought the Shaker property for an Industrial School for Boys, what we now call a reform school.  This industrial school was to take boys ages 15 - 20 and give them a house mother and a house father, give them academic schooling, and teach them manners and a trade.  The farmland and large old Shaker buildings were well suited to these purposes and were promptly fitted out with modern conveniences.
The Shirley Historical Society has census records for 1920, 1930, and 1940 listing the names of people who lived on the state property. It gives their ages and marital status, place of birth, and parents' places of birth, but not much else.

Massachusetts,Massachusetts Industrial School for Girls,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Massachusetts_Industrial_School_for_Girls,,,1854,Active,Single Building,,Lancaster Industrial School for Girls | Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Lancaster (Current),"One of America’s oldest girls training schools, the Lancaster Industrial School for Girls was established in 1854 as one of the most progressive correctional institutions for women of its day. Institutions like the Lancaster Industrial School led the way in social reform, copying a cottage system created in France that emphasized a wholesome, family-like atmosphere and the opportunity to rise above the “low life” slums from which Victorians assumed delinquent children came from. Providing individual rooms for each girl rather than in crowded dormitories, the architecture of the Lancaster Industrial School was as progressive as its goals.
The girls were housed in eight, three-floor cottages. A parlor, sewing and dining room, kitchen, laundry, and schoolroom were on the first floor. The housemother, a teacher, and the girls lived on the second floor, with each room providing the relative luxuriousness of a single bed, chair, bureau, and corner closet. Special teachers lived in apartments on the third floor. As schools like the Lancaster Industrial School proved that reform efforts worked far better than prison time, other states began to establish schools for troubled adolescents. By the late 19th century, “Industrial Schools” with an emphasis on reform had become commonplace, a method that many states continue to implement today.",1975 (as a juvenile facility),"Lancaster, MA",,
Massachusetts,Adams-Nervine Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Adams-Nervine_Asylum,,1895,,Closed,,,,"The Adams-Nervine Asylum was incorporated in 1877 and opened in 1880 in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The estate provided an attractive, picturesque setting, as it was situated on Centre Street, in the neighborhood of Bussy Park and the Arnold Arboretum. Having previously been owned by J. Gardiner Weld, it was purchased by Seth Adams with his fortune acquired from his sugar refinery in South Boston. With his brother Isaac, Seth had formerly manufactured printing presses and machinery. On his death, his estate bequeathed $600,000 for the establishment of a curative institution for the benefit of indigent, debilitated and nervous people: inhabitants of the State who were not insane. The trustees purchased neighboring properties for the Asylum in 1879.
The institution was to incorporate the theories of Thomas Kirkbride. Kirkbride was a contemporary Philadelphian psychiatrist who developed the system of moral treatment for patients with nervous disorders. In his practice, he advocated a home-style atmosphere, non-isolation, and the dignity of the patients. The asylum was to stress the importance of patient individuality and freedom of movement.
The first patient of the asylum was admitted on April 11, 1880. The statistics of the asylum show that of those admitted, unmarried women are in a great majority. According to the doctor, the nervousness in these women was directly related to them out working themselves and waiting upon others. Housework and teaching contributed to nearly 50 percent of the victims of nervous disorders. Nearly 20 percent of the patients came under the head of “housewives”. Among housewives, overwork, care, anxiety, and sleeplessness, incident to domestic afflictions, were the assigned causes.
The number of recoveries at the asylum was not large. One of the asylum’s doctors, Dr. Webber, stated in an annual report, “Many patients have been ailing for years, or have inherited a weak, nervous organization, and those among such patients whose means have been limited have been obliged to uses their strength and energy in keeping the home circle unbroken. The strain of this upon a naturally weak, nervous system is severe, and in such cases, a partial recovery is the most that can be expected from a ‘few months’ stay at the asylum. The relief obtained is, however, of great benefit, enabling the patient to take up her burdens again with fresh courage and renewed strength. They do not realize the amount of strength they have gained until after returning to their accustomed labors, and many continue to improve, and subsequently regain full health.”
The average stay of patients at the Asylum was a little over four months, and few stayed longer than six. Occasionally a patient remained for a year, but this was not considered desirable.
The complex is made up of three large buildings and four smaller ones. The oldest structure, the J. Gardiner Weld House, was built c. 1875, in the French Mansard style. The unknown architect delivered a facile version of the French Mansard style villa and the interior ornament was also elaborate, academic, and architectonically placed to articulate openings, corners, and other shifts of plane. Interior revisions were made in 1879 when the house became the administrative offices.
The Adams House, built in 1880, served the female patients; it was not until 1895 that a House for Men was completed. Men never numbered more than 25% of the total patient population of about forty.
The Director’s House displayed the neo-classical symmetry and proportions of the Colonial Revival style and contrasts with the picturesque forms of the Weld Mansion and Adams House.
The asylum was added to the List of Registered Historic Places in Suffolk County, Massachusetts in 1982.[1]",,,,

Compared to most of the other asylums in the region, Channing’s sanitarium was unique in the treatment it prescribed. Due to the relatively small number of patients — 25 or so appeared to be the maximum at any time — its doctors and nurses were able to provide individualized treatments that focused more on routing out the cause of the illness rather than merely suppressing its symptoms. How this was accomplished required not only occupational therapy and other physical therapies (such as hydrotherapy, massage therapy, and electrotherapy), but also a somewhat primitive form of modern psychotherapy. Another relatively pioneering approach that Channing subscribed to was the belief that there was a benefit to employing female nurses over male orderlies.
Little seemed to change at the sanitarium when Channing moved it from Brookline to Wellesley in 1916. Although the reasons for moving are unclear, I’m guessing that it had to do with the rapid development of Brookline that had begun during the 1890s and accelerated post-1900. Fisher Hill was just no longer conducive for a sanitarium. Much of Wellesley, however — including the area around Great Plain and Wellesley Avenues (now part of the Babson College campus) — was still largely undeveloped. Channing Sanitarium (in Wellesley) originally consisted of seven buildings — all designed by the nationally renowned architectural firm of Kilham & Hopkins.
Patients weren’t confined to cell-like rooms, but rather encouraged to walk among the surrounding woods. Each also had his or her own private suite with its own living room, bathroom, and open-air sleeping porch. (Eight of the twenty-four suites also had an indoor bedroom.) In addition to the four dormitories, there were three other buildings on the sanitarium grounds: one housing administrative offices, a service building (presumably where many of the employees resided and the only of the seven original buildings no longer standing), and a third used for both recreation and treatment.
Channing Sanitarium would close in 1951 after its acquisition by Roger W. Babson, founder of the Babson Institute. Although Babson intended at first to keep the sanitarium operational, as he was always fascinated by “the relationship between the physical condition of the average man’s brain and the efficiency of his work”, the plans quickly changed to establishing a graduate school there. But even that idea never came to fruition as the increasing enrollment of the Babson Institute necessitated the use of the facility’s buildings for faculty and student housing. The former sanitarium is now known as Woodland Hill.",,"Wellesley, MA",,

Massachusetts,McLean Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=McLean_Hospital,,1811,,Active,Cottage Plan,Charles Bulfinch,Asylum For The Insane | McLean Asylum,"McLean Hospital was founded on Feb. 25, 1811, through a charter granted by the Massachusetts Legislature for the ""Massachusetts General Hospital Corporation."" From its inception, the Corporation intended to treat both physical and mental illnesses, with a separate facility for each. Fundraising campaigns were held between 1812 and 1816, and a majority of the contributors earmarked their donations for the establishment of a facility to treat mental illnesses. Consequently, more than 18 acres of the former Joseph Barrell country estate located about two miles outside of Boston in Charlestown, Mass. later Somerville, Mass. was purchased in December 1816. The Barrell mansion, which would become home to the Superintendent of the hospital and his family as well as the central administration building, had been designed by the renowned architect Charles Bulfinch in 1792. Bulfinch and his understudy Mathew Parris were instrumental in the adaptation of the mansion to its new purpose and the design of additional wings as patient living quarters.
McLean Hospital was first known as the ""Asylum for the Insane,"" a division of the Massachusetts General Hospital. The Asylum opened on Oct. 1, 1818, and admitted its first patient on Oct. 6, 1818. Following treatment reforms originating in France with Dr. Philippe Pinel and in England with Quaker William Tuke, the Asylum followed the principles of ""moral treatment,"" both in its choice of the country setting and in the care of its patients. The Asylum's first superintendent, Rufus Wyman, MD, was the first physician appointed to such a post in America.
When the Asylum opened in 1818, it was the first hospital in New England, and only the fourth special institution for the treatment of the mentally ill in America. In June of 1826 the Asylum was renamed ""The McLean Asylum for the Insane,"" in honor of John McLean, a Boston merchant who bequeathed $25,000 and left a residuary legacy of more than $90,000 to the Asylum. In 1844, 13 Asylum superintendents from the Eastern Seaboard, including McLean's Luther V. Bell, MD, (1837-1856 and 1857-1858), founded the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane, now known as the American Psychiatric Association.
In the 1840s, 1850s and early 1860s, the McLean Asylum in Somerville slowly lost its tranquil environment, deemed so important in the treatment of mentally ill patients. The Asylum had grown in size, including its number of patients, buildings and acreage. The railroads encroached on the land adjacent to the Asylum and by 1872, two tracks cut through the grounds. From 1872 through 1874, the Trustee Committee on New Sites for the Asylum separately commissioned the now famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and a local civil engineer Joseph Curtis to conduct site surveys and to report on a suitable site for the building of a new Asylum. In 1875, the Trustees, based upon the Committee on New Sites recommendation of July 18, 1873, purchased 107 acres on Wellington Hill in Belmont from the Waverley Land Company. While Olmsted's involvement after 1875 cannot be documented, Joseph Curtis' involvement in the development of the landscape and building arrangement continued through project completion and into the next century.
Superintendent Edward Cowles, MD, (1879-1904) was intimately involved in the planning and construction of the new Belmont site. The Trustees and Dr. Cowles agreed that the campus should be developed and constructed according to a ""cottage plan,"" which called for the erection of a number of cottages where individual patients received care, surrounding a large administration building. According to Dr. Cowles, the cottage plan was intended to create a residential, rather than an institutional, effect for patients.
In 1892, at Dr. Cowles' request, the McLean Asylum was renamed the McLean Hospital ""in recognition of the present broader views upon the subject of insanity and its treatment."" In that same year, construction began at the Belmont site. In April 1895, the first patients were transferred from the Asylum in Somerville to Belmont. Exactly 77 years from the date of the opening of the original Asylum, the new McLean Hospital opened on Oct. 1, 1895.[1]

Massachusetts,Essex County Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Essex_County_Sanatorium,,,1928,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Essex County Tuberculosis Sanatorium,"The first published report on tuberculosis in the United States was compiled in 1889 by the New York City Department of Health. Commonly known as consumption or “the white plague”, the bacterial lung infection known as tuberculosis grew into a global epidemic after the close of World War I. Massachusetts, along with many other states, expedited construction of county sanatoriums specifically for the care of patients with active TB. Salem officials agreed that the town of Middleton was the best location since it was located on a hill, with plenty of open air and just 2 miles north of Danvers State Hospital. Three years later, John H. Bickford  designed the the Essex County Tuberculosis Sanatorium. The facility opened on May 26, 1921 and occupied over 88 acres, just 2 miles north of Danvers State Hospital.
“The San”, as it was often referred to, was filled to its capacity—350 patients- in its first year of operation. During this time, the closest sanatoriums were in Rutland, MA and Hebron, Maine. Ten years later, the Middlesex County Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Waltham, MA opened in 1931 to relieve overcrowding in the other facilities. The treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in the 1920's was rudimentary. Sulfa drugs and penicillin, as well as certain forms of surgery, have eliminated the need for long periods of hospitalization, allowing for better management of the disease.Patients at the San were doctors, lawyers, clergymen, bank executives, insurance agents, and even undertakers. There were fishermen from Gloucester, tannery workers from Peabody, stone cutters from Rockport, shoe workers from Lynn, and  many others. The ages varied from as young as 7 to as old as 80.Dr. Olin S. Pettingill was The San's first Superintendent. Dr. Pettingill (1882-1969) worked at the following facilities and dedicated his life to the study and elimination of tuberculosis:
Assistant Physician Rutland State Sanatorium, resigned in October 1914
Assistant Superintendent at the Rhode Island State Sanatorium at Wallum Lake  1914- Dec. 1915
Superintendent State Sanatorium Hebron Maine 1916-April 1921
Superintendent Essex County 1921-1937
When he transferred to Middleton, he brought with him an already assembled staff of nurses and doctors from the Hebron facility where he served as superintendent for five years. The majority of the staff members lived on the hospital grounds in the Webb House which was located where the Essex County Correctional Facility now stands.
The treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis was quite simple: good food and plenty of rest being the initial cure. It was typical to see patients covered in layers of clothes and blankets, the windows wide open even during the winter months-- fresh air and relaxation were the keys to recovery. Like many other institutions, The San kept the male and female patients separated. The male patients were at one wing and females at the opposite wing. The Essex Sanatorium was also completely self-sufficient. It had its own power, heating, and water supply along with livestock, and fruit and vegetable farms located west of the property. In 1960, as the number of active tuberculosis cases lessened, the Sanatoriums expanded to treat other chronic disease patients. Eventually the chronic disease patients were moved elsewhere, and the last tuberculosis patients were moved to the Middlesex County Hospital in July of 1964.
​The buildings sat abandoned for over a decade. During those years, the San had its share of homeless living in the buildings, vandalism and numerous fires.
​In the summer of 1968, a doctor’s home was set on fire
A fire destroyed the superintendent's building on November 4th, 1969. The superintendent's building was immediately demolished as a result of the fire damage.
December 23, 1969 the interior of the former administration building was set on fire
The male dormitories were set on fire on Saturday, March 31, 1973
April 1, 1972 firemen worked five hours to put out a fire at the San’s Web House, a dormitory for married couples.
Late April 1972 a barn behind the Web House was destroyed by fire.
June 6, 1972 a small summer house of the former superintendent of the prison farm, adjacent to the San complex was gutted in a 2-hour blaze involving 21 firefighters
Middleton officials expressed repeated concern in those final years over the strong possibility of a fatal accident on the San grounds as the town answered fire call after fire call. Finally, the County Commissioners put up the funding to have the structures razed. In January 1974, the entire campus was demolished. 
The state put the property up for sale and struggled for many years to find a buyer. Out of the 88 acres that were up for sale, MIT purchased a portion of the land and the Essex Agricultural & Technical School purchased another portion. After many years of back-and-forth debates with the people of Middleton and County Commissioners, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts purchased the remaining acres and the Essex County Correctional Facility (Middleton Jail) opened in 1991. The opening of the Middleton House of Corrections resulted in the closing of the Salem and Lawrence jails. ""[1]

It is adjacent to the campus of the former MCH hospital (which is now being developed into housing). The hospital was constructed by the county as a tuberculosis sanatorium. Land was acquired in 1929 through purchase and use of eminent domain.",,,,
Massachusetts,Norfolk County Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Norfolk_County_Hospital,,,1917,Preserved,Single Building,,Massachusetts Respiratory Hospital,"Norfolk County Hospital got its start in 1917 when the county commissioners took by eminent domain 98 acres of land at the intersection of Washington (Route 37) and South streets for a county-run tuberculosis hospital. When TB faded as a health problem in the 1960s and 1970s, the hospital took on a new mission and, eventually, a new identity. In 1987, it was renamed as the Massachusetts Respiratory Hospital, and the 110-bed facility it specialized in treatments of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, emphysema and lung cancer.
In 1997, facing a running deficit, the trustees of the hospital voted to sell the facility and the 19 acres it sits on, to Kindred Healthcare, a national company. Kindred stunned town officials by quickly closing the hospital in 2008. At the time, the hospital had only 40 patients. The town purchased five acres of land from Kindred in 2007, which is now the site of a playground. In 2010, the town exercised its first-refusal option and purchased another 22 acres of the hospital property − at the time, it was the largest undeveloped parcel in town. The property included the former nurses quarters that had been used as a minimum security jail. Since the purchase, the land has been used by the Norfolk County Sheriff’s office for office space and youth programs. The Braintree Community Arts Center is also on former hospital property.
The main hospital building is now the home of CATS Academy Boston, a private high school catering to international students. The property underwent a $50 to 60 million renovation project, including the construction of dormitories with space for 400 students.",1997,"Braintree, MA",,

Then the name of the facility changed to Plymouth County Hospital.  Later in 1982 the institution again changed its name to Cranberry Specialty Hospital when its main focus became providing long-term care to patients stricken with chronic illnesses.
In 1991, the 60 patients at Cranberry Specialty Hospital were transferred to Middleborough and the old hospital building was abandoned. In 1999, the 56-acre property was sold to the town of Hanson. In 2001, Baran Partners purchased 23 acres and made plans to build townhouses and an assisted living facility, but these plans fell through and the hospital sat abandoned being the victim of three fires in a four year span.",1992,"South Hanson, MA",Mediterranean Revival,
