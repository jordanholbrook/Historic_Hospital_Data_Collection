Originally built for ""the care, custody, and treatment of insane criminals of the state,"" the Waterbury State Hospital eventually became the temporary or permanent shelter for Vermonters with mild to severe mental disabilities and others who had been committed for epilepsy, depression, alcoholism, or senility. Throughout its history, methods of patient diagnosis and treatment varied according to the philosophy of the superintendent.
Image of Eugene A. Stanley Early twentieth century efforts among reformers to reduce the stigma of mental illness and confinement in state hospitals yielded to the pessimism of the eugenics era, which brought back the stigma with a vengeance. It was during these years that Dr. Eugene A. Stanley directed affairs at Waterbury. An advocate of eugenics, Dr. Stanley testified in favor of the sterilization bills in 1927 and 1931, provided the Eugenics Survey access to patient records, and played an influential role as an advisor to the Eugenics Survey. He was a member of the sub-committee on ""Care of the the Handicapped"" for the Vermont Commission on Country Life.
Dr. Eugene A. Stanley (1875-1936) was born and raised in New Hampshire and educated at Cleveland University of Medicine and Surgery and Jefferson Medical College. He moved to Waterbury, Vermont in 1899, where he served as a health officer and assistant physician at the Vermont State Hospital from 1908 to 1918. He became Vermont State Hospital superintendent in 1918, succeeding Dr. Walter L. Wasson, who had perished in the influenza epidemic . Stanley held that position until his death in 1936.
During Dr. Stanley's tenure at the Waterbury State Hospital, the patient population grew, peaking at 1,728 during the mid-1930s. In 1931, Stanley convinced the state legislature to construct a new three-story building for the growing number of ""acutely disturbed female patients."" By today's standards, treatment of patients was primitive, at times barbaric. Typically women in this ward and severe epileptic patients were tied to wooden benches with ""camisoles,"" which secured their arms in back of them. Hydrotherapy, where patients were immersed in continuous baths or placed in wet sheet packs, and ""colonic irrigation"" were standard treatments for disruptive patients; eventually electro-shock therapy and drug therapy replaced these treatments.
More able patients assumed various roles in the work of the institution, including custodial work, maintenance, and tending animals and crops on the institution-run farm in Duxbury. Dr. Stanley also initiated a system of industrial work for patients: assembling clothespins, shoe repair, and crafts such as making chairs, rugs, and baskets. The profits from these enterprises were used for patient entertainment and recreation.
In August 2011, hurricane Irene's flood waters flooded the valley which the closed complex stood.  At one point the entire complex was underwater and partially destroyed by the hurricane.  After the flood waters receded the campus was deemed unusable.  The main complex was saved and has been renovated into the State Offices. The complex reopened in December 2015.

Vermont,Brandon Training School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brandon_Training_School,1912,,1915,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Vermont State School for Feeble Minded Children | Brandon School for the Feeble-Minded | Brandon State School,"In 1912 the Vermont State Legislature authorized the construction of a school for the care and training of feeble-minded children aged 5-21 years. When the State School for the Feeble-minded in Brandon, Vermont opened in 1915, it soon assumed the eugenic function of segregation from society of ""feeble-minded women of childbearing age.""
The institution filled rapidly and soon became over-crowded with women and children, many placed there for reasons of poverty, neglect, illiteracy, or failure in school. Social, legal, and economic forces conspired to create the problem. In 1918, destitute children could no longer be placed in poorhouses or on poor farms, and child welfare agents often placed children at Brandon. In 1919, the age for women committed to Brandon was raised to 45 years. In 1921 town listers were required by law to submit names and ages of feeble-minded children in their towns.
Dr. Truman J. Allen served as Vermont State School superintendent from 1918 until his death in 1937. Born in Royalton, Vermont in 1888, Dr. Allen graduated from the UVM College of Medicine in 1913. He served as assistant physician at the Vermont State Hospital for the Insane and Instructor of Mental Diseases at the UVM College of Medicine prior to his appointment at Brandon. Persistently frustrated with over-crowded facilities and low budgets, Dr. Allen sought to expand the institution and enlarge its authority over Vermont's ""feeble-minded"" population. In 1925, a colony for feeble-minded women was started in Rutland, where women received training as domestics and were hired out to local families to help make the institution self-supporting.
The Vermont State School assumed an important role in Vermont's eugenics movement. Records of inmates provided starting points for the Eugenics Survey's ""pedigrees of degenerate families"" in 1925-28 and for their 1929 study of the ""Brandon Waiting List."" Inmates were tested in the National Committee of Mental Hygiene 1927 mental survey of Vermont school children. While Truman Allen's support for eugenics was qualified, he actively promoted the passage of the 1931 sterilization law as ""one tool"" in a comprehensive program to control the mentally deficient population.
Dr. Allen's successor, Dr. Frederick Thorne, supported eugenic measures in the 1940s, expanded the women's colony at Rutland, and enlarged his authority over state programs for mental retardation. He supervised the state psychiatric clinics begun in 1939 and served on the State Board for Control of Mental Defectives. From 1915 until it closed in 1993, Brandon Training School was home to 2,324 Vermonters.
After the closing the State attempted to sell the buildings in one piece.  This effort was unsuccessful and the buildings were eventually sold piecemeal.  Today the facilities are known as Park Village and all of the buildings except one are occupied by doctors’ offices, daycare facilities, subsidized housing, a music and arts center and other small businesses.

Vermont,Brattleboro Retreat,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brattleboro_Retreat,,,1834,Active,Pre-1854 Plans,,Vermont Asylum for the Insane | Vermont Asylum,"Retreat Healthcare was founded as the Brattleboro Retreat in 1834, by a $10,000 donation by Anna Marsh as attested to in her will. The hospital was the first facility for the mentally ill in Vermont, and one of the first ten psychiatric hospitals in the United States. The new facility was patterned on a Quaker concept called moral treatment, a daring departure in the care for the mentally ill. Patients were treated with dignity and respect in a caring, family-like environment that included meaningful work, cultural pursuits, wholesome nutrition and daily exercise. In support of this philosophy, the Retreat pioneered an impressive list of hospital firsts: the first continuous patient newspaper; the first attendant's training course; the first gymnasium, camping programs, swimming pools and bowling alley, and the first self sufficient dairy farm; all reflecting the emphasis on physical well being.

Vermont,Vermont Industrial School,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Vermont_Industrial_School,,,1874,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Vermont Reform School | Weeks School,"The Vermont Industrial School was authorized by the state legislature in 1865 as the Vermont Reform School and soon put into operation in the town
of Waterbury. The School was to aid in the reformation and correction of all offenders under eighteen years of age, changed to sixteen years in 1866. Prior to the establishment of this School, juveniles were treated the same as adults. The school was all but destroyed by fire in 1874, so the legislature appropriated $49,000 for it to move to the old Champlain Arsenal grounds in Vergennes, where it remained until it closed in April 1979. In 1875, permission was given to send girls from ages ten to fifteen to the school. The Vermont Reform School had its name changed in 1900 to the Vermont Industrial School, then in 1937 to the Weeks School in honor of former Governor John E. Weeks. The School was controlled by a three member commission until 1906 when it came under the Board of Penal Institutions. In the years between 1906 and 1966, the School underwent some changes in control. In 1966 Weeks School was administered by the Department of Institutions. When it closed in 1979, the School was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections.
The institution played a role in the eugenics movement in Vermont. In 1925 Henry F. Perkins, professor of zoology at the University of Vermont, organized the
Eugenic Survey of Vermont as an adjunct to his heredity course. Its mission was to conduct eugenics research, educate the public about the results of
that research, and provide support for social legislation that would reduce the apparent growing population of Vermont’s “social problem group.” Professor Perkins reportedly brought his heredity class to Vermont Industrial School for “field work” in eugenics, and many of the Eugenics Survey’s genealogies of so called “degenerate” families originated with children at this institution.
Besides juvenile delinquents the school also served as a temporary shelter for children who were not delinquent, but were dependent or neglected children. In the
1960’s the school offered a strong developmental and educational program in a campus atmosphere. At that time the population was about 160 with seventy to ninety additional children in foster homes under the eye of the institution.
In the 1979 with the movement for deinstitutionalization and for centralization of human services functions, the federal government offered to take the Weeks School as a Job Corps site. Federal funds supported a transition to a community-based system of juvenile services, and the Departments of Corrections and Social and Rehabilitation Services used those funds to begin a network of group homes, open a secure detention unit at Waterbury State Hospital, and create a wilderness camp. The state transferred responsibility for children adjudicated delinquent to the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, which in turn contracted with community mental health centers, licensed group homes, schools, foster parents, and others for services formerly provided by state employees.
The federal government established a job corps program on the site.",1979,"Vergennes, VT",,
Vermont,Vermont State Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Vermont_State_Sanatorium,1907,,1921 (state),Preserved,Cottage Plan,,,"The Vermont Police Academy campus, recently named the Robert H. Wood Jr. Criminal Justice and Fire Service Training Center of Vermont, consists of one main building (main/center section and two attached cottages) and several outbuildings. The Main Building was built in 1907 on land purchased by the Proctors (owners of the Vermont Marble Company). Mr. Redfield Proctor was instrumental in purchasing the land and in building the facility, originally housing a hospital for treating tuberculosis patients; the cottages served as patients' living quarters.
The Vermont Sanatorium, as the hospital was called, was deeded to the State of Vermont in 1921. By 1967 advances in the field of medicine lead to a significant decline in the number of TB patients requiring treatment and the cost of operating the Sanatorium could no longer be justified.  The facility was then made available to any branch of state government for use. The State Police had been searching for suitable facilities for their training programs.  Also in 1967, the Vermont Legislature created the ""Law Enforcement Training Council,"" to oversee police training standards and it needed a home as well.  It was then decided the facility would be inspected for use as a training academy.",,"Pittsford, VT",,
Vermont,Washington County Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Washington_County_Hospital,,,1921,Preserved,Single Building,,Washington County Sanitarium | Washington County Mental Health,"The Washington County Sanatorium was opened in 1921 on Beckley Hill Road in Barre. ""The purpose of the [Washington County] sanitarium (sic) was the detection and treatment of tuberculosis, a pulmonary disease which during those years was a constant and common threat to stonecutters and their families"" (Elizabeth Ramon Bacon, Santander to Barre: Life in a Spanish Family in Vermont). It is true that a large number of Barre's stonecutters (as well as many family & community members) contracted tuberculosis, and people blamed both unsanitary and strenuous work conditions in the sheds, and unsanitary conditions of the worker's homes. Many tuberculosis patients where admitted to the sanatorium. Sadly most including Raymond Martin, didn't make it out alive. He died there on 30 Mar 1944 after a 246 day stay. He is buried in Williamstown Cemetery next to his wife, Hannah, who died on 13 Feb 1989. She never remarried, and the two never had any children.
In 1968, the Sanatorium was converted into the Carmette Monastery, which it remained for 29 years until being sold to Washington County Mental Health. ""This fall, the Barre community sold its 60-year-old brick building, a former sanitarium for quarry workers suffering from silicosis, to Washington County Mental Health"" (The Galveston Daily News, 6 Dec 1997). Today it is home to Washington County Mental Health's Children, Youth and Family Services. [1]",,"Barre, VT",,
