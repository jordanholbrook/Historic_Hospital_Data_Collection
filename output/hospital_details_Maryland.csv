Maryland,Clifton T. Perking State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Clifton_T._Perking_State_Hospital,1959,,,Active,Rambling Plan,,Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center,"The Clifton T. Perking State Hospital, was established by Chapter 814, Acts of 1959, as a Maximum Security Hospital with John M. Hamilton, M.D. as Superintendent. It adopted its present name in 1960. Designed to provide active treatment programs within a setting of maximum security, the hospital is located midway between Baltimore and Washington, D. C. The hospital receives patients who are referred by the courts of Maryland for pretrial psychiatric evaluation and provides a residential service for individual offenders who have been found to be ""not guilty by reason of insanity,"" as well as hospitalization for inmates of penal institutions who become mentally ill and require such hospitalization. In addition, the hospital accepts transfer patients whose illness requires maximum security treatment for a period of time. The hospital is designed for a maximum capacity of 300. It opened in January 1960; its population on June 30, 1964 was 185.
Staff: 1965, 245; Staff: 1966, 252.
The budget is predicated upon a population of 170 for the fiscal
year 1965 and 200 for the fiscal year 1966.
Appropriations 1965 1966
General Funds $1,280,829 $1,383,607
From the CTPHC Website: By an act of the General Assembly approved by the Governor on May 5, 1959, Maryland authorized the creation of a “Maximum Security Hospital” to be built in Jessup. It was named after Dr. Clifton T. Perkins, a distinguished psychiatrist who arrived in Maryland from Boston with a mission to reform the conditions in our public hospitals. He was a leader who brought about the desegregation of Maryland psychiatric hospitals in the face of considerable public antipathy and with the necessity of federal court action. Stuart B. Silver, for whom the Silver Wing of the hospital is named, is a past director of the Mental Hygiene Administration and was once the Superintendent of CTPHC. The Silver Wing is the maximum-security area of the hospital.
The maximum-security area of the hospital constructed in 1959 was built on two levels with six wings jutting into a recreation yard and surrounded by a large wall. Between 1972 and 1984, three additional wings were added: the Rehabilitation Wing, the Administration Building and an eighty-bed Medium Security Wing. In October of 1994, the Stuart B. Silver Wing of CTPHC was completed. This wing houses the admission ward (20 bed unit) five residential wards (30 bed units), a medical clinic, dining facility, chapel, library, conference center, family visiting rooms, and gymnasium. This wing replaces the original 1959 structure. In 2003 the newly renovated Rehabilitation Wing was reopened. The hospital is situated on a forty-five acre tract one mile south of Jessup on Dorsey Run Road.
Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center is licensed for 250 beds and is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)

Maryland,Crownsville State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Crownsville_State_Hospital,"April 11, 1910",,"March 13, 1911",Closed,Cottage Plan,Baldwin & Pennington/Henry Powell Hopkins,Hospital for the Negro Insane of Maryland,"The hospital for the negro insane of Maryland, now known as the Crownsville State Hospital, was created by an act of the General Assembly on April 11, 1910, which made an appropriation of $100,000 for the purchase of land and the erection of buildings. Sections of the act creating the hospital, Chapter 250, Laws of Maryland, 1910, provided that there should be established in the State of Maryland an institution for the detention and care of the negro insane of the state. It was expressly provided that the hospital should not be located in Baltimore City.
It was further provided that the Board of Managers of the hospital was to consist of the Governor, ex-officio; State Treasurer, Comptroller of the Treasury, and six other persons, to constitute a body corporate under the title of the "" Hospital for the Negro Insane of Maryland,"" with the power to appoint the necessary officers and agents. The act named the following persons, who, together with the Governor, State Comptroller and State Treasurer, were to constitute the first Board of Managers of the hospital: Hugh H. Young and Thomas Parran, to serve from the date of the passage of the act until the first of May, 1912; John T. Daily and William L. Marbury, to serve until the first day of May, 1914; J. Harry Covington and Henry P. Mann, to serve until the first day of May, 1916. It was provided that the Board of Managers should be divided into three classes, one-third of whom should go out of office every two years; and the Governor should have power, in case of any vacancy occurring, to appoint a person or persons to fill such vacancy or vacancies for the balance of term of said class. It was further enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland ""that the Board of Managers immediately proceed to the erection, construction and equipment of suitable buildings to care for such of the negro insane of the State of Maryland as may be sent to the said hospital from time to time, in accordance with the general provisions of the acts of the General Assembly of Maryland relative to the care and treatment of the insane of the state.""
On December 13, 1910, the board by formal resolution purchased the Boswell-Garrett-Hatch farm, located at Crownsville, Anne Arundel County, comprising 566 acres of land, with all improvements thereon, for the sum of $19,000. The title to the property having been examined by the Title Guarantee and Trust Company of Baltimore and found correct, the deed was transferred to the State of Maryland on May 22, 1911. The Board of Managers organizing on May 15, 1910, elected their respective officers and adopted by-laws. At the meeting of the Board of Managers of May 23, 1910, Dr. Robert P. Winterode was appointed superintendent.
With the two-fold purpose in view of relieving the county homes of their charges at the earliest possible date, also of economizing in every way by utilizing the patients' labor to grade, cut poles and cross ties for the railway spur, excavate for the buildings, harvest the willow crop and commence the necessary farming operations, the idea of housing patients in temporary quarters suggested itself. Active work was commenced immediately to convert the building formerly used as a willow plant into temporary quarters and prepare for the first transfer of patients. After a month's work, everything being in readiness, the first allotment of 12 patients from Spring Grove State Hospital was received on March 13, 1911. The temporary character of the camp necessitated the reception of only quiet and good workers. On March 18, 1911, four more were added, and on March 21, 1911, this number was increased to 21. From this group three patients were selected to assist the cook and wait in dining rooms of patients and officers. Two were assigned to work with the farm manager. The remainder commenced harvesting the willow crop. Patients worked with vim and their enthusiasm increased in proportion to the results shown, and after six weeks the entire "" holt "" was cut, bundled and stripped for market.
The increasing demand for workers, combined with the excellent results so far obtained with the small colony, was sufficient to justify an increase in the population. The next quota of 16 patients was selected from Montevue Asylum at Frederick, and was transferred on July 21, 1911. These patients were assigned to work in the woods, cutting cross ties for the spur, also poles for the conveying of electric current for lighting the building. As was to be expected, the work was crude and slow in the beginning, but with teaching, the type and quality of the work increased in efficiency until, when six weeks had elapsed, 750 cross ties were counted to their credit; also 20 poles, 35 feet long. To accomplish this work required the felling of 200 or more trees and with inexperienced woodmen it was almost phenomenal that no accidents resulted. By this time the work on the farm had increased to such an extent as to occupy all of the labor and in order to assist in the excavating and construction of new buildings it was deemed expedient to increase the number. Accordingly on October 13, 1911, 32 patients were brought from Montevue Asylum, Frederick. This group included quite a number of epileptics and imbeciles of low grade; 80 per cent of the entire number had never been occupied. On October 21, 1911, two patients were transferred from Sylvan Retreat; on September 15, 1911, one patient was transferred from the county home in Talbot County; on June 2 another was transferred from Charles County. All these transfers were made without a single mishap.
The destruction of the construction camp by fire on the night of March 7, 1912, came at a time when the results of the first year's labor had just become apparent. To thus, in a few minutes, find themselves thrown back to the point of starting was a painful and discouraging experience to the officers of the hospital. The only available protection providing roof and shelter for the patients to be found was a mile and a half distant in barns, where, with meager facilities, the patients were made reasonably comfortable for the night. The buildings which afforded shelter for 10 days thereafter were shacks formerly used by the contractor while excavating for the foundation. With the necessary repairs, they were ready for occupancy in 24 hours.
Construction of more permanent quarters was commenced immediately, and at the expiration of 14 days the first dormitory was occupied. Meals were brought over from the shacks for a few days until the kitchen was completed. In the absence of an immediate water supply, a temporary line of pipe was laid from the tank already constructed to supply water for building purposes. This building, which has been converted into a farm colony, was the home of the patients during the construction of the first permanent building. A one-story layout comprised dormitories for quiet and disturbed cases, and there were separate rooms for isolation purposes, also dining rooms to accommodate 10o or more patients. Included in this building was a room fitted up with shower baths for patients, also clothes room and quarters for laundry help. The attendants occupied a separate building connected by a short passage-way. This included a dining room and bath and sleeping accommodations. The office, dining room and bedroom of the superintendent completed the layout. As the demands for patients' labor on the new buildings were increasing daily and the present quarters had been taxed to their capacity, it was deemed advisable to add another dormitory to accommodate 50 additional patients.
On April 17, 1911, just one month and ten days after the fire, 19 men remaining at Spring Grove were transferred to the new hospital. On May 22, 18 Baltimore City patients were brought from Bay View. This number, on June 8, was increased by the transfer of 22 patients from Montevue. During the year new admissions were made from the counties, until the number under treatment at the close of the fiscal year 1912 reached 124. No more transfers were made until May 13, 1913, when 78 women and 18 men were brought from Montevue. The census of the population on September 30, 1913, was 255. Of this number 165 are men and 90 are women.
The first unit of the group, known as the Reception Building, on which work was commenced in October, 1912, was occupied on May 1, 1913. It consists of a central building of four stories and two wings with three stories, extending almost at right angles from the central portion. On the first floor are located hydrotherapy wards for both men and women. These sections, being equipped for prolonged baths, will afford modern facilities for treating patients. A large area of this space in each wing is occupied by the laundry, which is divided into two rooms, one being equipped for washing and the other for ironing. The washers, extractors and conveyor are operated by electricity with separate drum control, so that any one of them may be operated separately. The extractors are fitted with safety covers as a safeguard against accidents. The ironing is done by electric irons. Conduits for increased accommodations were also provided before laying the floor, so that additional facilities may be readily added. The remaining space of this floor is taken up with store rooms. dining rooms for both patients and attendants and heating plant. The second and third floors of the wings are devoted to day rooms and dormitories. The front of the first floor proper of the main building contains the administration offices, reception room for patients, clinical laboratory, pharmacy and offices for the staff. In the rear of this floor is a dining room for women, as well as a kitchen. The entire floor will be used for patients as soon as the central kitchen and administration buildings are completed, where accommodations for patients and officers have been provided. The second floor front of the main building is occupied by physicians. The two rooms in the rear are used temporarily for day room and sewing room. This entire space will later be converted into an infirmary. By these changes it will be possible to accommodate about 50 additional patients. The third floor of the central building is taken up with rooms for men and women nurses. The building is lighted by electricity and abundantly supplied with shower baths, toilets and washstands. The plumbing is modern in every detail.
The second building of the group, which is designated as the administration building, was completed in November, 1913. This building is of brick construction, three and one-half stories in height. On the first floor is a mortuary, post-mortem room, museum and storeroom. Offices of the staff and head nurse, laboratories, pharmacy, examination, reception and dining rooms for the officers occupy the first floor proper. Sleeping accommodations for the staff occupy the second floor. The third floor contains several rooms for employees. Between the reception building and the administration building, and connected with both by covered corridors, is the third unit, known as the Central Kitchen Building. On the ground floor will be the bakery, storage rooms for flour, preparation rooms for vegetables, cold storage and two large industrial rooms. The first floor is taken up with a central kitchen, sculleries, separate dining rooms for attendants, also for men and women patients ; the latter accommodating about 250 each. The second floor has two dormitories, each accommodating about 50 beds. The central portion of the building is utilized for a day room, also assembly hall for entertainments and religious services. The attic space is fitted up for sleeping quarters for help. The passage-ways connecting these buildings not only afford a means of easy access in unpleasant weather and at night, but, fully as important, serve as a cover for all pipes— heating and water supply—and conduits for electric wiring, which, in case of emergency, may be repaired without constantly digging and destroying property.
In the construction of buildings, operation of farm and preliminary construction work, patients' labor has been utilized in every possible way. Work therapy, aside from a remunerative consideration, has proven a most valuable asset from a curative standpoint. Those patients capable of being developed along different lines have been trained in the industrial shop, where willow-craft work, rug weaving, lathe turning and broom making are carried on extensively. The occupation of the women, though in different fields, has been given as much attention, with as encouraging results. All clothes worn by women, even the stockings, are made by them. There is also excellent work done by the ward classes, such as rug making, knitting, crocheting, cross-stitch work and quilting. The above does not include a large percentage of cases which are occupied in the laundry and general housework, and during the summer 30 or more work in the gardens. The system of occupation has developed pari passu with the growth of the hospital.[1]

By 1948 the hospital had approximately 1,800 patients. Patient population peaked in 1955 with 2,710 and was integrated by 1962. After serving the state psychiatric inpatient population for over ninety years, Crownsville Hospital Center closed on June 30, 2004. Two hundred patients were transferred to Spring Grove and Springfield Hospitals, and clinical staff was transferred with them. Currently, there is a skeleton crew at Crownsville to maintain the buildings and provide security. An environmental firm is investigating the land to determine if chemicals are buried there. Anne Arundel County is being offered the land for free as it has the first right of refusal before the state offers it to others.
The MHA budget for Crownsville for fiscal year 2006 is now $1.6 million, down from $27 million in fiscal year 2005. Four million of these savings will be available annually for a five county collaboration (Anne Arundel, Prince George’s, Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary’s) to provide community services. These services will include in-home support services for children and adolescents to maintain them in their communities and the development of Assertive Community Treatment models for adults with persistent and serious mental illness. The rest of the savings will be used to reduce the state budget deficit for the Mental Hygiene Administration.
For many employees, the transition period was a sad time as many had worked there for years. Sheilah Davenport, Crownsville’s Acting CEO since March of 2003, acknowledged that Crownsville staff were like family, with some employees having had parents who worked there before them. Paul Lurz, Director of Performance Improvement, retired after working there for 40 years. He regrets that Crownsville has closed, noting that its history was marked by a commitment to patients’ rights beginning with its inception in l912 to serve the African American population needing psychiatric care. In the l950s, Crownsville’s Superintendent, Dr. Morgenstern, refused to allow lobotomies, and he was the first director to hire African American staff. In the l960s, Charles Ward, the superintendent at that time, released African Americans who were hospitalized simply because they were demonstrating for civil rights, sending a letter to the papers denouncing their hospitalizations. Paul Lurz also describes Crownsville as being the hospital known for its reluctance to put patients on the streets without post hospital arrangements.
According to CEO Sheilah Davenport, the first inquiry into closing a state hospital occurred in December 2002 when a State Legislative Analyst recommended closure to help resolve the State’s budget deficit. Legislators asked the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to choose one to close and withheld $2 million from the their budget until a final report was presented to the Legislature. The recommendation was to close a facility which would have the least impact on patients, their families, and staff while ensuring that all state beds would be maintained within the system. The recommendation was to close Crownsville-- it was the smallest hospital, and its patients could be more easily transferred to the two larger facilities, keeping the number of beds intact.
In October 2003, Nelson Sabatini, Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, went to Crownsville to inform staff that their hospital was being considered for closure and to reassure them the Department would ensure a smooth transition and attempt, to the best of its ability, to find placements for staff. For the next several months, staff awaited a final decision by the legislature. CEO Sheilah Davenport met on a regular basis with staff to keep them informed and the CEOs of the three hospitals held ongoing meetings to determine where and when to transfer patients and staff with the least disruptions to continuity of care. The decision was made to move the Adolescent and Geriatric units to Spring Grove as this location was more accessible to families while the long term unit went to Springfield as the impact on families was less for this patient group. The Intermediate Unit and the Forensic Admissions Unit went to Spring Grove while the Civil Admissions Unit went to Springfield. Staff placement notifications were made in February, followed by patients and families being informed in April of their transfer location. Everyone was reassured that staff on the unit was accompanying the patients being transferred from those units and further reassurances were given by providing tours of the other hospitals for staff and patients.
Despite these efforts, some staff continued to be anxious about their duties at the new hospital while others were pleased with how the transition was handled. Ms. Davenport acknowledged that this was a difficult time for Crownsville staff and complimented them on their dedication to their patients during and after the transition. Currently, most staff has remained in their new positions though some are still adjusting to their new environments at Springfield and Spring Grove.
From a Washington Post story, Sept. 16, 2004:
A forlorn cemetery where the weatherworn tombstones lie flat and bear numbers instead of names was dedicated last week as a sanctuary that state officials vowed to preserve. Nelson J. Sabatini, the Maryland Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene, on Friday said the hundreds of people buried at Crownsville Hospital Center would not be forgotten, even if their identities won't ever be known. Founded in 1910 as the Hospital for the Negro Insane, the hospital interred its patients during the early part of the century on a rolling hill on the grounds. But often it didn't mark their names on the tombstones.
No one is entirely sure why the dead were buried anonymously. Some officials thought perhaps the numbers on the tombstones corresponded to those on long-lost patient files. Others, including local historian Janice Hayes-Williams, thought family members did not want it known they had relatives who were mentally ill.
Backed by a team of volunteers, Williams has spent months going through death records, trying to record the names of the people who died at Crownsville. ""Who were these people?"" she said earlier this year. ""Where did they come from? That's what we're trying to find out."" The legislature, lobbied by Hayes-Williams and others, passed a bill to preserve the cemetery. On Friday, a plaque commemorating those who are buried at Crownsville was unveiled at the site. And, in an interview this week, Sabatini said there is a ""commitment to preserve and treat this place with dignity and respect.""

Maryland,Eastern Shore State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Eastern_Shore_State_Hospital,1912,November 1913,"May 18, 1915",Active,Cottage Plan,"firm of Parker, Thomas & Rice",Eastern Shore Hospital Center (Current) | Eastern Shore State Hospital for Insane | Cambridge Hospital | Cambridge State Hospital,"The Eastern Shore State Hospital for the Insane, located at Cambridge, Md., was authorized in the bond issue bill passed bj. the General Assembly of 1912. The Board of Managers, as given, was mentioned in the bill. The board at its first meeting elected Governor Goldsborough as president, J. Hooper Bosley, as secretary and treasurer, and Dr. Charles J. Carey, formerly assistant physician at the Springfield State Hospital, as the superintendent. The first duty of the board was to select a location. A committee consisting of the Governor, Comptroller and Senator Bosley visited numerous sites which had been proposed and finally recommended to the board one of three desirable farms in the immediate vicinity of Cambridge. The entire Board of Managers with the Lunacy Commission visited these farms and finally decided upon the Kirwan estate, located about a mile from Cambridge, on the banks of the beautiful Choptank River. This farm consists of about 250 acres, a part of which is wooded, the remainder being first-class farm land.
The board at its next meeting decided to have an architectural competition for plans for the building. Mr. Marshall, of the firm of Hornblower & Marshall, of Washington, D. C, was selected as the consulting architect. The rules of the American Institute of Architects governing such a competition were adopted, and, after the necessary forms were completed, six architects were invited to take part in the competition. A jury consisting of Dr. Hugh H. Young, president of the Lunacy Commission, and Messrs. M. B. Medary, Jr., and E. A. Crane, two well-known architects of Philadelphia, were asked to serve. The drawings were submitted sealed and opened in the presence of the jury; each set of drawings having a number and, accompanying the drawings, a sealed envelope with the number on the outside and the name of the firm on the inside, so that no member of the jury would know the name of the architect in the competition. After the drawings had been carefully studied by the jury and the awards made the jury submitted a statement in writing to the Board of Managers. At a later meeting the envelopes containing the names of the contestants were opened. The name of the successful architect was found to be the firm of Parker, Thomas & Rice, to whom the award was given. This firm immediately began the preparation of the working plans for the building; contracts were awarded and ground broken in November, 1913. Dr. Carey assumed his duties in July, and on December 11, 1913, 24 patients, who were from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, were transferred from Springfield State Hospital to the Eastern Shore State Hospital.
Contracts were let for the buildings September, 1913, and building operations progressed steadily until the completion of the mess hall buildings, the laundry and the power house in March, 1915. The institution when fully completed will consist of 11 buildings, two mess hall buildings, six dormitories or cottages, a laundry building, power house, administration building and superintendent's house. The mess hall buildings are adjoining the kitchen building, with which they are connected by corridors, and contain serving rooms and three dining rooms. The kitchen, a detached building, is in the center between the two mess halls. The second stories of the mess halls contain, in addition to rooms for nurses and hospital employees, four large amusement or day rooms for patients, which in the present unfinished condition of the building are used as dormitories. The building is heated throughout by the hot-water expansion system, where the water is heated by the exhaust and live steam from the power plant through a system of converters or hot-water generators, the exhaust or waste steam being sufficient to heat the building except in very cold weather, when live steam must be added.
The kitchen is thoroughly modern in every respect. There is also an ice plant, of a capacity of two tons of ice per day, adjoining the kitchen; also a bakery and laundry. The power house is supplied with two large Edgemoor water-tube boilers, and the engine house has large electrical generators. The water supply is obtained from an 8-inch artesian well sunk to a depth of 415 feet, which supplies 180 gallons of water per minute. The mess halls are constructed of rough brick with tooled joints and are trimmed with Indiana sandstone. The second story is finished in stucco, with old English timber effect. The roof is of slate. The windows are protected with steel guards, the panels of which conform to the sizes of the lights and the sashes and are filled with copper wire screens. All floors throughout the building are of reinforced concrete. The finished floors of the first story are of Welsh tiles; the finished floors of the second story of Georgia pine. All interior walls throughout the building are finished with soft-glazed bricks of a brownish-gray color. All partitions are built from gypsum and plaster. The floors of the bathrooms, toilet rooms and laboratories are laid with terrazzo. Fire protection is provided by one Worthington fire pump of 500 gallons capacity per minute, the water supply being taken from a creek back of the power house. At present one of the dining room wings of the mess hall is fitted up for temporary offices.
The two cottages on the property have been repaired and put in good condition. Sanitary plumbing and new heating equipment have also been installed, thus affording accommodations for the 24 patients, the superintendent and nurses. On May 18, 1915, 203 patients, whose residence was upon the Eastern Shore of Maryland, were transferred from the different state hospitals.[1]

The physical growth of hospital buildings continued for several decades and the average daily population increased steadily to 675-680 patients in 1956. By the early 1970s, the patient census had dropped to approximately 420, primarily due to a focused effort on deinstitutionalization. On July 1, 1973, the Eastern Shore State Hospital became known as the Eastern Shore Hospital Center (ESHC). ESHC has been fully accredited since May 1967. In November 1993, the hospital moved from assigning patients to their units by geography to a treatment oriented system. In the mid-1990s, the hospital’s site was considered for public economic development. In order to allow for development while continuing to provide necessary mental health services, another site of land was purchased and funding was appropriated to build a new ESHC.[3] The original 351 acre hospital and it's 38 buildings were demolished in 1999. The land that the hospital once sat on is now a golf course and Hyatt hotel resort. The new hospital is located a few miles south, just outside of Cambridge, MD on Woods Road.

The facility was established in 1922 as a tuberculosis hospital for the “Negro” population. In July of 1963 the hospital was transferred to the Department of Mental Hygiene and was converted to a special training and habilitation program for severely retarded, ambulatory adults. Admission was handled through Rosewood State Hospital. Occupancy was to be 400 once when conversion was completed. Henryton closed in 1985.
The Henryton campus consists of eighteen buildings, with a total of 228,000 square feet. The campus is located on 46 acres in the middle of a State Park. The main buildings at Henryton include three connecting multi-story structures, built between the 1920’s and 1940, containing approximately 119,000 square feet. The earliest building comprised the original tuberculosis hospital. Two additions were built and renovations were made to the original building between the time of the original construction and 1940. There are also five support buildings located nearby. These were built between 1936 and 1952 and contain approximately 96,000 square feet. Seven small maintenance buildings or sheds scattered throughout the campus were constructed between the 1920’s and 1940 and have a total of 8,000 square feet of space. Finally, there are three other maintenance buildings constructed between 1957 and 1960.
Henryton has become a popular hangout for vandals, scrappers, and taggers. Since it's closure, the hospital has suffered greatly and is currently only a shell of its former self. On Dec 19, 2007 80 Firefighters from three counties responded to a large fire in the auditorium. Because of the unsafe nature of the building, firefighters could only control the fire from the exterior. The auditorium and cafeteria have both since been demolished. Demolition of the entire facility began in June 2013 and is expected to be completed by August 2013. The former hospital site will be allowed to return to nature as part of the state park that surrounds it.

The hospital campus, as originally constructed in 1922-1924, consists of seven buildings: the main hospital building, the administration building, the kitchen, the nurses’ home, the laundry with servants’ quarters above, the garage, and the power house. In 1939, a residence for the Director of Medical Research was added at the west end of the campus. The campus was designed by noted Baltimore architect Edward Hughes Glidden, Sr. Its institutional-scale, buff brick buildings with stone and terra-cotta trim are presented in the Italian Renaissance Revival style, characteristic of the 1920s. The buildings are placed within a campus-like setting with the main hospital building serving as the anchor from which the other buildings are located throughout the grounds. The administration building and the kitchen are positioned as two projecting wings from the hospital building, creating a collegiate setting. Walkways and courtyards lead to the other buildings sited more informally and slightly separated from this main grouping of buildings. After the hospital closed in 1949, the site was assumed by the Montebello State Chronic Disease Hospital. Several buildings were constructed on the campus by the subsequent owners between 1954 and 1984.[1]  The hospital was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

Today, the site known as Pine Bluff, has been subdivided into separate properties with this parcel only including the Gordy Building. Of the 4 original buildings, only the Gordy building and the Chief Medical Officers residence, which is on a separate property, remain. The facility was purchased by the State of Maryland in 1925, becoming the second state-owned health facility on the Eastern Shore and continued to operate as a Tuberculous Sanitarium until 1972.
The facility was re-purposed to serve as an annex to Deer's Head Hospital for a few years after its closing as a Sanitarium, however this was short-lived and was again repurposed to house the offices of the Maintenance of Aged in the Community (MAC) and Shore Up's daycare for the elderly. In 1975, Senator Homer White, working with the MAC program, proposed conducting a study to convert the facilities into a residential care center for the elderly. Through negotiations, a plan to create Pine Bluff Village for the Elderly was approved in 1977, however, the new plans did include renovating the Gordy Building. Today the Pine Bluff Village occupies approximately 20 acres and consists of modem, affordable residential apartment structures for the elderly.",1977,"Salisbury, MD",,
Maryland,Springfield State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Springfield_State_Hospital,1894,1896,July 1896,Active,Cottage Plan,,Springfield Hospital Center,"In 1894, the Legislature of the State of Maryland addressed the issue of overcrowding of the one state operated psychiatric hospital by creating a search committee charged with finding a site for the erection of the “Second Hospital for the Insane of Maryland”. This legislation was proposed by John Hubner of Baltimore County.
After reviewing a number of potential sites, the committee selected Springfield, the estate of the Patterson-Brown? family. At the time of this selection, Springfield was owned by Governor Frank Brown, a descendant of the William Patterson family, a wealthy colonial era farmer and merchant. William Patterson’s daughter, Elizabeth, or “Betsy”, gained international fame and notoriety when she married Jerome Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon Bonaparte. This courtship, and the ill-fated marriage that followed has been the subject of numerous books and at least one movie. Information about the Patterson and Brown families can be found in the Springfield Hospital Center Museum and the Maryland Historical Society.
The first patients were received at the hospital in July 1896. Existing farm houses were renovated to accommodate those first patients while the hospital buildings were being constructed. The first phase of the building program was the Men’s Group, located in the northern section of the hospital grounds. A Women’s Group, located at the southern end of the campus was completed in 1900. As the hospital population rapidly expanded, additional buildings were erected, including the John Hubner Psychopathic Building, the Epileptic Colony, and significant expansions to the Men’s and Women’s Groups.
Other structures were built to support the clinical areas. A powerhouse was constructed to supply domestic water needs as well as steam for heating. A large farm operation supplied most of the food consumed by patients and staff. A railroad line to Sykesville was built, and a small train was acquired to haul fuel and supplies. Additional structures were added to support the needs of the hospital, such as maintenance buildings, central dietary and storeroom, firehouse, and employee housing. Springfield consists of three distinct patient complexes: the Martin Gross Group 1898-1932 (men), the Warfield Group 1900-1929 (women), and the Clark Circle Colony 1924-1935 (epileptic).
By the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the hospital population exceeded 3000. Units were overcrowded and staffing was inadequate to meet the needs of the patients. A series of newspaper articles in The Baltimore Sun, entitled “Maryland’s Shame”, examined these problems at all of the state operated psychiatric hospitals. As a result of these articles and a heightened awareness by the public of the needs of the mentally ill, additional funding for staffing and capital improvements was made by the Maryland Legislature. At Springfield Hospital Center, this effort resulted in the construction of many new buildings, and renovations to all existing buildings to remedy the overcrowding.
It was during this time that Springfield Hospital Center became the nationwide model for a new concept in treating the mentally ill. Under the direction of Miss Henrietta DeWitt?, Director of Social Work, the concept of foster care-placing discharged patient in family homes-began and was rapidly adopted by other States.
In the mid 1950’s, new medications were introduced which had a profound effect on the future of this and all other psychiatric hospitals. For the first time, many patients were able to return to live in their communities. The trend of increasing census was reversed, and the number of patients requiring inpatient treatment began declining. In the 1960’s, there was an effort begun to serve the mentally ill in community-based treatment centers. Springfield was in the forefront of that effort by establishing one of the first outpatient centers in Baltimore City. During the 1960’s, the State of Maryland ended the practice of admitting patients to various hospitals based on their race. Springfield Hospital Center became fully integrated during this time period.
During the 1970’s, the concept of deinstitutionalization was introduced. A concerted effort was made to provide patients with the skills necessary to reenter the community. Multidisciplinary teams were formed to coordinate these efforts, which resulted in many units becoming vacant for the first time as patients successfully transitioned back to independent or assisted living situations. As the census continued its decline and units were emptied, new construction continued to replace the nearly one hundred year-old buildings. The Muncie Center for Adolescents and the Irene Hitchman Building were constructed, utilizing state of the art treatment concepts in their construction.
In the 1980’s, further emphasis was placed on the rapid evaluation and treatment for newly admitted patients and fostering the rehabilitation of the chronically mentally ill. Units were downsized, and long range planning focused on attention to the development of the hospital along Fourth Street. With the opening of the Eva Salomon Building in the late 1980’s, this plan was finalized, with all of the major inpatient units clustered on Fourth Street. The result was a smaller hospital with easy access to all services required by our patients in one centralized area. Another “first” for Springfield Hospital Center was the opening of our Deaf Unit, which is the only unit in the State of Maryland for deaf or hard of hearing patients who have mental health issues.
In 1996, Springfield Hospital Center celebrated 100 years of providing mental health services to the citizens of Maryland. Activities were held each month, beginning with the dedication of the Museum in January. As we approached the millennium, Springfield Hospital Center continued its mission of providing comprehensive treatment in an environment that is responsive to all elements of human dignity.
Plans for the future include ongoing performance improvement initiatives for upgrading the already outstanding care that our patients receive. New buildings and programs are in the planning phase to help keep us in the forefront of psychiatric health care services. Springfield Hospital Center is proud to be fully accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health care Organizations, as well as being licensed by the State of Maryland, and approved by various federal regulatory agencies.[1]

This was the cemetery used for burial of patients by the Springfield State Hospital between 1899-1961. The graves are marked only with small numbered stones, there are about 900 graves.
In 2012, it took staff and volunteers about eight years of tedious research through copious dusty records, often illegible, written in faded ink or pencil, to name the dead. It meant checking and cross-checking several references to match the names with the numbers, said Paula Langmead, Springfield's superintendent.  These researchers found that Osbourne Broadwater was the last patient buried at Sunny Side in 1962.  His name was the last of 908 names on an imposing granite and bronze stone dedicated Tuesday at the cemetery ""to the memory of beloved residents laid to rest.""",,"Sykesville, Maryland",Beaux Arts/Neo-Colonial/Georgian Revival,
Maryland,Spring Grove State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Spring_Grove_State_Hospital,1797,1853,"October 7, 1872",Active,Kirkbride Plan,J. Crawford Neilson,Spring Grove Hospital Center | Captain Yellott's Retreat | Hospital for Strangers and Mariners | Hospital for Seamen and Mariners | Public Hospital of Baltimore | The Maryland Hospital,"The ""Old Main"" was the original building at the Spring Grove site of the Maryland Hospital for the Insane. Although construction was started in 1853, the Main Building was not substantially completed and ready for full occupancy until 1872. Work on the building stopped in 1862 and was not resumed until 1868. However, enough of the north wing was completed by the start of the Civil War (1861) to allow for that part of the building to serve as a military hospital during the War. The first psychiatric patients were transferred from the Baltimore City location of the Maryland Hospital to the newly completed facility at Spring Grove on October 7, 1872.
The Main Building's original capacity was 325 patients, and its cost, including landscaping and several associated outbuildings, was approximately $760,000. From the beginning, the Main Building had running water, flush toilets, gas lighting and forced air central heating. Hot water for a heat exchanger was piped to the building's basement from a nearby Boiler House. Electric lights and a telephone system were added in the 1890s. (Combination gas and electric chandeliers may be seen in some pictures from the turn of the 19th Century.) The Main Building was designed in accordance with the Kirkbride Plan, which called for a monumental center section, and two large wings — one for male patients and one for females patients. The north wing was called the ""Male Department,"" and the south wing was called the ""Female Department."" The individual units on each wing were arranged in a progressive set-back configuration, a system that allowed for the classification of patients by level of functioning, and kept the various levels of care (""Violent Female,"" ""General Female,"" ""Convalescent Female,"" ""Violent Male,"" ""General Male"" and ""Convalescent Male"" ) fairly separate from each other.
Although there were several major expansions of the building in later years, originally it had 18 patient care units or ""wards"" (later called ""Halls"") — three floors, with three units en echelon on each floor of each wing. The central section of the building, referred to in early records as the ""Centre Building,"" included administrative offices and other central elements such as the kitchen and the Amusement Hall.
Sadly, the ""Old Main"" was demolished in 1964, and all that's left of the original complex is the Boiler House - the northern section of today's laundry building. The Main Building stood on the lot across the street from the current Spring Grove Administration Building, and extended north to beyond where the Jamison Building stands today. The circular lawn seen in front of the Main Building in the above picture exists today as the ""island"" at the center of the traffic circle near today's Administration Building on Ash Street.
Although today it is difficult for some of us to understand why the historic significance and architectural merit of the Main Building didn't save it from the wrecking ball back in 1963, the fact is that, in 1963, the building was structurally unsound, was justifiably considered to have been a ""firetrap,"" and was felt to have been beyond reasonable repair. Its wooden floor joists, some of which dated back to 1853, reportedly were rotten and at risk of collapsing; and it's heating, plumbing and electrical systems were dangerously outdated. Furthermore, its monolithic design was badly out of step with the needs and sensibilities of a modern psychiatric hospital; and, in the days before ""condo's"" and ""loft apartments"" it probably wouldn't have lent itself to adaptive reuse.
Much of the rubble of the Main Building is located just under the soil of the open field that lies behind the Jamison Building, between the modern day Spring Grove Administration Building and the Laundry Building, and some of it was deposited as landfill behind the Hamilton Building (which was extant at the time that the Main Building was demolished). Occasionally, even to this day, small subterranean sections of the remains of the Main Building, such as portions of its air shafts or basement rooms, will collapse and cause slight indentations to appear on the surface — a subtle reminder, perhaps, that the Main Building hasn't passed entirely from our midst.
The hospital is now officially known as Spring Grove Hospital Center (renamed in 1973) and under the governance of the  Mental Hygiene Administration, the facility operates 330 beds and provides advanced  inpatient psychiatric services to approximately 1000 patients every year.  Spring Grove is fully accredited by the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO), was recently awarded commendation status by that Aerial View of Spring Grove Hospital Center, 1992 organization, and maintains a major teaching affiliation with the University of Maryland. The Center is also the host site of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, a world-renowned research institution that focuses on identifying the causes and cure for schizophrenia.[1]

The site contains approximately 500 acres. Most of the 30 buildings are within a security fence. The administration building is just inside the fence, with residential cottages along a loop drive farther from the gate. A gymnasium and modular school building are near the center of the campus. The administration building, the Cullen Building, was constructed in 1946.

Maryland,Rosewood State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Rosewood_State_Hospital,1888,,1889,Closed,Cottage Plan,Jackson C. Gott/J. Crawford Nielson,Rosewood State Training School | Rosewood Asylum | Rosewood Training School for the Feeble Minded | Rosewood Center,"The Maryland Asylum and Training School for Feeble-minded was incorporated by the General Assembly in 1888, and its name was changed by the General Assembly of 1912 to Rosewood State Training School. It is a permanent charitable institution, owned and entirely supported by the State of Maryland.
The movement to establish a training school for feeble-minded patients had its origin largely in the efforts of Dr. Richard Gundry, then superintendent of the Spring Grove State Hospital, who in several reports called the attention of the state to the great need of doing something for the care and training of feeble-minded children. In consequence of his initiative, much interest was developed in several public-spirited philanthropists, among whom were Dr. J. Pembroke Thom, Gen. Herman Stump and Milton G. Urner. A small appropriation was obtained to establish such a school in the former residence of Dr. Wood, of the Navy, near Owings Mills, known as Rosewood. The first superintendent was Miss Martha M. Gundry, a daughter of Dr. Gundry, who, with a single teacher, opened the school in a small way in 1888. Miss Gundry continued in responsible charge for several years, and resigned to establish a school in Virginia. She was succeeded by several medical gentlemen, who held the office for comparatively brief periods. Dr. Thom continued much interested, and two of the cottages, Pembroke and Thom, bear his name. Gen. Herman Stump and Milton G. Urner are still connected with the board. Later the full development of the institution resulted in the appointment of Dr. F. W. Keating, who has been responsible for its work for the past 16 years.
The object of the institution is to furnish a home and a practical education for the feeble-minded children of the state who are not provided for in the public schools. Many children are of such defective understanding as to render them incapable of receiving proper training in the public schools, where they are brought into competition with those of normal intellect and where they cannot receive the especial care and attention absolutely necessary to secure mental development. In most instances they require training specially adapted to their condition, or they will become a burden upon their friends or the community; but by receiving kind and painstaking care and tuition at the hands of competent, experienced persons many of them become partly self-supporting under proper supervision. To care for and train such children to accomplish the results indicated, is the purpose of this institution.
Rosewood is situated about one-half mile from Owings Mills, in Baltimore County,. and is accessible by the Western Maryland Railroad and the Emory Grove electric cars. It is in the Green Spring Valley, and is beautifully and healthfully located upon a farm of 537 acres of land.
Children between the ages of 7 and 17 years who, by reason of mental defect, cannot be educated in ordinary schools, and who are not insane or greatly afflicted or deformed physically, are admitted into the institution free of charge for board and tuition, upon evidence being furnished of their inability to pay. Reasonable compensation is charged to those able to pay. It has a capacity of 700 children.
The group of buildings consists of a main or administration building and cottages which have been added from time to time, furnishing accommodation for 492 inmates, a school building and the necessary farm structures. In addition a custodial building for girls of low-grade type was completed in the spring of 1914, providing additional accommodations for 260 girls. This building is furnished with dormitories, day rooms, toilet and bath rooms, dining rooms and a scullery. On the first and second floors are large sleeping porches and in the basement is a large play room, which is used in inclement weather. The third floor is occupied by the nurses and attendants in the building, each having a separate bedroom, with a general sitting room for their comfort when not on duty with the children.
In the same year other improvements were made on the grounds. Two new stone barns and a large terra cotta silo were erected to replace old wooden structures, at a total cost of $10,584.41. An attractive stone gate lodge, with stone gateway, was also completed, at a cost of $3554, which adds greatly to the appearance of this entrance to the grounds.
The majority of the patients admitted are children under 15 years of age, at a time when they are susceptible of improvement by school instruction.
In the school department much attention is paid to manual training for the more advanced pupils and to kindergarten instruction for the younger ones. Each child is accorded the full advantages of class-room training when he or she is admitted to the institution within the limits of the school age. In the household department, sewing room, dining room, kitchen and laundry the work is entered into with much interest on the part of the patients. Their desire is great to do "" something like work,"" and the improvement made in this branch of their training calls for still greater effort in the future, for such training saves them from a life of idleness and is one of the most important factors in developing the feebleminded along lines of economic efficiency.
The farming and clearing of land have been of substantial benefit to the boys, and the good derived from this work cannot be too highly estimated. The produce raised on the farm has furnished the institution with a supply of fresh vegetables at all seasons. The entire supply of milk is obtained from the school's own herd, and a great deal of the fresh meat has been obtained from the live stock fattened and butchered on the farm. During the biennial period of 1913-14 the market value of the farm products aggregated $32,923.63; also the value at local prices of work performed by farm teams in hauling and excavating would amount to $3977.10. The work on the farm furnishes one of the most effective means of developing, both mentally and physically, the boys committed to the institution. Some of those most useful on the farm were able to accomplish practically nothing in the school room, but the outdoor occupation seems to render them particularly docile and happy.
The per capita expense for maintenance during the period of 1913-14 was $4.58 weekly, an increase of 15 cents per patient over the preceding biennial period, which increase is due to the advance in the market price of many supplies and the general increase in the wages of employees.[1]
SUPERINTENDENTS
Between the 1950s and 1970s, as in many similar state-run institutions in the United States, there were numerous reports of malpractice, neglect and abuse. In 1981, the U.S. Justice Department declared that residents at Rosewood ""failed to receive minimally adequate care"".[3] Further investigations proved positive leading to the older hospital buildings being vacated and condemned in 1989.
The original administration building was destroyed by fire in a 2006 case of arson, the building had been vacant at the time of the fire. Another fire destroyed an additional vacant building on Sunday, March 8, 2009, the building had previously been approved for demolition, so firefighters allowed the building to burn rather than attempt to put it out.[4] The Maryland State Fire Marshal investigated the fire as possible arson.[5]
January 2008, Governor O'Malley announced a phased closure of the Rosewood Center. The decision to close Rosewood followed the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's report Rosewood Center - Plan for Services to Residents. The report concluded that the vast majority of individuals who currently live at Rosewood could be served in the community. The report also identified the need for secure facilities and specific programs designed to meet the needs of the individuals with developmental disabilities committed to DHMH by the courts.[6] The State of Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene closed Rosewood on June 30, 2009. As of June 8, 2017, Stevenson University has announced that they were granted permission to acquire the Rosewood Center. Their plans include the development of the area to turn it into an educational and athletic site for SU students.

Maryland,Bayview Hospital and Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Bayview_Hospital_and_Asylum,1773,,,Active,Single Building,,Baltimore City and County Alms House | Bay View Asylum | Baltimore City Hospitals | Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center,"The following is from the 1866 book ""The stranger in Baltimore"": The Bay View Asylum, a new institution for the paupers of the city, is the first prominent object that strikes the eve of the traveler as he approaches the city on the Philadelphia Uailroad. The building is exceedingly imposing in appearance, and situated upon a hill high enough to render it conspicuous for many miles. Some $500,000 have been expended on the premises, and every rare and modern appliance afforded to render the Asylum and its grounds equal to the best in the world. The wings and centre building give an aggregate front of 714 feet, whilst it is three stories in height, including the basement. It is built of Baltimore brick of excellent quality, and, when completed, will have a massive entrance of granite with a roof and entablature supported by four large fluted columns, which will present an imposing Appearance, and give an air of completeness and solidity to the whole. One striking feature of the interior is the main hall of the principal story, which extends the entire length of the structure, is of unusual height, and supplied with tessellated marble flooring. This hall, as well as those above it, 'Communicate by spacious doorways to nearly all the principal rooms, and thereby contributes much to the ventilation, a very i-desirable feature in so large a building. Ample space has been . jxeserved for the accommodation of the officers and others 'i engaged in the house. The centre hall, which crosses the building, is well lighted, and contains the stairways which conduct both below and above. To the right of the hall is a spacious rApartment in which the Board of Trustees transact their business, whilst opposite is what is styled the reception parlor, . about 50 feet square.
The principal and most important feature in the building is the admirable manner in which it is heated and ventilated. 'There are four horizontal return-flue boilers, each 30 feet long .-•and 4 feet in diameter, set in massive brick work, supported by iiron guilders from the top. Only two boilers are necessarily rused at the same time, whilst all are located on the north side of the centre building, and beyond the laundry and kitchen; all of which are separate and distinct from the main building; From the boilers run large main steam pipes, which diverge in every direction, and supply the numerous coils placed in the halls and rooms. The construction of the coils used is different from the old style, being vertical, with substantial and handsome manifold bases for the bottom and return heads for the top. The temperature of every room is easily controlled by the engineer. The condensed steam from each coil is returned to the engine for use in the boilers. The ventilation is produced by the stack, which measures in the clear 13 feet in diameter, and is 125 feet high. The ventilating Hues from the entire building connect with this stack, the air in the same being rarified by the heat from the boiler stacks. The plumbing has been done in the best manner, all the piping being galvanized wrought iron, which is proof against gnawing irits. The laundry arrangements are of the most perfect character, steam, of course, being the great agent used. One twelve-horse power engine propels the machinery, and an independent boiler is provided for summer use, when.the large boilers are not wanting.
The principal arrangement for ventilation is a large stack of brick, the foundation of which is on a ltvel with the superstructure, while the top ascends above the roof, thereby passing a continual current of air. The top of the cupola rises to the height of 184 feet, whilst the base is estimated at ln7 feet above tide-water. From the top a magnificent panoramic view of scenery is presented, including the harbor, bay and river, the. fortifications and the entire city. The superintending architect of the building was John W. Hogg, Esq. More than seven millions of brick have been used in the work of erection.
The grounds consist of forty-six acres, which were purchased of the Canton Company at the rate of $150 per acre. and they will be kept in the highest style of cultivation, the better class of inmates doing the work as far as possible. There are now in the wards 716, and the general health is reported unusually good.
The principal management of fitting it up for occupation, was performed by W. W. MaughIin, James McDougal, William Callow, A. W. Poulson and James F. Ross, E.<qs., trustees appointed by the Mayor, whose labors, though gratuitous, were of the utmost advantage to the city in point of economy and completeness. Water is conveyed from Mount Royal Reservoir, a distance of five and a half miles, at an expense for pipes, &c.t of over $65,000. Permits tor visitors must be .obtained from the Trustees.[1]
Bayview began life in 1773 as the Baltimore City and County Alms House. Situated on what is now Baltimore’s east side, near where Maryland General Hospital is today, it was repeatedly pushed to the fringes of urban development. It landed on its present site, a rolling parcel of land far to the southeast of the city and overlooking the Chesapeake Bay, in 1866 when it came to be known as Bay View Asylum. It housed the poor and insane and was known as a dreaded, sinister place. Bay View was a name Baltimore mothers evoked when they disciplined their children, as in, “If you don’t behave, you’re going to wind up at Bay View!”
The link with Johns Hopkins was forged in the mid-1880s, even before its hospital opened, when William Welch, University pathologist, began studying Bay View Asylum patients in his research. Later, medical students from Hopkins joined University of Maryland students doing clinical rotations there.
In 1925 Bay View Asylum was renamed Baltimore City Hospitals—plural because it encompassed three separate hospitals: one for acute care, another for chronic care, and a third for tuberculosis patients. Psychiatric patients continued on at City Hospitals up through the 1930s when they were admitted to state institutions.
In the 1950s, City Hospitals was bursting at the seams with patients. Beds in its long, open wards were spaced about 10 feet apart and separated by curtains. It was now a teaching venue exclusively for Hopkins medical students, as Maryland had pulled out of its City Hospitals arrangement. Programs Bayview would become famous for, such as gerontology under Nathan Shock and later Mason Lord, were thriving. The National Institute on Aging’s Gerontology Research Center opened in 1968, the same year that community support from the Kiwanis’ Club established the now renowned Baltimore Regional Burn Center.
Cities throughout the United States were struggling in the 1970s and 1980s to maintain their municipal hospitals, and Baltimore was no exception. Run by municipal bureaucrats who knew little about hospital administration, City Hospitals was on the brink of financial disaster.
A bright light was Chesapeake Physicians, one of the first faculty practice plans in the country. When it was established in 1972, revenue for physicians and medical staff began flowing in.
And yet, by 1980, Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer was exploring bids from for-profit health care companies to take over City Hospitals, which was losing millions annually. Meanwhile, Chester Schmidt, president of Chesapeake Physicians, and Philip Zieve, chief of medicine, were lobbying The Johns Hopkins Hospital to acquire their besieged, but still promising, institution.
In fact, City Hospitals had what Hopkins wanted: Chesapeake Physicians, the region’s only burn unit, kidney dialysis and transplant programs, a long-term care facility, a couple of federal research centers, hundreds of teaching beds—not to mention 134 acres of land. Fearing competition from a for-profit hospital, Robert Heyssel, then president of Hopkins Hospital, and Richard Ross, dean of the medical school, reasoned that the acquisition might make sense—if Hopkins could manage City Hospitals successfully for a trial period and reduce its deficits.
In 1982, under a contract with the city, Hopkins assumed management of City Hospitals and sent a trio of young hospital administrators out to run it. Ronald Peterson, William Ward and Kenneth Grabill dramatically reduced City Hospital’s multimillion-dollar deficits. In 1983, University and Hospital trustees voted unanimously to start negotiations to take over City Hospitals.
Negotiating the deal with Schaefer, Heyssel played hardball. Under the terms of the agreement, the city promised to pay Hopkins $5.4 million over the next four years to cover part of the $8.4 million needed for improvements. Hopkins would loan the remaining $3 million to the city. The city and Hopkins would split profits from developing City Hospitals’ land over the next 20 years. Remarkably, if Hopkins could not operate City Hospitals successfully after five years, it could give it back.
In the end, Hopkins never put a dime of its own into the deal. (It was able to cover its portion of the upgrade expenses with revenue generated at City Hospitals.) Negotiations were concluded in March 1984; the transfer of ownership was effective July 1. City Hospitals was renamed the Francis Scott Key Medical Center, with Peterson its president. Soon thereafter, he added Judy Reitz to the management team.
Today the Bayview Medical Center is a 700-bed community teaching hospital with federal research institutes, nationally known programs and regional centers. Its impact on southeast Baltimore City and County is immeasurable. Its nationally known geriatrics program provides hundreds of elderly people with residential and outpatient care. It houses Maryland’s only burn center, an area-wide trauma center, comprehensive substance abuse programs, a digestive diseases/motility center, and regional centers for neonatal intensive care and sleep disorders.
In the 20 years since the takeover, admissions, surgical procedures and clinic visits have risen consistently. Approximately 2,000 employees have been added to the payroll. Buildings and grounds have been transformed. The campus now is modern and vibrant. Most significantly, considering Hopkins’ worries as it hammered out the City Hospitals deal, Bayview has been in the black.[2]

Maryland,Brook Lane Psychiatric Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Brook_Lane_Psychiatric_Center,1946,,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Brook Lane Farm Hospital | Brook Lane Health Services,"Brook Lane was established in 1946 by the Mennonite Central Committee in response to their awareness of a lack of compassion for the mentally ill. The Mennonite Central Committee was originally developed to be (and is to this day) the relief, development and peace committee of the Mennonite and Brethren in Christ churches in Canada and the United States.
It took two years to transform a 115 acre Civilian Public Service Camp into a 23 bed psychiatric hospital, converting previous barracks into office space, and renovating a farm house into a kitchen, dining room and staff dormitory. This “new” establishment opened its doors in January, 1949, amongst the rolling hills and farmland of the Leitersburg area.
In the early years staff was almost exclusively volunteers and conscientious objectors. They worked side by side with the patients, sharing the gardening, cooking, baking, and laundry as well as farming and maintenance. Staff and patients joined together for meals and recreational activities to enhance a therapeutic environment. The hospital maintained a full census and in 1954 an additional wing increased the bed capacity to 38.
Brook Lane Farm Hospital incorporated in 1959 and became a free standing, not-for-profit organization, continuing its affiliation with the Mennonite Church to include representatives of the local churches serving on the Board of Directors. Outpatient treatment was added to the program to continue meeting the needs of the community and in 1965 the name was changed to Brook Lane Psychiatric Center.
While primarily serving an adult population, Brook Lane recognized the importance of broadening services to include a younger population and in 1980 added an adolescent unit to the hospital. The demand grew and in 1987 a separate 30 bed hospital building was constructed to serve children and adolescents. In the early 1990’s Brook Lane began offering outpatient treatment at a satellite office, and at the same time created a special education program, Laurel Hall School, that eventually provided services to students of all ages.
In 1997 Brook Lane Psychiatric Center became Brook Lane Health Services as it continued to broaden the scope of its programs. The adult hospital was consolidated with the newer child and adolescent hospital in December of 1996. What was previously the adult hospital became a group home, Stone Bridge Transitional Care Home, in 1998, serving initially adolescents and then growing to include children. In 2004, that building was remodeled and expanded to once again house the inpatient unit, offering the privacy of individual patient rooms to enhance the healing process. The group home was then moved to the other building, sharing that space with the Laurel Hall School.
Brook Lane continues to follow the mission and vision of the Mennonite Central Committee’s initial petition to provide quality mental health services to those in the immediate community and beyond. The Board of Directors and the staff work together to meet the goal of maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all patients, students and residents in their care.[1]

Maryland,Chestnut Lodge Sanatarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Chestnut_Lodge_Sanitarium,,,1910,Demolished,Single Building,,,"In 1886, Charles G. Willson purchased five acres west of the town of Rockville, hired an architect, and began to build a large, four-story brick ""summer boarding house."" Before the building was completed, Willson filed for bankruptcy. Among those looking at the building were the Trustees of the Rockville Academy. The unfinished hotel and adjoining three acres were bought for $6,000 by Mary J. Colley, proprietress of the Clarendon Hotel in Washington, D.C., and her partner Charles W. Bell.
When the Woodlawn Hotel opened for business in the spring of 1889, it was an immediate success. Summer guests, many of whom were prominent D.C. residents, enjoyed social gatherings, musical soirees, card games, dances, walks among the trees and cool country breezes. Ads for the Woodlawn boasted electric bells, gas lighting, artesian water, fresh country vegetables, breezy porches, and 40 guest rooms. Visitors usually came by train, traveling the mile from the railroad station to the hotel by carriage.
Rockville's ""boom"" continued into 20th century, until a series of depressions deflated the economy. Many summer boarders, such as Edwin and Lucy Smith, decided to build year-round residences on lots in new subdivisions opening around Rockville. They liked living in a small town convenient to federal government jobs in Washington. However, by 1906, the Woodlawn's owners, heavily in debt, had to sell. The hotel, stable, windmill, ice house, carriage house, laundry and servants quarters, and eight acres went to public auction.
The hotel was purchased by Dr. Ernest L. Bullard, a surgeon and professor of psychiatry and neurology from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dr. Bullard renovated the hotel, by that time at the end of the trolley line. In 1910, he opened a sanitarium for the care of nervous and mental diseases, naming it for the 125 chestnut trees on the property. For many years, Dr. Bullard was the sole physician. For more than 75 years, three generations of Bullards operated Chestnut Lodge. The private hospital became known nationally for the quality of care and treatment, based upon the Bullards' philosophy that mental illness is treatable through a combination of psychoanalysis and occupational therapy. Well-known therapists, such as Frieda Fromm-Reichmann and Otto Will, joined the staff. Through the years, the Bullards added acreage and buildings to their property, and made their home at Rose Hill.
By 1997, Rockville had changed and so had the Bullard family. CPC Health, a nonprofit corporation, purchased the portion of Chestnut Lodge facing West Montgomery Avenue, but declared bankruptcy three years later. In 2001 it was purchased by the Washington Waldorf School (a small private K-12 school in Bethesda). In late 2003, real estate development firm Chase Communities purchased the property. It planned to build 43 single-family homes on the property prior to renovating the main building to accommodate seven luxury condominiums.
In February of 2006 the Rockville City Council voted to approve a Bethesda developer's plans to transform the grounds into 43 houses and condominiums worth at least $1 million each. Morton H. Levine's $45 million project has been widely supported in the community — a rarity these days — largely because residents say the developer convinced them that he would revive one of Rockville's most charming properties while respecting its past. Under Levine's plans, the property's main building will be restored to its former grandeur and house seven luxury condos. Two cottages, an ice house and an old red barn are also being restored. The rest of the property will be dotted with 36 Victorian-style homes, some with elevators. While the developer won battles to demolish an old, dilapidated nurses' residence and to forgo building a large park on the property, he must build an emergency access road that could be later turned into a street connecting the property with the nearby Rose Hill Community. Many Rose Hill residents argued vehemently against the road, fearing it would become a cut-through. Language in the approval documents stipulates that the Chestnut and Rose Hill homeowners associations would have to approve turning the road into a regular thoroughfare. Levine's plan will go to the Planning Commission, which will work out the nitty-gritty details of engineering, sewage and storm water management.
On June 7, 2009 a fire destroyed the original hotel/sanatorium building.

Maryland,Laurel Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Laurel_Sanatorium,1905,,,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,,"The Laurel Sanitarium was established in 1905 by Jesse C. Coggins, for nine years assistant physician at the Maryland Hospital, and Dr. Cornelius DeWeese, formerly assistant physician and pathologist at the Maryland Hospital for the Insane, and for four years physician-in-charge of the clinical laboratory of the Government Hospital in Washington.
The sanitarium is a private hospital for the care and treatment of nervous and mental diseases, alcoholic and drug addiction. It is located about one mile from Laurel, Md., and comprises five buildings.
The female building is a three-story frame structure, containing 30 bedrooms and five bathrooms, music room, library, three sun-parlors and spacious porches. The female annex, a twostory fireproof brick building, is situated near the main female building and is connected therewith by a fireproof corridor. This building contains 14 bedrooms and two bathrooms, one equipped with a continuous bath; it also has a sun-parlor and large porch.
The main building for men is a two-story frame building containing 36 bedrooms and six bathrooms. The gymnasium in the basement contains bowling alleys, billiard table, shuffle-board, rowing machine, punching bag and other exercises. Adjoining this room is the hydrotherapeutic room containing hot air cabinets, shower baths and massage tables.
The bungalow, a one-story frame structure, has six rooms, one bathroom and a sun-parlor.
The central or administration building is a three-story fireproof structure containing the offices, drug-room, examination room, record-room, store-room, central kitchen, five dining rooms, and eight bedrooms. All buildings are connected with the administration building by fireproof corridors, and are heated by a hot water system from the central heating plant in the fireproof basement of the administration building. The buildings and grounds are lighted by electricity ; the water supply is from the City of Laurel; the drinking water is supplied from an artesian well 325 feet deep.
The nursing is done by experienced nurses. Nurses are quartered on the third floor of their respective buildings. A night nurse of each service and an outside watchman are on duty at all times during the night.
A teacher is employed to teach the women needle-work, raffia, basket making, etc. In the men's group patients are employed at gardening, road-making and painting. The indoor amusements consist of musicales, cards, bowling, billiards and other games. Outdoor amusements are tennis, croquet and ball-playing.
The farm surrounding the sanitarium comprises 163 acres, which is laid out in walks, lawns, garden and fields; and the table is supplied from the herd, poultry yards and garden belonging to the institution.
The physicians-in-charge are Dr. Jesse C. Coggins and Dr. Cornelius DeWeese, owners and resident medical officers.
[1]
In 1970, what remained on the grounds of the sanitarium was finally bull-dozed. A large department store, then several other stores followed on the newly-leveled site. Over the years several apartments and housing complexes were constructed nearby. Today, nothing remains that would ever indicate that the Laurel Sanitarium existed.

Maryland,Mount Hope Retreat,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Mount_Hope_Retreat,1840,"July 2, 1859","July 8, 1860",Demolished,Kirkbride Plan,Long & Powell,Seton Institute | Mt. Hope | Mt. Hope Institution | Mount Hope Insane Asylum | Mount St. Vincent,"In 1840 the Sisters of Charity, because of some dissatisfaction on the part of the Board of Directors, severed their connection with the Maryland Hospital, where for several years they had been in charge of the insane inmates and where they had been eminently successful.
The Sisters moved their operations to a of their own, and 17 patients were at once placed in their care. Their first building was a small two-story brick house on Front Street, near Fayette, adjoining St. Vincent's Church. Dr. Durkee was then installed as medical attendant. This building soon proved insufficient and the Sisters were forced to seek more commodious accommodations. They finally purchased a lot improved by a frame building on the Harford Road, a short distance from the city limits, and called it Mount St. Vincent. This was arranged for the accommodation of patients, and the Sisters devoted themselves with renewed zeal and constantly increasing success to the good work they had undertaken. In 1842 Dr. William H. Stokes was invited to assume the medical charge of the new institution and his untiring energy, devotion and fidelity contributed greatly to its advancement and success. With the rapid growth of the institution, Mt. St. Vincent soon became overcrowded with patients, and the Sisters were compelled a second time to seek more ample quarters in order to meet the demand of those who appreciated their kindly care and attention.
In April, 1844, Mt. Hope College, situated in the vicinity of what is now North Avenue, Laurens, Park and Bolton streets, was purchased with its ample grounds from Mr. Treadwell by Rev. L. Deluol, who was then Superior of the order. On taking possession of this property the Sisters changed its name to Mt. Hope Institution. As it had been built as a college, it was found admirably adapted to the care of patients and the rooms and dormitories were very desirable. Several springs on the property afforded an ample supply of water, which was forced into the house by hydraulic rams.
After being repaired and enlarged this building, with its beautiful surroundings, situated at a convenient distance from the city, for many years formed a prominent feature among the institutions of Baltimore; its reputation soon became national, patients being received from all sections of the country. From time to time the structure was enlarged and extended to accommodate the unexpected influx of patients. The whole interior was remodeled and appliances were introduced which the humane spirit of the age deemed essential for the successful treatment of mental disease.
But it was not to rest here. Within a few years Mt. Hope in its turn became crowded, and this fact, together with the extension of streets and the rapid encroachment of the city on the privacy of patients, necessitated another removal. After an examination of numerous sites, it was decided to purchase the property on the Reisterstown Road, extending back to the Liberty Road, known as the Meredith Tract. This location, about one mile from the then city limits, possessed many advantages.
The new hospital was designed by Long & Powell, architects, under the direction of Rev. F. Burlando, then Superior of the Sisters of Charity. The foundation stone was laid by him on July 2, 1859. The first wing was completed in 1860, and on the 8th of July four Sisters took possession of it; their number was soon increased to 12, and the patients were removed from Mt. Hope Institution as fast as accommodations could be provided. The new home was known henceforth as Mt. Hope Retreat and under this title was incorporated in March, 1870.
The site selected is upon a knoll 40 feet above the main road and about a quarter of a mile distant from it, being about 550 feet above tide water, and embraces 375 acres. The front of the building faces the southeast and the view from this presents a bold, undulating slope through orchards, meadows and fields to a brook which winds through the low lands, emerging at the extreme southern border of the grounds, about a mile distant. The main entrance is approached by a gateway of granite and iron through an avenue of trees and shrubbery, passing in front of the east wing. The hospital consists of a main building and four extensive. wings. The former is five stories high, with an attic surmounted by a dome 160 feet from the ground, which affords a magnificent view of the city, the bay and the surrounding country. In the center or main building are located the reception rooms, the parlor, the billiard room, the Sisters' apartments, chapel, special private rooms, the dormitories for patients and the sewing rooms. The wings are appropriated to the exclusive use of patients. There are numerous out-buildings, among which are the doctor's cottage on the north, a handsome two-story brick gate house, two large pavilions on the west, the laundry, the work-shop and the ice and engine house; while on the farm are stone cottages occupied by the manager, the gardener, the engineer, the watchman and others employed on the place. All told, nearly 1000 souls represent the modest family which 52 years ago formed the nucleus of Mt. Hope Retreat. To the southeast, about three-quarters of a mile from the main building, is a lake. In close proximity to this lake are picnic grounds on which stands another cottage fitted up as a kitchen for picnic parties, where may be prepared lunch or dinner as may be desired for the patients who frequently pass whole days on these grounds, and thus secure a desirable and delightful change from the monotony of ""asylum"" life.
The records show that 10,587 patients were treated between the opening of the modest asylum on Front Street in 1840 and 1892. The professional care of the inmates was for 45 years under the direction of Dr. Wm. H. Stokes, an able and beloved physician. In 1872 he called to his assistance Dr. I. D. Thompson, who zealously served in this capacity until his failing health compelled him to resign in 1881, when Dr. Charles G. Hill was selected to take his place. In 1888 Dr. Stokes resigned and Dr. Charles G. Hill was made his successor. Dr. Richard McSherry was appointed assistant physician and filled the position for a year. Dr. W. P. E. Wyse was appointed in his place, and served until he resigned to engage in private practice in 1891. Dr. F. J. Flannery, who in 1881 had been appointed second assistant physician, became first assistant physician, which position he still fills.
The annual report for the year 1892, while recorded as the 50th, was in reality for the 52d year of continuous existence. Since then there has been issued, each year, an annual report.
Dr. William H. Stokes, for 45 years the chief physician of the institution, died during the year 1893 at the age of 84 years. In 1888, by reason of the infirmities due to his long service and advanced age, he had been compelled to resign as chief physician. It was Dr. W. H. Stokes who. having seen the employment of non-restraint methods under the famous Connolly and other alienists of Europe, introduced them into Mt. Hope Retreat.
A new wing was added to the institution this year, its dimensions being 58 by 78 feet, three stories high, with a one-story wing containing the bakery, 25 by 40 feet, and a covered passage to the ice-house. This building contains a large kitchen, Sisters' dining room, serving room, linen room and elevators from the kitchen and cellar. The third floor, 55 by 58 feet in the clear, is devoted to the amusement and entertainment of the patients, there being an ample stage, well provided with movable scenery, and two dressing rooms.
In 1894 a new barn was added to the already extensive outbuildings of the Retreat and the facility of supplying fresh milk and cream for the use of the patients was enhanced. The new entertainment hall afforded not only the means for giving numerous theatricals, concerts, lectures, and dances, but also a suitable place for large classes of calisthenics, Swedish movement exercises, etc. While this new hall is of advantage at all times, it is indispensable during the long winter months when the patients are unable to get out of doors. The physical exercises and massage afforded form a valuable adjunct to the treatment. .
The mortality for the year 1893 was 49, a very small percentage, the deaths recorded occurring principally among the old patients.
The training school for nurses reached its fourth year in 1895. During the year the classes were given weekly lectures by Drs. Hill and Flannery, at the same time they continued their courses under competent teachers who drilled them in bedside notes, the preparation of clinical charts and the chemical composition and preparation of foods. Hygienic laws were examined, together with the method and purposes of disinfection. All the nursing staff attended the lectures by the physicians and only graduates were exempted from the recitations.
Several important improvements were completed during the year. By increasing the steam power and enlarging the pipe capacity the storage reservoir is now amply supplied from the waters of an artificial lake, and the water supply is absolutely independent and unstinted. From this lake the winter harvest of ice is gathered and capacious storage houses are filled. The entire building was wired and electric lights installed, doing away with gas and other antiquated methods of lighting.
A new clinical laboratory, replete with every facility and appliance that science has devised for the investigation and diagnosis of disease, was built and equipped and is now in successful operation under the direction of a competent pathologist. By the aid of centrifuge and haematocrit, together with other mechanical and chemical adjuncts, examinations of blood, sputum, urine, stomach contents, etc., can now be made without delay and the diagnosis and treatment facilitated. This laboratory is not designed so much for investigation of diseased conditions found on postmortem examinations, as for the functional and organic disturbances of the living subject.
The report of the year 1896 shows a great increase in the population over previous years. The usual number per month averaged about 600. Owing to the success of the laboratory methods of treatment, a greater number of cures were effected and the discharges increased. The improvements made during this year were principally the completion of the new toilet rooms.
The laboratory has proved of great assistance, both in making the diagnosis and in suggesting the proper methods of treatment. Each new patient on entering is subjected to a thorough test as to the various secretions. A 24-hour analysis of the urine is made; blood is examined and the contents of the stomach, after the usual test meals, are likewise the subject of inspection and analysis.
During the year 1898 the laboratory was enlarged and many new instruments and appliances for diagnosis added.
Being chartered as a general hospital as well as an institution for the insane, many apply for treatment who are not confessedly insane, but suffering from some form of nervous or general disease or the drug habit, as well as a considerable number of inebriates who come and go as they feel the need of the protection and care of the institution. These, of course, are not under certificate, nor classified as insane, and come voluntarily.
Attention has been given of late to the possibilities and advantages of the cottage plan of housing and caring for the insane. Mt. Hope has this system practically under one roof, as there are 17 halls, each separate and distinct from the rest, governed by two Sisters and nurses and attendants. This subdivision allows each hall or family to maintain its own identity. The Sisters of Charity have entire control and charge of the institution and the physicians are not burdened with any clerical or administrative duties, and devote their entire attention to the examination and treatment of the patients.
The most important improvement during the year 1905 was the installation of a refrigerating plant and ice-making machine. The ice machine has a capacity of 500 pounds daily and the refrigerating plant takes care of the kitchen, bakery and storage rooms.
In 1906 the large parlors and waiting rooms were subdivided into smaller and more convenient rooms. This subdivision was forced upon the management by reason of the large and steady increase of patients seeking admission who wanted, when possible, the privacy of their own rooms.
In view of the fact that a certificate of graduation is required in many hospitals in this and other states, the usual course of lectures in the school for nurses was at this time made more systematic, and hereafter such as have completed their course and passed a satisfactory examination will be granted certificates setting forth their proficiency and graduation.
In 1907 a large amusement hall, with a capacity for seating 600, and with a well-equipped stage, was provided. Numerous plays have been given by the inmates as well as by outside talent. Two theatrical companies were organized, one from the women and the other from the men patients, who by constant drill and practice attained a surprising facility for the production of comedies and operas.
In 1908 the full equipment for making the Wassermann test was established.
During this year Sister Catharine, the beloved Sister Superior, who for 42 years had guided Mt. Hope, died. Sister Catharine left the hospital of the army in 1862 and returned to Mt. Hope. In 1867 she was made Superioress. During her administration Mt. Hope grew from the one wing that was then completed to the magnificent building that stands to-day. Her successor was Sister M. Magdalene, who after years spent as a nurse both in old and new Mt. Hope was sent to St. Louis to take charge of old St. Vincent's. She remained there 19 years and during that time built the new St. Vincent's Retreat at Normand, a suburb of St. Louis, finally coming back to the scene of her early labors.
In 1911 the new chapel was built, it being a four-story brick building, the second and third stories being devoted to chapel purposes, and the first and fourth stories to new dining and sleeping quarters. The old chapel was converted into large dormitories. Large concrete and iron porches and fire escapes have been added to each wing, affording open air exercises to many patients who are unable to go to the grounds.
In 1912 a much-needed elevator of the most recent and improved design was installed. A new central power plant completed in 1913 consists of a boiler room 42 by 42 feet, with a height of 25 feet, equipped with three modern boilers of 150 horse power each, with sufficient space for the installation of a fourth boiler. There is a smokestack 125 feet high by 5 feet in diameter, a fuel bunker 22 by 43 feet, with a capacity of 300 tons of coal, and a pump room 10 by 36 feet, with modern pumps and duplicates of each, including feed-water heaters. The engine room is equipped with one direct-connected 50 kilowatt generator with proper switch-board and connections for supplying the entire, building with light and power. The new cold storage, ice-making and brine room department is 19 by 34 feet, with a storage battery room of the same dimensions on the second floor. There is also a work-shop in this building. This structure has brick walls, reinforced concrete floor, stair and roof construction, finished floors of vitrified brick, cement and cement tile, the roof finished of slate and slag, and doors and windows of wood.
This plant is manufacturing electricity for lighting and power work, high pressure steam for kitchen and laundry purposes, hot water for the entire building, and brine for cold storage rooms and ice-making, in addition to heating the entire institution, including laundry and rooms for employees detached from the building proper. In order to properly connect this power house with the institution it was found necessary to construct three tunnels, each 6 feet wide by 8 feet high, one of which is 50 feet, another 60 feet, and a third 200 feet long. These tunnels, in addition to their convenience for passage to and fro, carry the pipes for hot water supplies, high pressure steam supplies and returns, brine supplies, electric lines and heating mains and returns. The tops of the tunnels are covered with concrete slabs, reinforced, forming a pavement for outside travel in good weather.
The laundry building was also completely remodeled, the floor of the wash-room proper being built of reinforced concrete. The laundry has been equipped with three direct-connected washing machines, two direct-connected extractors, one starch cooker, one dry room tumbler, one continuous rapid dry room, one large mangle and 12 electric irons and boards, all of the latest and most modern types.
The patient population at Mt. Hope Retreat on October 31, 1913, was: males, 264; females, 397; total, 661.[1]
In 1926, the hospital was housing 634 patients, both male and female, and was being financed through a combination of funds from the city, counties, state and private patients.  Upon reaching its centennial in 1940, the hospital was still clearly proud of its mission and accomplishments.  Following World War II, populations in Mental Health facilities swelled, causing overcrowding conditions that were the subject of a brutal expose by the Sunpapers.  Despite the poor marks given to several State-operated facilities such as Spring Grove State Hospital and Crownsville State Hospital, no mention was made of the Mt. Hope facilities, leaving one to assume that the administrators there were better able to handle the challenges of this tough period.
In 1946, the Mt. Hope Retreat would be renamed as the Seton Institute in honor of Mother Seton. With this change, the institution became an active treatment and clinical training center.  However, its future would grow short as a result in changes in policy toward institutionalization.  New drug therapies became available, and community based services would supplant the older approaches to mental health, though the facility was still treating about 300 patients at one time as late as 1969. Faced with the need for a costly major renovation, the Seton Institute would close its doors in June of 1973, with its outpatient services being moved to St. Agnes Hospital, and other operations being phased out.  The land would be auctioned off in parcels, the largest of which would be purchased by the City of Baltimore for its development into a new office park in the early 1980's.  The main building would later be demolished, and most traces of the former facility would vanish behind new grading and roadways, and facilities such as the NAACP and the MTA's Northwest Bus Division.[2]

Maryland,Patapsco Manor Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Patapsco_Manor_Sanitarium,,,1907,Active,Cottage Plan,,Taylor Manor Hospital | Pinel Clinic | Sheppard Pratt at Ellicott City (Current),"Taylor Manor Hospital is built on part of the Thomas and Sophia Gaither farm, which the Gaither's acquired in 1873 and sold to the Howard County Sanitarium Company in 1907. The Gaither farm was 141 acres, but the sanitarium only purchased 55 acres, along with the Gaither house and other outbuildings. Dr. W. Rushmer White, a Canadian, operated the hospital inside the Gaither house. In 1922 a new building known as the annex was built. On the night of 21 November 1923 the old Gaither
house caught fire and the building was completely destroyed. Plans were started immediately for a series of new buildings. ""A"" Building was reportedly built in 1924, designed by architect Walter M. Gieske, of Catonsville.
In 1949 Irving J. Taylor, MD became the Medical Director. In 1954, the hospital was given the family name and became Taylor Manor Hospital. Under Dr. Irving Taylor’s direction, Taylor Manor was the first hospital in the country to use Thorazine, the first neuroleptic, in 1953. He went on to work with each new anti-psychotic, antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication before it came to market in the ‘50s and ‘60s’. His research included therapeutic benefits, side effects and clinical dose equivalences of the new medications. In 1966, Dr. Irving Taylor started the first psychiatric hospital treatment program in Maryland specifically for adolescents. This was followed in the ‘70s by the development of a Dual-Diagnosis Program for emotionally ill substance abusers, called Group 9 and by a specialized Young Adult Treatment Program.
Edith Taylor, Irving’s wife and the Hospital’s Executive Director, helped design and build a new Center Building which was occupied in 1968, expanding the Hospital’s capacity to 176 beds. Edith Taylor received the Artist’s Equity Award for her placement of original artwork throughout the building to promote a sense of beauty, tranquility and a home-like atmosphere. She also developed the Hospital’s turquoise color scheme and its logo. In 1968, the Hospital held its first Annual Symposium. Only two years later a major 3-day symposium entitled “Discoveries in Biological Psychiatry” highlighted the major advances in psychopharmacology with presentations by 18 of the world’s major researchers. The Educational Programs, and the publications that have resulted, have helped to shape the psychiatric education of thousands of professionals throughout the country.
In 2002 the Sheppard Pratt Health System acquired the hospital operation from the Taylors. The land and buildings were retained by the Taylors and most of the buildings were demolished in late 2008-early 2009 for redevelopment of the land.

The buildings are of frame and brick; they are lighted by electricity. The water supply is by the Baltimore County Water Company. There are 72 acres of land in connection with this institution. The number of patients is limited to 45. The detached buildings consist of a physicians' cottage, a farmer's cottage and servants' quarters. The patients are employed in the garden and on the grounds at farm work, etc. In the way of amusements there is croquet, tennis, golf, weekly dances and entertainments, pool, cards, library, etc. There are two medical officers, consisting of a superintendent and resident physician. Nurses are given practical training, but there is no training school. There are associate dining rooms. Cases of drug and alcoholic addiction are admitted as well as nervous and mental cases. The superintendent is Dr. Lewis H. Gundry.[1]
The Gundry Sanitorium (later Gundry Hospital) was acquired by the Glass Hospital, headed by Dr Sheldon Glass, for $3.2 million on February 5, 1988. The newly renamed facility, Gundry-Glass Hospital, became a 29-bed inpatient centre for children aged 4 to 12 who suffered from acute psychiatric problems. On August 17, 1997, Gundry/Glass Hospital closed and laid off 130 employees. It claimed state officials had failed to pay the facility $3.2 million in Medicaid funds. An investor group owned by Sheppard Pratt Health bought Athol with the intention of finding another user.
The investors sold Athol to the New Psalmist Baptist Church in August 2000.  The 7,500-member congregation $1.4 million for the former hospital. Church officials evaluated which of the five buildings on the campus would be suitable for outreach, education or community purposes. At one point, the church considered building a gymnasium for the neighbourhood. The church subsequently sold the mansion to the city of Baltimore in August 2006 when it relocated to the Seton Business Park.  The city acquired Athol as part of the Uplands redevelopment project.
The original building burnt down in September 2021.

Mary acted as the proprietor with her son as the resident physician until 1898 when Mary retired, and her son gained complete ownership. The Home had five buildings, and it prided itself on its modern conveniences, like steam heating and electricity, as well as its many ""attractions to divert the mind"" such as its extensive library, bowling alley, conservatory, and orchard.

Maryland,Riggs Cottage,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Riggs_Cottage,1896,1861,,Active,Pavilion Plan,,CrossRoads Recovery,"The Riggs Cottage Sanitarium was opened in 1896 by Dr. George H. Riggs, who served as the institution’s medical director until he sold the property in 1939.
Riggs Cottage sat on 42 acres in rural Frederick County, Maryland, about an hour’s drive west of Baltimore. The sanitarium was comprised of a main house with fourteen rooms and a west building (men’s ward) consisting of 10 rooms and connected to the main house by a pavilion. The east building was an eight-room cottage connected to the central building by an annex that housed the dining room. Four additional cottages were built in 1896 and housed examination rooms, additional patient rooms, sitting and dining rooms. The main building, west, and east buildings were built in 1861 by Dr. Riggs’s father as housing for families in the area who worked at the nearby slate quarries.
In addition to the main and dormitory buildings, the property included a nurses house, engine house, barn, large ice house, corn house, poultry house, tennis and croquet grounds. Patients were encouraged to spend time outside and often participated in fishing excursions, baseball games, and daily walks. Inside the sanatorium, patients could be found playing pool and parlor games, listening to music and dancing.
Dr. Riggs treated patients suffering from paranoia, melancholia, epilepsy, schizophrenia, “feeble mindedness,” and dementia. More difficult patients were transferred to Springfield State Hospital in Sykesville. Considered to be one of the foremost psychiatrists of his time, his treatments were innovative and advanced. Hydrotherapy was “indispensable,” including methods such as continuous baths and cold wet sheet packs.
In 1939, Dr. Riggs sold Riggs Cottage to Dr. Hosea McAdoo, who continued to operate the sanitarium until it was again sold in 1953 to Dr. Joseph Lerner. In 1969 the sanitarium was closed and converted into a restaurant. In 2013 CrossRoads Freedom Center acquired the buildings and now run a recovery center for men struggling with addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder.",1969,"Ijamsville, MD",,

In 1876 the facility moved to its present location. At the suggestion of Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, Saint Agnes Hospital in 1898 became a sanitarium for patients suffering from mental illness and drug addiction. The treatments offered by Saint Agnes for these illnesses were innovative, and cutting edge in their day – including hydrotherapy, massage, organic and vegetarian menus, and exercise programs created to inspire individual healing.
The Saint Agnes Sanitarium was reorganized in 1906 as a General Hospital with the arrival of Joseph Colt Bloodgood, MD, as Chief of the Medical Staff, a position he occupied until his death in 1935. A pioneering physician, surgeon, and medical researcher, Dr. Bloodgood established the Intern Education Program – the second oldest surgical residency in the United States, predated only by the Halstead Program at the Johns Hopkins Hospital where he was trained. Over the next 30 years, Dr. Bloodgood led Saint Agnes into a new era of clinical expertise as he made great advances in diagnosing and treating cancer and other illnesses.",,"Baltimore, MD",,

The original buildings were designed by the famous architect Calvert Vaux and constructed on what had previously been a 340 acre farm. The cornerstone of the original building was laid in spring of 1862.
Sheppard stipulated that the following conditions were to be imposed for the Asylum: “Courteous treatment and comfort of all patients; that no patient was to be confined below ground; all were to have privacy, sunlight and fresh air; the asylum's purpose was to be curative, combining science and experience for the best possible results; and that only income, not principal would be used to build and operate the asylum.” Because of these financial restrains, the Asylum did not open until 1891, 34 years after Sheppard's death. It also left it with financial uncertainty, putting its long-term future in doubt.
The future of the Asylum was greatly enhanced when in 1893, upon his death, Baltimore merchant Enoch Pratt bequeathed a substantial amount of his fortune to complete the construction and expand the asylum with the stipulation that the name change to The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital.
Today the hospital is one of the leading mental health providers in the United States, being constantly ranked in the top 10 by US News and World Report. It is also in the midst of an expansion and renovation project, moving patient rooms from its twin historic Victorian era buildings to more modern ones.
The original building plan for The Sheppard & Enoch Pratt Hospital was two buildings.  One for females (the Eastern Division) and one for males (the Western Division).  There was a gap between the two Divisions until 1906 when a service building was added to fill in the gap.  Then the Central Building was added between the Divisions in 1970.

Maryland,Eudowood Sanatarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Eudowood_Sanatarium,,1894,1896,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Hospital for Consumptives of Maryland,"Founded in 1894, it opened its doors two years later in a three-story rowhouse on Hoffman Street and Park Avenue and accommodated six patients. Established by a group of female volunteers, it was the first free hospital for the treatment of TB patients in the nation and was also a pioneer in indigent treatment. The severity of tuberculosis was highlighted in a 1908 article in The Baltimore Sun that said, “Every 24 hours, 18 or 20 young men and women are compelled to lay down their lives in sacrifice to the disease.”
The sanitarium quickly outgrew its original home, and by 1899 had moved into a yellow three-story frame mansion on an oak-studded 55-acre lot off East Joppa Road. The mansion had once been the home of the Stansbury family, who had occupied the property since the 1600s. The hospital expanded rapidly and outgrew the old Stansbury mansion, with cottages built on the property in 1902. Through the 1930s, buildings were added, including a residence for nurses, a medical building, and an infants’ ward. Patients at Eudowood were encouraged to keep physically fit by working on a farm on the property.
After World War II, with costs rising, establishment of state TB hospitals and better drug treatment, Eudowood’s days were numbered. Part of the property was sold in 1959. It was developed into Eudowood Plaza, which opened in 1962 and whose commercial tenants included a Montgomery Ward store, F.W. Woolworth store, a Food Fair market, and national clothing and other retail chains. In 1964, the board decided to finally close the hospital, which had dwindled to 70 patients, 46 of whom were children. At its closing, those remaining were sent to Mount Wilson and the old Baltimore City Hospitals. Today, not a trace of the old hospital remains. The site became Towson Marketplace and is now called Towson Place.

The site contains approximately 500 acres. Most of the 30 buildings are within a security fence. The administration building is just inside the fence, with residential cottages along a loop drive farther from the gate. A gymnasium and modular school building are near the center of the campus. The administration building, the Cullen Building, was constructed in 1946. When last occupied by Juvenile Services, it housed offices on the first level, as well as a kitchen and dining facility in a wing that was added in 1955.[1]

There are differing accounts of the size of the village. The 1909 writer says that there were only 3 houses in the village. A 1947 article in The Jeffersonian describes the village as a “short, double-row of 15 or 20 stone, frame, and log houses along the road on both sides of a big stone tavern, with perhaps 100 residents (in its “most flourishing days”).
Most of the men of Helltown were lime burners or worked in a small stone quarry nearby. The Gunpowder Copper Mill (on Harford Road) opened about 1812 and some of the men of the village are believed to have been employed there. A road about two miles in length (the present Notchcliff Road) ran directly from the village to the mill and it is said that a number of mill workers lived along it on small farms.
The Jeffersonian article states that five of the houses were still standing, and one of them was occupied, as late as the 1890s, and that the last of the original structures, a log house, was burned down in 1902. This is contradicted by the Baltimore Union writer who says that in 1909 one house was still standing and occupied. A large sycamore tree, said to be nearly a hundred years old (in 1947) marked the site of one of the houses
In the 1880s, on the death of Dr. David S. Gittings,  John K. Cowen acquired 500 acres of the Gittings tract and established Notch Cliff Stock Farm. John Kissig Cowen was born in Ohio in 1844 and moved to Baltimore in 1872. At that time he was appointed counsel of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. From 1895-1897 he represented Maryland in the House of Representatives. He served as president of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company from 1896 to 1901.
An auction sale advertisement in the May 10, 1896 issue of The Washington Post announces “the greatest sale of the season of highly-bred horses, mares, and colts….will take place the Notch Cliff Stock Farm, lower Long Green Valley, six miles east of Towson and thirteen miles from Baltimore, Md. The country seat of the Hon. John K. Cowen on the Baltimore and Lehigh R.W. Notch Cliff Station on the farm…” At this time he was selling all of his horses “…with the exception of the trotting stallions Notch Cliff and Calabash Jr. and a few brood mares.”
The 1897 catalog of stock describes Notch Cliff as “…the finest limestone land in Baltimore County…located in the midst of a large limestone belt of well watered, rolling land, noted for its great fertility and productive qualities…it is well equipped with large barns and paddocks, with an abundant supply of spring water flowing through each of the paddocks and barns.” Mr. Cowen stated his intention to breed light harness horses and heavier carriage or coach horses “with good manners and speed” and with pedigrees that “compare favorably with a like number from any of our best stock farms.” The farm and stock were in charge of Mr. Richard C. Frances.
Mr. Cowen died in 1904. The property was placed on the market in 1907. An advertisement in the Towson Democrat and General dated April 20, 1907 read “All that tract of land containing 484 acres of land more less known as Notch Cliff Farm will be sold at public auction on Friday May 17, 1907 subject to the right of way of the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad (which bisected the property and had two stations on it—Notch Cliff and Glen Arm). The School Sisters of Notre Dame bought the property in July 1908 for the sum of $24,705.
The School Sisters of Notre Dame were founded in Bavaria. The Order came to the United States in 1847 to teach the thousands of German immigrants in the US. Its headquarters were in Milwaukee all plans for the purchase and buildings had to be approved by Milwaukee.
The handwritten entry in the first chronicle of Villa Maria Sanatorium at Notch Cliff reads “The large farm was bought mainly for raising potatoes, wheat, fodder etc., and for the keeping of the cows that were to supply the Motherhouse and Notre Dame College with milk, while the adjoining ground was deemed an appropriate site for our ‘Home.’” The Home was to be a residence for sick and convalescent sisters. Sisters also came to visit, to make a retreat, or to spend the summer for vacation or to help out.
On the land purchased were two large houses, barns, and sheds. One of the houses near the road and barns became the overseer’s home (now the horse farm, still owned by Glen Meadows). The other house, “at some distance towards Glen Arm,” was a 3-storey manor house with slave quarters, said to be over 100 years old. This house was known as St. Ann’s and used by mission sisters for short stays during vacation time.
Stone for the construction of Villa Maria’s foundation was quarried from the crest of the hill opposite the building site (referred to as Snowbird Valley). The shingled building featured large porches on the infirmary wing and a gothic chapel named “Mary Help of the Sick.” It was dedicated by Cardinal Gibbons on November 17, 1909. The cemetery was consecrated in 1910. SSND still retains ownership of the cemetery and Glen Meadows rings the Joseph bell for funerals. The 500 pound bell was named after St Joseph, patron saint of a happy death. It was rung 3 times a day from 1908 until Villa Maria was closed in 1984.
Prominent local physician, Dr. John S Green of Greenlea, Long Green, was hired as house-physician.
Over the next 20 years, SSND bought a total of 7 parcels of land, making Villa Maria nearly 500 acres in size.
In 1930 the shingled house was replaced by a brick building on the same foundation, with a new wing added at each end. Again, stone was quarried across the valley. Villa Maria had 141 rooms with a basement as long as a football field (1982). There was a Peeling Room where 11,000 pounds of potatoes were stored in the root cellar. There was a laundry room with a 12-foot press for ironing sheets. The physical therapy wing contained a whirlpool bath. There was a bakery where sisters prepared fresh bread and pastries daily. The sisters did all of the cooking for the Home. In the occupational therapy/crafts room, sisters made dolls, stuffed animals, crocheted blankets and baby sets, and embroidery work. These handicrafts were sold in the gift shop at the College of Notre Dame.
Mr. Bayliss and Mr. Goings were two of the farm workers overseen by the sister in charge of the farm. There were apple, peach, and pear orchards. They raised cattle and pigs and crops of beans and corn.  Their products supplied the needs of the sanatorium, the Baltimore Motherhouse, and the College of Notre Dame. Vegetables, fruits, and dairy products were shipped by train to the Motherhouse at Charles Street and Bellona Avenue. The cattle were sold in 1965 and farming finally became unmanageable in 1979, when the sisters began leasing 300 acres of farmland.
In 1981, there were 64 sisters living in the Villa’s 141 rooms and the annual heating bill was more than $100,000. As the sisters’ numbers declined (as with other religious orders) and the expense of running both the Villa and the Motherhouse increased, the Sisters decided to sell Villa Maria. 504 acres and the home were placed on the market for 2.5 million dollars. The sisters moved to Villa Assumpta, the Motherhouse, on November 7-9, 1984.
In 1984 the property was bought for 2.3 million dollars by a group of healthcare executives and physicians from Fallston General Hospital and they opened the Notchcliff Life Care community in 1986. This group filed for bankruptcy in 1988. Presbyterian Homes Incorporated purchased the property in 1993 after taking over the day-to-day operations in 1990.
The property currently comprises 483 acres with all but 15 acres placed in conservation. Sister Maura, who wrote these words in 1963, would likely agree that they still describe the beauty of Notch Cliff.
“The seasons wheel about Villa Maria with God’s touch upon them. Springtime orchards are shell pink and white. Summer light lingers on the meadows; shadows make cool lanes under the trees; berries ripen; rain waters the corn and potato fields, the heavy Maryland tomato plants. Autumn means that the gum tree will be flaming, the maple scarlet, the oaks ruse color. But winter brings whiteness and an almost paradisine beauty to Notch Cliff: there are long sweeps of untouched whiteness; telephone and electric poles carry their burden of snow on the cross-beam; small lakes of whiteness pool each ivy leaf.”[1]",,"Glen Arm, Maryland",,
Maryland,Pine Bluff State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Pine_Bluff_State_Hospital,,,1912,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Pine Bluff Sanatorium  | Pine Bluff Village,"Originally proposed and built under the direction of Dr. George W. Todd as a Tuberculosis Sanitarium, it was one of 4 buildings at ""Pine Bluff"" and was also known as the Gordy Building. Today, the site known as Pine Bluff, has been subdivided into separate properties with this parcel only including the Gordy Building. Of the 4 original buildings, only the Gordy building and the Chief Medical Officers residence, which is on a separate property, remain. The facility was purchased by the State of Maryland in 1925, becoming the second state-owned health facility on the Eastern Shore and continued to operate as a Tuberculous Sanitarium until 1972.
The facility was re-purposed to serve as an annex to Deer's Head Hospital for a few years after its closing as a Sanitarium, however this was short-lived and was again repurposed to house the offices of the Maintenance of Aged in the Community (MAC) and Shore Up's daycare for the elderly. In 1975, Senator Homer White, working with the MAC program, proposed conducting a study to convert the facilities into a residential care center for the elderly. Through negotiations, a plan to create Pine Bluff Village for the Elderly was approved in 1977, however, the new plans did include renovating the Gordy Building. Today the Pine Bluff Village occupies approximately 20 acres and consists of modem, affordable residential apartment structures for the elderly.",1977,"Salisbury, MD",,
Maryland,Relay Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Relay_Sanitarium,,,1878,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Gundry Sanitarium | Gundry Hospital | Conrad Sanitarium,"The Relay Sanitarium is located at Relay, Baltimore County, Md., and was established in 1878, being founded by Dr. Conrad, and taken over and remodeled by the present management at a more recent date. The buildings are of frame and brick; they are lighted by electricity. The water supply is by the Baltimore County Water Company. There are 72 acres of land in connection with this institution. The number of patients is limited to 45. The detached buildings consist of a physicians' cottage, a farmer's cottage and servants' quarters. The patients are employed in the garden and on the grounds at farm work, etc. In the way of amusements there is croquet, tennis, golf, weekly dances and entertainments, pool, cards, library, etc. There are two medical officers, consisting of a superintendent and resident physician. Nurses are given practical training, but there is no training school. There are associate dining rooms. Cases of drug and alcoholic addiction are admitted as well as nervous and mental cases. The superintendent is Dr. Lewis H. Gundry.[1]
The Gundry Sanitorium (later Gundry Hospital) was acquired by the Glass Hospital, headed by Dr Sheldon Glass, for $3.2 million on February 5, 1988. The newly renamed facility, Gundry-Glass Hospital, became a 29-bed inpatient centre for children aged 4 to 12 who suffered from acute psychiatric problems. On August 17, 1997, Gundry/Glass Hospital closed and laid off 130 employees. It claimed state officials had failed to pay the facility $3.2 million in Medicaid funds. An investor group owned by Sheppard Pratt Health bought Athol with the intention of finding another user.
The investors sold Athol to the New Psalmist Baptist Church in August 2000.  The 7,500-member congregation $1.4 million for the former hospital. Church officials evaluated which of the five buildings on the campus would be suitable for outreach, education or community purposes. At one point, the church considered building a gymnasium for the neighbourhood. The church subsequently sold the mansion to the city of Baltimore in August 2006 when it relocated to the Seton Business Park.  The city acquired Athol as part of the Uplands redevelopment project.
The original building burnt down in September 2021.

Sections of the Almshouse burned twice – in both the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries – and were only partially rebuilt.  The Almshouse was also previously used as a Civil Defense fall-out shelter in the midst of the Cold War, and retains its deposit of emergency paraphernalia.
In 1958, Baltimore County officials closed the historic facility, citing costs. Since its closure, the Almshouse has housed the Historical Society of Baltimore County (founded in 1959), and a variety of County government offices and other nonprofits. In 1980, the Almshouse was added to the County Landmarks List. Today, the Historical Society maintains its collections and offices, runs a research center for the public, and holds events in this historic structure.",1958,"Cockeysville, MD",,

Maryland,Carroll County Almshouse and Farm,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Carroll_County_Almshouse_and_Farm,,,"May 23, 1853",Closed and Preserved,Cottage Plan,,Carroll County Farm Museum,"When Carroll County was created by an act of the Maryland General Assembly in 1837, legislation was also passed to make Westminster the County Seat; to build a courthouse, a jail, a register's office, a clerk's office, and a poorhouse (almshouse).
It was the custom in 19th Century America to house the poor in a building called an almshouse since there was no welfare, housing subsidy, or food stamps as we have today. It was not until 1852 that the County Commissioners decided to borrow funds to build the Almshouse. A contract was made on July 6, 1852, for the purchase of 307 acres at a cost of $17,826 or $58.065 per acre. Records indicate that the Almshouse was built in 1852 and 1853. Public notice was given that paupers would be received on May 23, 1853.
In the early years of the Almshouse, also called the ""County Home,"" the chief position was the ""Steward of the Almshouse,"" who was paid $400 yearly. Other workers included a Teamster at $150, a Fireman at $150, a Matron at $75, a Maid at $84, and a Washwoman at $75 yearly.
At times as many as fifty people lived here. The Steward lived on the second floor and the women on the third floor. The men's dormitory sits at a right angle to the house. Residents who were able helped to work the farm to raise food for themselves.
People other than the poor from Carroll County lived here as well. It was a favorite stop for hobos and tramps. Sometimes the insane or criminals were placed here. Windows were barred in some rooms, and doors were lined with sheets of metal.
During the Civil War, Westminster served as a point of entry and a service center for Gettysburg. At different times during the week of June 28 to July 4, 1863, both Confederate and Union troops, with their wagons and mules, camped on Almshouse grounds on their way to the Battle of Gettysburg.
In 1965 the Almshouse closed its doors to the poor forever. It had outlived its usefulness, being replaced by new government programs assisting low income families. Fortunately, a far-sighted County Extension Agent had another idea for the property. With the devoted expertise of a County Administrative Assistant, the Carroll County Farm Museum was born.[1]

Maryland,Cecil County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Cecil_County_Almshouse,,,1887,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Cecil County Insane Asylum,"In 1788, Cecil County purchased about 174 acres of land a few miles north of Elkton.  Within a few years, a home for the unfortunate was built.  An annual report from 1855 provides some details on the operation of the almshouse.  Seventy-one inmates lived there, many of them aiding in work on the county farm.[1]
In 1887, the Cecil County Insane Asylum opened on the grounds of the County Almshouse (present-day Mt. Aviat Academy in Childs). When it opened, thirteen patients who’d been scattered in institutions around the state were brought back to their modern home in Cecil County. Prior to that time, the mentally ill from Cecil ended up in the county jail or poorhouse, or they were institutionalized at other insane asylums in Baltimore.[2]
Gradually, the state assumed responsibility for providing inpatient mental health and then in May 1915, after the Eastern Shore Hospital in Cambridge opened, 26 patients were taken for that long ride to Dorchester County. A few months earlier, nine African-American residents had been transferred to the state hospital for the colored insane at Crownsville. The asylum was torn down in 1935, when C. B. Van den Huevel was paid $50.25 to remove the structure. [3]
The actual poorhouse continued operating for several more decades.  But in 1952, the county farm and almshouse went on the auction block.  The land was purchased by Daniel Bathon and he donated the property to the O[blate Sisters of St. Francis de Sales. The order operates a private Catholic School, Mt. Aviat Academy.  The order uses the main poorhouse building as its convent.
The County Potter's Field, the final resting place for paupers, was located across the road from the poorhouse.  At this cemetery, there are some 150 to 200 unmarked graves.[4]",,"Childs, MD",,
Maryland,Montevue Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Montevue_Asylum,,,1832/1870,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Frederick County Almshouse | Montevue Home,"In 1870, the Montevue Asylum was built to care for the mentally ill and homeless and included a hospital. A Tramp House was located behind it where as many as 600 people per month were housed, many transients. That building in 1934 was renovated to create the Emergency Hospital, and 20 years later it became the Frederick County Chronic Hospital accommodating 22 patients. In 1959, the facility was renamed Montevue Home to house the aged and indigent.
In 1884 the state health department lauded the asylum as a model institution which brought credit upon the county. Early Lunacy Commission annual reports also praised the conditions at Montevue as being exemplary. Yet by the mid-1890s, even a Frederick County grand jury suggested that the conditions could be improved for some of its patients. Reflecting the segregationist thought that often pervaded Progressive thinking it noted: ""The enlargement of an adjoining building for the confinement and care of the Colored portion of inmates would in our opinion be of great advantage to the institution."" Montevue accepted, along with payment from other counties, insane African Americans from throughout Maryland. Chronic overcrowding of black patients at this institution had been noted within the commission's annual report since 1895. It appears that a string of county commissioners viewed Montevue as the means to build up county coffers. Only the Frederick County commissioners steadfastly refused to endorse the concept of state care.
The Montevue photographs contained in the 23rd Annual Report of the Maryland Lunacy Commission built the strongest case for abolishing the system of county care. Commission members had made five visits to Montevue in the space of several months, the most of any such institution, carefully seeking out the most incriminating images. A series of photographs produced in January of 1909, taken with flash equipment, came as a result of a surprise night time inspection by Dr. Arthur Herring, Commission Secretary.[1]
By 1930, the purpose of Montevue Hospital shifted. In 1913, the problem of the overcrowded hospital was partially relieved with the opening of the Springfield State Hospital and the Crownsville State Hospital. The insane residents were sent to both facilities: the white residents were taken to Springfield and the African-American residents were taken to Crownsville). The New Deal era saw a number of laws passed concerning government social services, with work agencies and short-time prison sentences reducing the number of vagrants. Social agencies and institutions reduced the number of children staying at the almshouse. A new law set a maximum ninety days for a child staying at the almshouse. Relief agencies, pension plans, or private hospitals took care of the ""respectable aged poor"". Montevue Hospital continued to provide shelter for transients, the elderly poor, and those in need of medical care, especially African-Americans.
Montevue's farm and the medical facilities were de-emphasized in the latter half of the twentieth century. During the early 1960s, Frederick County changed the roles of many of the outbuildings and began constructing non-almshouse-related buildings on the property. For example, the old Bake House/Meat House was rehabilitated into the County's animal testing laboratory. By 1984, the almshouse had stopped consuming food from the farm, though local fanners continued to rent the land. During the 1980s, the Frederick County Commissioners estimated that the cost of a new building would be less than maintenance of the old almshouse. The commissioners voted to construct a new home north of the old institution on former almshouse farmland. In 1987, the Montevue Hospital building (1870) was demolished and the residents moved to the new Montevue Home. Since that time, the County has continued to build a number of new government-related buildings on the former Montevue property.
The name Montevue is continued with a Frederick County owned assisted living facility, the current building constructed in 1987.[2]

Maryland,Washington County Almshouse,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Washington_County_Almshouse,1830,,1831,Demolished,Single Building,,Washington County Poor House | Washington County Old Men's Home,"The Pennsylvania State Legislature, passed an act of April 6, 1830, giving authority to Washington County to erect a building and conduct an institution for the employment and support of the poor of Washington County. The first Washington County Commissioners purchased land situated in Chartiers and North Strabane Townships from Robert Colmery on August 19, 1830. The property comprised 172 acres and the purchase price was $2,752.00. The site is adjacent to the Chartiers Valley Railroad and the former Washington and Cononsburg Electric Railway Line, 1/4 mile east of the former Arden Station. In 1865 six additional acres were purchased and in 1867 another twenty-eight acres were added to the property. The first building was erected in 1831 and was replaced when the present main building was commenced in 1872 and completed in 1874. The institution was known as the Washington County Home for the Poor from 1831 to 1883, when separate institutions were built for women and children. Since 1883, families were no longer housed at this facility, and it became known as the Washington County Old Men's Home. The main building is an example of institutional type architecture built in the Second Empire style of architecture. [1]

This building was re-purposed and expanded for use as the Baltimore City and County Almshouse from 1820 through 1866. The Hebrew Orphan Asylum was established in 1872 and operated in the Calverton mansion until displaced by a fire in 1874. After some deliberation, the leaders of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum decided to rebuild at the same location following a design by architects Lupus & Roby.
The Hebrew Orphan Asylum moved to a new facility in 1923 and the building transitioned to serve as the West Baltimore General Hospital from 1923 through 1945. The facility then became the Lutheran Hospital of Maryland and remained in use from 1945 to 1989. The history of the building as a hospital included the addition of several related structures to the campus only one of which, a 1945 maternity ward, remaining extant. This building, designed by Henry Powell Hopkins and built by the John K. Ruff Company, now operates as the Tuerk House, a residential drug and alcohol rehab facility. The original Hebrew Orphan Asylum building has been vacant since 1989 and has been owned by Coppin State University since 2003.
Baltimore Heritage, a nonprofit historic preservation advocacy organization, nominated the Hebrew Orphan Asylum to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 with support from Coppin State University.
The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 2010. The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of November 5, 2010.",1989,Baltimore Maryland,Victorian Romanesque,
