Virginia,Catawba Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Catawba_Hospital,,,1908 (state owned),Active,Cottage Plan,,Catawba Hospital,"The land on which Catawba Hospital stands has a history of healing dating back to 1857. That was the year several businessmen from Salem, VA discovered the potential of sulphur and limestone springs on Catawba mountain.  In June of 1858, they opened Roanoke Red Sulphur Springs Resort.  The 700 acre resort extended up the mountain from the Catawba Valley.  It lies ten miles north of Salem on the northern border of Roanoke County, VA.  Joe Chapman later bought the Roanoke Red Sulphur Springs resort.
Chapman catered to people who wanted to escape to the mountains for the good, clean, healthful air and the peace and quiet that this remote resort offered. Chapman advertised his water as being valuable in the treatment of lung diseases.  He shipped the spring water around the country and dubbed it, ""Catawba Iron or All Healing"". At the height of its popularity, the main hotel accommodated 300 guests. Residents of Roanoke were repeat guests at the resorts which  continued to operate until 1908.
By the early 1900s, the resort attracted many tuberculosis victims. In 1908, the Commonwealth of Virginia purchased the property from the Chapman family.  The Commonwealth appropriated $40,000 to establish the first Tuberculosis Sanatorium. Initially wooden pavilions housed TB patients.  Patients in 1909 were treated to fresh air (cold or hot), plenty of sunshine, rest and as much food as they could handle. These were the only known treatments for Tuberculosis until the advent of thoracic surgery around 1920. Tuberculosis was eventually brought under control with the invention of Streptomycin and Isonicotinic Hydrazide (INH) in the late 1940s and 1950s.
In 1972, Catawba Hospital became part of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (in 2009, renamed to Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services) as a treatment and rehabilitation center for the psychiatric needs of geriatric patients.  In 1981, a unit for acute, short-term psychiatric treatment of patients ages 18-64 was opened.  In 1985, Catawba Hospital received accreditation from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  Part of the Commonwealth of Virginia public behavioral health system, Catawba Hospital specializes in serving adults including geriatric individuals who are in need of mental health care.",,"Catawba, VA",,
Virginia,Central Lunatic Asylum,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_Lunatic_Asylum,1882,1885,1885,Active,Kirkbride Plan(Demolished)/ Cottage Plan,,Central Lunatic Asylum for Colored Insane | Central State Hospital (Current),"The origin of Central State Hospital dates back to the close of the Civil War when in April 1865, Congress created the Freedman's Bureau to establish hospitals, schools and other facilities for the African-American population.
In December 1869, a former Confederate Facility, known as Howard's Grove Hospital, was designated as a mental health hospital for African-Americans. The name was later changed to Central Lunatic Asylum. In June 1870, the General Assembly passed an act incorporating the Central Lunatic Asylum as an organized state institution. When the Commonwealth of Virginia assumed ownership, there were ""123 insane persons and 100 paupers, not insane"" housed at the asylum. Many patients arrived at Howard's Grove by way of civil commitments made by local judges at the request of friends and family. Other patients were removed from local jails and criminally committed. The asylum was overseen by a superintendent who answered to the Court of Directors. As with other state institutions, physicians, nurses and matrons were employed to care for patients. The buildings at Howard's Grove during the period of 1870 to 1885 were described as being of plain, if not crude, wood construction. They were divided into sections according to the patient's particular ailment or behavior. Residents were fed in their cells, as no dining facility existed at that time. There was no sewage system, and light was supplied by kerosene lamps and candles.
In 1882, the Mayfield Farm in Dinwiddie County was purchased by the City of Petersburg for $15,000 and presented to the Commonwealth for the development of a new mental health hospital. The first patients (a total of 373) were transferred to the present site of the hospital on March 22, 1885. Ten years later, the population had doubled and by the end of 1950, there were 4,043 inpatients with 691 on parole or escape status. Construction of the new facility near Petersburg was completed in early spring 1885. Additional tracts of land were purchased and new buildings were constructed regularly thereafter, as the number of patients increased. The new construction later included a special building to house the criminally insane apart from the rest of the hospital population. This section of the campus would later be referred to as the Forensic Mental Health Unit. An early institutional history notes that treatment at Central Lunatic Asylum during the 1890s was humane and emphasized the value of work and the benefits of recreation. However, practices at the facility also included seclusion, mechanical restraints, and the administering of hypnotics.
By 1894, Central Lunatic Asylum was officially renamed Central State Hospital. This piece of legislation also altered the names of the other mental health facilities in Virginia in and attempt to inspire a more positive image of the institutions, and of mental health treatment in general. It is important to note that another state institution located in Staunton, Virginia went by the name Central Lunatic Asylum between the years of 1861 and 1865. Its name was later changed to Western Lunatic Asylum, and is a separate facility with no connection to the Richmond/Petersburg hospital for African Americans.
During the 1950's, a Maximum Security Forensic Unit was built for the evaluation and treatment of patients referred by the courts. Within a few years, the average inpatient population had reached 4,800 and overcrowding in the old unsafe ward buildings had become a major problem. A geriatric treatment center was also erected for the care of the chronically ill and bedridden. This was the first in a series of five treatment buildings constructed specifically for geriatric services. With the improvement in community services, the Barrow Geriatric Center was closed in the summer of 1985.
The years between 1962 and 1968 brought many changes to CSH. Hospital services and facilities were upgraded and four adult treatment buildings were erected. The early sixties also saw the beginning of treatment for adolescents and the first alcohol abuse treatment program. From its founding until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Central State Hospital served and treated only African-American Mentally Ill, Mentally Retarded, Geriatric, and Criminally Insane from the entire state of Virginia. In 1967 the Hospital opened its doors to accept patients regardless of race or national origin and only from the Central Virginia area.
In 1971, Mentally Retarded patients at Central State Hospital were transferred to a new and separate facility constructed on the campus specifically for the the treatment of the Mentally Retarded. Central State Hospital still operates as a state-run institution in the same general location as it did in 1885. Though its clientele, medical practices, and appearance have changed over time, the mission of Central State Hospital remains much the same: ""to provide state of the art mental health care and treatment to forensic and civilly committed patients"" in central Virginia. Southside Virginia Training Center continues to treat nearly 600 severely and profoundly retarded patients.

Virginia,Eastern State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Eastern_State_Hospital,1771,1773/1935(Current location),,Active,Pre-1854 Plans (Original)Cottage Plan,,Public Hospital For Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds | Eastern Lunatic Asylum,"In 1771, contractor Benjamin Powell was appointed to began construction on the public hospital. The public hospital was a two-story brick building south of Francis Street. A fire in 1885 destroyed the original 1773 hospital building, which included a central hall leading to the keeper's quarters and the patient cells. A central staircase led to the room in which the court of directors held their meetings, as well as to more patient accommodations. Before he was finished, Powell was also directed to add outdoor ""yards for patients to walk and take the Air in"" and to ""put a fence around the lot."" The first patient was admitted to the public hospital on October 12th, 1773. The hospital's maximum capacity was 24 patients, a number that was not reached until the early 1800s.
The public hospital showed aspects of both jail and infirmary in its design, expressing the increasing fear of social deviants occurring at that time. There were three people originally staffing the public hospital: a keeper, a matron (for female patients), a physician, and a few slaves to care for the daily upkeep of the hospital and its patients. The keeper of the hospital was James Galt, and his wife was the hospital matron.
In 1841, the name of the public hospital was changed from The Public Hospital For Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds to Eastern Lunatic Asylum, carrying with it the connotations of a sanctuary for the mentally ill. Also in that year, a third story was added onto the main building. The gaol-like positions of superintendent and matron were replaced with the position of superintendent. The superintendent was a resident, full-time doctor and head administrator to the hospital. The superintendent in 1841 was John Minson Galt II, who made sweeping changes in the management and care of patients. At his death in May of 1862, the hospital housed between 200 and 300 patients in its 7 buildings.
In the 1850s, Superintendent Galt suggested a day-patient approach similar to the town of Geel (present-day Germany), where patients went into town and interacted with the community during the day and returned to the hospital at night to sleep. The Court of Directors rejected this proposal. The idea was a century ahead of its time and re-emerged as de-institutionalization in the 1900s. However, Dr. Galt did carry out an experiment with de-institutionalization in Williamsburg that lasted for a decade. Convalescing patients who behaved well and had good self-control (approximately half of the 280 patients at the time), had the freedom of the town at all times during the day. The townspeople were also encouraged to visit and socialize with patients still confined to the hospital grounds. Many of these changes were a part of a new era called ""moral management,"" brought about due to a change in social perception of mental illness.
Many changes to Eastern State Asylum occurred at this time. The asylum, as well as the surrounding area, was captured by Union troops on May 6th of 1862. John Minson Galt II, superintendent for 21 years, also died that month. With the capture of the city, all but one of the white attendants had fled. The 252 patients had been left, locked in their apartments to starve. The remaining attendant, Sommersett Moore, handed the keys to the hospital to the Union army and saved the lives of the patients.
A great many changes occurred during the next 23 years, to both the administration of the hospital, and to the size of its population. Superintendents did not always have the full support of their staff or the Court of Directors, and the hospital did not always receive adequate financial support. In 1876, fire destroyed one of the asylum buildings. One superintendent, Dr. Harvey Black, was inspired by Dr. Galt's manuscripts to try and deinstitutionalize some of the 400+ patients at the hospital in the late 1880s. He was fired by the court of Directors and replaced by Dr. Richard Wise, whose goal was to find space within Eastern State Asylum for as many ""unfortunates"" as possible. Under his supervision, the population of the hospital rose from 323 to 447 patients. At this time, there were 10 buildings on the Eastern State Asylum property. A few of the therapeutic activities introduce by Galt still continued, but for the most part the hospital became a long-term care facility for the chronically ill.
After the Civil War, there was an increasing lack of confidence in the ability of science to cure mental illness. Though mental illness was believed to be hereditary or of physical nature, the problem of its cure defied scientific solution. The hospital became crowded with the chronically mentally ill, and the number of patients successfully cured declined. Admission to the hospital was on a first-come, first-serve basis, regardless of chances for successful treatment. During the era of custodial care, the goal became not to cure mental illness, but to provide a comfortable environment for the mentally ill, separate from society. Recreational activities such as dances, steamboat excursions, and tea parties were offered to patients, as well as magic lanterns, a stereopticon viewer, and checkerboards. The use of restraints, in the forms of straight-jackets and Utica cribs (mesh boxes to confine the violent and unruly), were also reintroduced during this time.
On June 7th in 1885 on a Sunday evening, a fire destroyed the original 1773 hospital building. The nearest fire engine at the time was in Richmond, some 50 miles away. Students from the nearby College of William and Mary came to the assistance of the hospital staff to help put out the fire. By the time the fire was out, five other buildings in the asylum complex had burned down. The fire left two patients missing (presumed dead) and 224 other patients displaced. Electrical wiring for lighting, one of the improvements made to Eastern State Asylum during the superintendence of James D. Moncure, was suspected of sparking the blaze.
In 1894 the hospital was renamed from Eastern Lunatic Asylum to Eastern State Hospital. By 1935 Eastern State Hospital housed some 2000 patients with no more land for expansion. The restoration of Colonial Williamsburg and the Williamsburg Inn surrounded the facility with a thriving tourist trade. A proposal was made to move the hospital to Dunbar Farms, located west of the city on Ironbound Road. The first care buildings at Dunbar were constructed and inhabited in 1937. The Dunbar Farm land is where Eastern State Hospital stands to this day.
Treatment of patients also changed during this time, as effective psychiatric drugs for the treatment of mental illness became available after World War II. The idea of community-based care, a version of which was proposed by Dr. Galt a century prior, was carried out in the 1960s under the name of deinstitutionalization.

When the move from Francis Street to Dunbar Farms was completed in 1960, the old asylum complex was razed. In 1972 the original public hospital building was excavated. The debris from the 1885 fire had merely been shoveled into the remaining foundations, and various small items such as glass were recovered. In 1979, Colonial Williamsburg received approval to reconstruct the old hospital building, which was opened to the public in June of 1985. Today, the reconstructed building houses a public hospital exhibit, staff offices, and serves as an entrance to the DeWitt? Wallace Decorative Arts Museum.[1]

The Eastern State Hospital Cemetery is but a short distance from the original Hospital location. Patients who died were buried here, but all were laid to rest on unmarked graves, thus the cemetery for the most part is just a piece of well kept land. It has wrought fence on the front of the cemetery, and immediately upon entering the gate there is a monument area that was erected in 1986, consisting of five granite stones with the theme ""CELEBRATING THEIR DIGNITY"".
The following words are inscribed in one of them:""We erect this monument in memory of those persons whom we have known, loved and served through the years. While living they knew the suffering of inner pain, confusion and despair. Now they are at peace in the hands of God where no torment will ever touch them again"".
On the other four stones, the names of all laid to rest are inscribed, over 1,200. They are not alphabetized nor does it show any dates. There are only about half a dozen old stone markers in the cemetery, and on the last few years, simple stones with names and dates are noted by the fence area.",,,,

Virginia,Southwestern State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Southwestern_State_Hospital,1884,,1887,Active,Cottage Plan,Harry and Kenneth McDonald,Southwestern Lunatic Asylum | Southwestern Virginia Mental Health Institute,"In March 1884 the Virginia General Assembly appointed a board of commissioners to select a site for a new lunatic asylum for white citizens to be built west of New River. The board selected a 208-acre site in Smyth County and in August 1884 the General Assembly gave the board the power to purchase the land for thirty thousand dollars and granted the county the right to issue bonds as well. In November 1884 the General Assembly formally established the Southwestern Lunatic Asylum, near Marion, Virginia. Dr. Harvey Black, J. Hoge Tyler, Thomas J. Boyd, D.D. Hull, Dr. John S. Apperson, N.L. Look and F.B. Hurt were appointed to the building committee which was tasked with overseeing the construction of the hospital.
An article in The Conservative Democrat of Richmond, Virginia, dated February 3, 1887, stated that the
Southwestern Lunatic Asylum, as it was then named,was considered “the most modernized and convenient institution, as well as the most economical in cost that
had been built.” When it opened, the building could accommodate 280 patients, but it was expected that 800 patients would be housed when the wings were
expanded at a future date. The original building included six patient wards that were attached to the rear (south) of the current Henderson Building; Wards
A, B and C were for women, and Wards 1, 2 and 3 were for men. An additional ward called Ward D was located on the third floor of the Central Building. The building
also housed a kitchen, laundry, bakery, two dining rooms (one for men and one for women), a sewing room, elevator, and patient and attendants’ rooms.
Dr. Harvey Black became the first superintendent of Southwestern Lunatic Asylum when it opened in May 1887. Dr. Robert J. Preston and Dr. John S. Apperson served as assistant physicians, and Mr. C.W. White was appointed as steward to oversee the day-to-day business operations of the hospital. The hospital received its first two patients on May 17, 1887, both of whom were from Washington County, Virginia. Adam Surratt, a 27-year-old laborer, died on June 17, 1903 with a diagnosis of
“abscess of the brain” and is buried on the grounds of Southwestern Virginia Mental Health Institute. The second patient was Elizabeth Barker, a 53-year-old woman who was discharged on September 30,1890 as “recovered.” The patient population grew steadily and over time several buildings were added to the hospital's campus including a tuberculosis treatment building, a building for the criminally insane, the Davis Clinic, and the Harmon Building. For much of its early history, the hospital was mostly self-sufficient through the utilization of its own farm for meat, milk, and vegetables. Other early hospital superintendents include Dr. Robert J. Preston (1888-1906), Dr. Daniel Trigg (1906-1908), Dr. J.C. King (1908-1915), Dr. E.H. Henderson (1915-1927), and Dr. George A. Wright (1927-1937).
Eight acres of land was bought that bordered the front lawn and was within 300 feet of the main building in 1910. Three dwelling houses,each containing seven rooms, were built near the hospital to be rented to employees. A complete brick plant with the capacity for 25,000 bricks per day was also built in preparation for building the new Criminal Insane Building. It was anticipated the new building would accommodate 100 to 125 individuals and work was begun on this building in early July 1910. The transfer of 30 epileptics to the Virginia State Epileptic Colony in 1911 gave temporary relief of the overcrowded conditions in the male department; their places, however, were quickly filled with new admissions. The Criminal Insane Building was completed and received its first patients on January 6,1913.
A new Power Plant was built in 1923, along with a tunnel 7 x 5 feet and 556 feet long extending from the
power plant to the main hospital building. This tunnel carried all the steam, hot water, electric and
telephone lines. A brick garage was also built at that time that could accommodate 14 cars. It was
steam heated and the spaces were rented to employees at a nominal fee.
The old Power Plant and kitchen were subsequently torn down and a new wing, four stories high, was
added to the extreme southern end of the main building. This addition
contained bed space for 150 patients on Wards D and L, along with a new
kitchen, sewing room, laundry, storeroom, refrigeration plant, bakery,
employee’s dining room, and dumbwaiters to each patient floor, and was
ready for occupancy on June 15, 1927. The attic of this new addition was
built to provide attractive, comfortable living quarters for nurses and
attendants. Following these renovations the building was named after Dr. E. H. Henderson, who served
as Superintendent from November 10, 1915 until his death on February 25, 1927.
By 1931, the average census for patients actually in the hospital was 988.03 and the facility employed a
total of 166 employees. A front porch was built extending across the entire width of the Henderson
Building of the colonial type of architecture, two stories high. The old clock tower was removed as it
was considered too dangerous; however, the dome over the rotunda situated directly behind the old
tower was left intact. A paved driveway from the Henderson Building was constructed from the
intersection of the main hospital entrance with Main Street, and concrete curbing was laid. A sunken
garden was added to the grounds with a water pool and stocked with rainbow trout. A sun porch and
additional bathroom was constructed and installed in the home occupied by the superintendent, and a
10-stall garage was also built to store the fire hose and accessory equipment. A Craft Shop was
established at the facility and it was determined there was a need for the establishment of a
standardized occupational therapy department for the entire institution.
One of the hospital's most influential superintendents, Dr. Joseph R. Blalock, served from 1938 to 1971 and was the force behind many changes in treatment including the use of psycho-surgery, drug therapy, and vocational rehabilitation. On July 26, 1951, 12 patients underwent the first operations of prefrontal lobotomy. This new
procedure had necessitated the purchase of additional surgical instruments so that the facilities for brain surgery, as well as other types of surgery, were greatly improved. The first trans-orbital lobotomies were performed in 1953, with a total of 26 being performed that year. The cases for transorbital lobotomy were very carefully selected based on the following criteria: duration of mental illness for at least two years, a trial of other therapies, and the approval of the staff and the Commission of the Department of Mental Hygiene and Hospitals. Fortunately, this practice was soon discontinued. Serpasil and Thorazine were also tried on an experimental basis that year.
A survey on April 3, 1961, showed that 26.5% of the hospital’s patients were 65 years or older.
Providing for an increasing geriatric population led to approval for remodeling the old Criminal Insane
Building (“C” Building) after the “criminally insane” patients were relocated to the Finley Gayle Building.
This remodeling project was completed in March, 1961, at a cost of $158,308.72. The building
contained four wards with a total bed capacity of 152 patients on the first and second floors, an elevator
and adequate provision for food service. At this time the building was designated the Geriatric Building.
The completion of this building gave the opportunity to vacate the Davis Clinic Building, which was
eventually torn down to provide room for additional parking space.[1]
By the mid-1970s, deinstitutionalization had greatly diminished the patient population as mental health treatment became more community-focused. In 1981, the Virginia Department of Corrections took over the care and treatment of adjudicated criminally insane patients at the hospital. This institution is adjacent to the hospital and is known as the Marion Correctional Treatment Center. In 1986, the General Assembly passed legislation providing for the demolition and reconstruction of much of Southwestern State Hospital. The new Bagley Building was constructed to house 177 patients in an integrated care design with living and treatment areas in one place. All adult patients were moved to the new complex in March 1990.
The hospital has gone through two name changes in its history. In 1935 the General Assembly passed legislation changing the name from Southwestern Lunatic Asylum to Southwestern State Hospital. In 1988, the name was changed to Southwestern Virginia Mental Health Institute.

The original hospital cemetery was located directly in the proposed path of the new interstate being
built through Southwest Virginia necessitating the Virginia Department of Transportation to relocate the
cemetery to its present site in 1961 so that construction of Interstate 81 could commence across the
property. The current cemetery sits on a hill above the hospital and is a place of panoramic views and
quiet solitude. Graves in the cemetery date back to the late 1880’s when the hospital was opened. The
cemetery also contains the graves of several confederate veterans from the Civil War. Very few patients
have been buried in the cemetery in recent years, but there are presently approximately 1,210 grave
sites located at the cemetery. The identity and location of each person buried in the cemetery is known and has
been plotted on a grid. Anyone wishing to visit the cemetery should contact the hospital to arrange a
date and time to visit as all visitors must be escorted to the cemetery.",,"Marion, VA",,"1,583 in 1968"

Virginia,Western State Hospital,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Western_State_Hospital,1825,1826,1828,Preserved(Original)Active,Pre-1854 Plans,,Western State Lunatic Asylum,"Western State Hospital was founded in January 1825 by an Act of the General Assembly becoming the second mental health facility for the Commonwealth of Virginia. A Court of Directors was commissioned by the Governor to select and purchase ""a site near the town of Staunton in Augusta County to the West of the Blue Ridge Mountains and to thereupon construct an appropriate asylum for the receipt of patients.""
The original building (which is still standing and registered as a National Historical Landmark) was opened on July 24, 1828, with Mr. Samuel Woodward designated as Keeper, and his wife, Mary Woodward assigned as Matron. A visiting physician, Dr. William Boyes of Staunton, provided care for patients admitted during the early years of the hospital.
The first patient was admitted the morning of July 24, 1828. He was a teacher whose diagnosis was ""hard study."" A second patient was admitted that afternoon from Goochland County, Virginia, but remained only a few months at the facility before he escaped. The first woman arrived on July 25, and was admitted with a diagnosis of ""Religious Excitement.""
Shortly after the facility opened, it was filled with patients and the Court of Directors implemented an admissions screening process to limit admissions to only those patients ""who were either dangerous to society from their violence, or those who were offensive to its moral sense by their indecency and to those cases of derangement where there is reasonable ground to hope that the afflicted may be restored.""
The first director of the hospital, Dr. Francis T. Stribling, was appointed in 1840. He served the hospital until his death in 1874. Dr. Stribling embraced the concept of ""Moral Therapy"" and was one of the thirteen founders of the American Psychiatric Association. In 1905, a physician who began working at Western State in 1889 as a medical intern was appointed Director of the facility. Dr. Joseph DeJarnette served as Director from 1905 until 1943, 38 years, which represents the longest tenure of any of the sixteen facility directors serving the facility since its opening.
The facility’s name was changed in 1894 from Western Lunatic Asylum to Western State Hospital. The facility continued to increase in size through the 1950’s and 1960’s with the opening of a second site in 1949-1950. The facility’s patient population eventually increased to above 3,000 at two sites.
Western State was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 25, 1969. In the 1970s, the Virginia Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation built a new hospital a few miles to the East and abandoned the historic old site. The property was subsequently transferred to the Virginia Department of Corrections and the campus became the Staunton Correctional Center, a medium security prison. The Department of Corrections abandoned the complex in 2003. It is currently in the first stages of redevelopment: condos, hotel/spa and shops.
Beginning with the Commonwealth’s move toward de-institutionalization in the early 1970’s, the population declined substantially until, by the late 1970’s, it stood at approximately 1,350. Further reductions were realized over the last fifteen years as hospital programs were related to sister facilities and the communities. A more restrictive criteria for admissions and improved prescreening programs have also been implemented. Substantial improvements in psychopharmacology and community treatment modalities along with earlier intervention have also contributed to reduced census.
In 1978 the University of Virginia (UVA) expanded its affiliation with the hospital providing for joint faculty appointments and the assignment of psychiatric residents and medical students to the facility for training. This program continued to expand with particular highlights in 1985 with the appointment of Dr. Spradlin as the Facility Director at Western State. In 1990, the hospital received the first National Award from the American Psychiatric Association as the exemplary program in Collaborative Services between a public mental health facility and a university.
Western State Hospital has extensive affiliations with colleges and universities involved in all of the major professional groups including. Various staff at Western State Hospital had joint faculty appointments with a number of institutions of higher education; staff with the Department of Psychiatric Medicine interdigitate with hospital programs for the provision of services and educational supervision.[1]

Virginia,St. Albans Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=St._Albans_Sanitarium,1892,,1916 (mental health facility),Preserved,Single Building,,St Albans Lutheran Boys School,"With $500 of his own money, Dr. John C. King, formed a corporation and with $16,000 in borrowed funds he acquired the Saint Albans buildings along with 56 acres of land. The buildings were thoroughly renovated and, on January 15, 1916, the first four patients were admitted.
In the tradition of other treatment facilities of the time, St. Albans Sanatorium included a farm which, according to an old brochure, “[…] affords ample space for out-of-door games, diversional exercises and employment, also vegetable and flower gardens, an adequate dairy herd and extensive poultry-raising, all of which are interesting and helpful to the patients.”
St. Albans Sanatorium struggled initially with financial problems. However, Dr. King and his wife kept the hospital open and gradually expanded its services and reputation. The building of the Radford Arsenal and the rapid population growth associated with it had a profound impact on St. Albans. Patient numbers rose and, since it was the only hospital in the community at the time, it also provided general medical care.
To accommodate all these patients, the staff worked six days a week while living in quarters provided by the hospital. By 1945, the total number of patients treated during its first 29 years was 6509 and its staff numbered 48. The hospital continued to grow in the following decades. St. Albans became a fully recognized hospital in 1960, and started opening outpatient clinics in Roanoke, Blacksburg, and Beckley, WV.  In 1980, in order to stay up-to-date with advancing technology, parts of St. Albans were relocated into a more modern $8 million facility. In the late 1980s, the institution on the New River was the Commonwealth’s only private, full service, not-for-profit psychiatric hospital. It was a source of pride for many people living in Radford and Pulaski County.
The glory days of the old St. Albans were, however, almost over. In the 1990s, the hospital became part of the Carilion Health System, which moved ahead with plans to relocate it to another site, eventually building the “New River Medical Center” at its current location off of Interstate 81. The old buildings and the surrounding 78 acres became a gift from Carilion to the Radford University Foundation in 2004. The demolition of the 1890s structure was halted in December 2007, and a group of concerned citizens from around the New River Valley was about to begin a proper historical review as mandated by the federal government. Today the hospital is open for tours.",1994,"Radford, VA",,
Virginia,Tucker Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Tucker_Sanatorium,,,1916,Preserved,Single Building,,Tucker Pavilion at Chippenham Hospital,"The Price House at 212 West Franklin Street. It was built between 1803 and 1805 in one of Richmond’s earliest subdivisions. In the course of two centuries, it was home to a Revolutionary War hero, a U.S. president and a wealthy local businessman and philanthropist, before being converted first to a hospital and then a retirement home.
The Tucker Sanatorium in Richmond, Va. occupied the mansion where President James Monroe once lived. In 1916, the Dooleys sold the Price House, and it underwent another transformation, becoming first the Tucker Sanatorium and then Tucker Hospital. The building underwent significant modifications and expansions as the hospital grew. The building acquired two large wings, and the hospital bought the A. S. Smith House (circa 1870) next door and connected the two buildings.
After the hospital moved to Chesterfield County in 1976, the Price and Smith houses stood idle before undergoing another remodel and reopening in 1978 as a private retirement home called the Dooley Madison Home. The Dooley Madison Home closed in 2003. Today it has been refurbished and turned into the the Presidential Club Condominiums.",1976,"Richmond, VA",,
Virginia,Westbrook Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Westbrook_Sanatorium,,,1911,Demolished,Cottage Plan,,Westbrook Psychiatric Sanatorium | Charter Westbrook Psychiatric Hospital,"Lewis Ginter was an ex-Confederate and tobacco magnate who loved to build things. He built Ginter House on Franklin Street in 1892, the Jefferson Hotel in 1895, and North Side’s Ginter Park neighborhood, all gifts to Richmond’s architecture portfolio. He also purchased an old plantation called Westbrook, and turned it into a Queen Anne mansion, with help from the architect who designed Maymont for James H. Dooley. (Shockoe Examiner) It was quite the spiff affair, featuring, among other things, a private barbershop, and one-lane bowling alley.
Ginter died in 1897, and by 1911 Westbrook had been converted to a sanatorium, complete with its own truck farm, dairy, and poultry yard. The sanatorium was located on 30 lushly landscaped acres consisting of seven buildings, some segregated as to men or women, as well as cottages with four to 12 rooms each. The institution moved to new location as Charter Westbrook Psychiatric Hospital in 1975. All original buildings demolished and replaced with a single 8-story building, now used as a retirement home.",1975,"Richmond, VA",,
Virginia,Northern Virginia Training Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Northern_Virginia_Training_Center,,,1973,Closed,Cottage Plan,,,"The Northern Virginia Training Center first opened its doors in April, 1973 as one of five residential training centers in the Commonwealth to serve people with intellectual and related disabilities. Since its inception, the Northern Virginia Training Center has been committed to improving the lives of people affected by intellectual disabilities. The NVTC was once home to more than 250 residents on-site and employed more than 550 people providing services to residents and non-residents alike, including people coming from Fairfax, Alexandria, Arlington, Prince William and Loudoun Counties.
However, in the summer of 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Olmstead v L.C. that unjustified segregating of people with disabilities from society constitutes discrimination and is a violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which ultimately forced the NVTC to close in 2016.",2016,"Fairfax, VA",,
Virginia,Southeastern Virginia Training Center,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Southeastern_Virginia_Training_Center,,,1975,Active,Cottage Plan,,,"Since 1975 Southeastern Virginia Training Center has been one of the service options in the community-based system of supports for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families who live in Health Planning Region 5 (HPR V). HPR V includes the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach as well as the Colonial, Western Tidewater, Middle Peninsula/Northern Neck, and Eastern Shore Community Services Boards.
When first built, SEVTC provided habilitation and support services to individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Two hundred people in residence lived in twenty 8 and 10-bed cottages where supports and training were provided. Many of the residents planned to live in their home communities and SEVTC provided parent/family training and a quick transition back to community residences. Today those now living at SEVTC often have significant disabilities and or behavioral disorders, making community living more difficult.
There has also been a transition from a focus on remediation of skill deficits and matching people to programs, to an emphasis on strengths and the adaptation of environments to support the interests and abilities of individuals. The impetus for this change has largely come from the individuals for whom we have been providing services. Individuals with disabilities do not consider themselves to be “broken” or in need of being “fixed”. Rather, they seek to live their lives in ways that are consistent with their own interests, preferences, and aspirations. During the last ten years, Virginia’s Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS) has engaged in a major transformation initiative to replace its historic emphasis on institutionally based care to one that promotes opportunities for individuals to fully participate in community life.
The facility at SEVTC that opened in 1975 was not designed to serve the population it now supports. The individuals who are being served today have severe and profound disabilities and many have serious medical or behavioral complexities. They require services and 24-hour a day supports that are highly structured and intensive. The medical and behavioral needs are projected to increase in the years to come and as the population ages. Reflecting this change, SEVTC opened in 2012 a new state of the art neighborhood. Fifteen homes each supporting 5 individuals while at the same time community capacity was expanded and many of the individuals living at SEVTC moved into the community based housing.
In 2012 DBHDS entered into an agreement with the United States Department of Justice to close all of Virginia’s Training Centers except SEVTC by 2020. [1]",,"Chesapeake, VA",,

Virginia,Virginia State Epileptic Colony,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Virginia_State_Epileptic_Colony,1910,,1911,Closed,Cottage Plan,,State colony for Epileptics & Feeble-Minded (1919-1940) | Lynchburg State Colony (1940-1954) | Lynchburg Training School and Hospital (1954-1983) | Central Virginia Training Center (1983-2020),"Established as the Virginia State Epileptic Colony in 1910, the facility is located on a tract of land overlooking the James River in Amherst County. The property, known as ""Morissana"" was purchased from Bessie Willis and others in 1909, using funds obtained through the sale of the nearby ""Murkland"" tract that had been deeded to Western State Hospital in 1905. The facility was originally designed to serve 100 persons with epilepsy, to be drawn from the 3 state mental hospitals (Western, Eastern and Southwestern) existing at the time. The first patients were admitted on May 16, 1911.
The Drewry-Gilliam building was named in honor of Dr. William F. Drewry and Mr. Robert Gilliam of Petersburg for their efforts to secure a state facility for epileptics. Constructed at a cost of $24,420, the building, referred to as a ""cottage,"" contained a dining room, laundry room, serving room, pantries, kitchen, cold storage room, toilet room and a coal storage room in the basement. The two upper stories contained two 40 bed wards, dormitories, living rooms, attendant’s rooms, linen rooms and lavatories. Other features of the original site plan included the three story colonial mansion ""Morissana"" which was renovated as the Executive/Administration Building.
There was also a brick, two story colonial cottage for 20 patients created by enlarging the existing servant’s house, a boiler and power house created from the existing stable, yards and sheds for hogs and cattle, and a newly constructed .76 mile spur track of the Norfolk and Western Rail Road to bring supplies to the facility. Starting in 1913, with the construction of the 60 bed Mastin-Minor building, the facility was prepared to accept ""feeble-minded"" women into residence.
In 1919, the average resident population of the Colony was 508, with 351 classed as epileptics and 157 characterized as ""feeble-minded."" The biennial report for 1919-21 stated that the facility name was changed to the State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded to reflect this change in the resident population. By 1926, the facility reported a population of 845, composed of 347 male and 164 female epileptics and 334 female mentally retarded patients.
Based on the uninformed view of mental illness and mental retardation that received both popular and scientific support at the time, the concept of sterilization for certain classes of facility residents may have been discussed from the time of its founding in 1910. However, in 1913, the facility superintendent noted that sterilization ""can never become a general procedure, on account of the many objections that can be raised to it, nor in practical results compare with … segregation and custodial control…"" (4th Annual Report, 1913). Unfortunately, in October of 1927, the Colony nevertheless became formally enmeshed in the now discredited ""Eugenics"" movement. Acting pursuant to a Virginia law (Chapter 394, Acts of the General Assembly, 1924) that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in  Buck v. Bell, the facility embarked on an ill-advised program of involuntary sterilization, combined with routine appendectomies, of so-called ""mental defectives with cacogenic potentialities"" (19th Annual Report, 1927-28). Although ""Eugenic"" sterilizations were last noted in the facility annual report for 1956, medical sterilizations may have continued until 1972.
In 1940, the type of individual served was omitted from the facility name, and it became known as simply the Lynchburg State Colony. During that year, the facility had 2019 residents under treatment, and, for the first time, allowed social visitation between male and female patients. According to the Superintendent, ""We have continued to allow most of our male patients to call upon their female patient friends for a hour or so each Sunday afternoon. This radical experiment has proven to be a most successful one. Just how much this has been responsible for the diminution in the number of elopements from the Colony, I cannot say…"".
In the early to mid 1950’s, national emphasis on development of training programs marked a new era in the field of mental retardation. A variety of new training programs were introduced for patients and, by 1955, two thirds of the residents had the benefit of training conducted by a staff of 28 teachers. Efforts were also made to increase staff skills.  In 1952, a state approved attendant training program consisting of 115 hours of instruction in patient care was started at the Colony. By June of 1955, 155 attendants had completed the course and received a certificate of proficiency. In keeping with this change in focus, the General Assembly changed the facility’s name in 1954 to Lynchburg Training School and Hospital.
The farm that had been started in the earliest days of the Colony continued in operation, with varying degrees of success, into the 1950’s. In addition to the cultivation of soybeans, wheat, corn, vegetables and hay, the facility farm also maintained herds of Holstein dairy cattle and Duroc, Yorkshire and Berkshire hogs. The farm, which employed many of the facility residents, usually operated at a profit. However, specific events such as the loss of the barn and contents to fire in 1921, variations of market prices for farm produce, and seasonal weather patterns resulting in drought or excessive moisture, did occasionally cause deficit operations for the year.  In 1958, the cow barn was torn down and the dairy barn converted to a temporary dormitory.  By 1968, all that remained of farm operations was a greenhouse for horticulture that had been constructed and maintained with Federal funding.
Client population continued to increase during the 1950’s, and reached 2,347 in 1956. This led to unavoidable overcrowding, and, in 1957, an admission rate of 5 per week was established as a guide and control for space management. After 62 new beds were added in 1962 and 284 in 1963, the admission rate raised to 6 per week in 1964 and 7 per week in 1965. This increased rate of admissions naturally continued to raise the overall  resident population, even though the facility had stopped the practice of holding patients for Western State Hospital in 1967.  Finally, when the resident population reached 3686 in 1972, the facility found it necessary to discontinue admissions altogether.
By 1979, overcrowding and admissions pressure on the facility had been reduced by the State's creation of 3 additional regional centers to care for the mentally retarded. This expansion and other factors such as the creation of Community Service Boards and the establishment of discharge planning as an integral part of the admissions procedure, had reduced the LTS&H resident population to 2154. The remaining residents ranged in age from 3 to 83, and were in the severe to profound range of mental retardation. Many also had severe physical disabilities.
On July 1, 1983, the facility’s name was changed to the Central Virginia Training Center to reflect its geographic location. A year later, the campground for residents was opened, and the resident population had decreased to 1724. Between 1982 and 1984, the facility reflected a trend toward the care of the more seriously disabled population. Although there was an 8% overall decrease in population during this period, the percentage of residents classified as profoundly mentally retarded actually increased due to the dramatic reduction in the number higher functioning residents through community placement.
The U.S. Department of Justice began a three-year investigation into CVTC and other training centers in 2008. The investigation found Virginia harmed patients in training centers by keeping them in institutions, finding residents had little to no interaction with those who are not disabled, denied freedoms of choice and sometimes physically or chemically restrained. The Department of Justice demanded the state shut down training centers and, in 2012, Virginia agreed to close all but one. That year, the CVTC had 360 residents and 1,250 employees.
The Lynchburg Regional Business Alliance announced the first stages of a redevelopment plan for the Central Virginia Training Center in Madison Heights in 2020.
Since its creation, the facility has maintained a 6 acre cemetery on grounds.  The first recorded burial,  that of a 16 year old boy,  took place on June 27, 1911, a little over one month after the first patients were admitted.  As of January 2005, the cemetery held 1028 graves.  Most interments were of  the men, women and children who lived at the facility.  One such grave is that of a facility resident who was a Confederate veteran, having served as a private with Co. F, 37th VA Infantry.  A few graves, however, hold clients of other state facilities and one grave is marked ""Unknown.""  CVTC maintains a complete record of all burials that includes grave number, name, date of birth and date of death.

Virginia,Virginia Industrial School for Boys,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Virginia_Industrial_School_for_Boys,1890,,1892,Closed,Cottage Plan,,Beaumont School for Boys | Beaumont Learning Center | Beaumont Juvenile Correctional Center,"In the north-central part of Powhatan County is located the state-owned and operated juvenile correctional center known as Beaumont Juvenile Correctional Center. It was founded in 1890 in Laurel, located north of Richmond. The first of four schools established in Virginia for the care of delinquent children, it was formerly called The Virginia Industrial School for Boys and Beaumont Learning Center. In 1920, the school was moved to Beaumont, and the property known as Beaumont, Estranola and Bullocks (part of an original grant from the King of England to the Michaux family of Powhatan) was purchased with the property totaling 2,400 acres. In 1922, the school that was formerly under the State Board of Charities and Corrections was placed under the Children's Bureau of the state board of public welfare.
The Children's Bureau then became the agency that decided whether the child would be sent to Beaumont. The Reorganization Act of 1927 changed the name of the State Board of Public Welfare to the State Department of Public Welfare; however, the facility was still controlled by the board under the general direction of that department. In 1942, the General Assembly passed a law, which abolished the Board of Directors, and put the facility under the care of the State Department of Public Welfare and the Commissioner of Public Welfare. In 1952, a Division of Youth Services that included Beaumont was formed in the Department of Welfare and Institutions.
Due to a lack of facilities prior to 1959, many residents spent a good portion of their time working on Beaumont's farm, or otherwise maintaining the institution. During 1959, a new academic and vocational building was completed, offering an expanded academic program and vocational opportunities. A second phase or expansion was completed in 1972, which, along with ending the farming operation, allowed every resident to attend academic school (approximately 90% received vocational training). From 1974 until June of 1990, Beaumont was part of the Division of Youth Services in the Department of Corrections. In 1990, a new state agency was created for juvenile corrections, known as The Department of Youth and Family Services. The name of the agency was changed in 1996 to the Department of Juvenile Justice, of which Beaumont is currently a part.
Approximately 200 residents were moved in 1997 from the old cottages to two new medium security buildings. A maximum security building opened in January 1998 to house 122 residents. The historic cottages were converted to treatment, volunteer, and recreation offices. With the closure of the Hanover juvenile correctional facility in April 2013, some Hanover residents were relocated to Beaumont. As part of the same consolidation effort, residents of DJJ’s Oak Ridge program, formerly housed at a facility on the Bon Air JCC campus, also were relocated to Beaumont.",2017,"Beaumont, VA",,
Virginia,Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Virginia_Industrial_School_for_Colored_Girls,1911,,1915,Closed,Cottage Plan,Merrill C. Lee,Janie Porter Barrett School for Girls | Barrett Learning Center | Barrett Juvenile Correctional Center,"Janie Porter Barrett, founder of the Locust Street Settlement in Hampton, Virginia, was the driving force in establishing in 1915 The Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls. The school was started with 28 girls on donated property in Peak’s Turnout, Hanover County, a barren parcel of land noted mainly as a battle site during the Civil War. The Virginia State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs donated the land on which the school was developed and continued to be an important source of support for the school.
The residents of the Industrial School were, for the most part, delinquent or dependent African-American girls sentenced to prison by local judges and then paroled to the school. There were no foster homes for colored girls who needed care and jail or prison was the only alternative. It is reported that several of the girls were “feeble minded” and a few arrived with contagious diseases. Regardless of the circumstances, the goal of the school was to teach self-direction and character building with the expectation that, when ready, a girl could be “paroled” to a private family in the Richmond area and work for normal wages.
As noted in the school’s 2nd Annual Report of The Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls — 1917, the girls learned about and became engaged in routines of work, play, and religious activities. Among the work activities were the ordinary tasks of living in a rural setting: truck gardening, raising pigs, chickens and other animals. Housework skills such as laundry, ironing and dressmaking were also taught. Play activities focused on games, folk dancing, baseball and the celebration of holidays. Religious services in the early days rotated between an Episcopal and a Baptist service conducted by volunteer ministers.
Janie Porter Barrett retired in 1940 and died in 1948. In 1942, responsibility for the Industrial School was assumed by the Virginia Department of Welfare and Institutions. In 1950, Barrett’s training school was renamed the Janie Porter Barrett School for Girls. It became racially integrated in 1965, became coed in 1977, and then served an exclusively male population from 1978 until its closure in 2005. Since 2007, the Barrett Juvenile Correctional Center has been mothballed by the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice.",2005,"Hanover, VA",,

 W.E. Stainback and Pruitt and Brown Architects",Moore's Creek Sanitarium (1903 to 1914) |  Blue Ridge Tuberculosis Sanatorium (1919 to 1978) |  Blue Ridge Hospital (1978 to ~1996),"The Blue Ridge Sanatorium began life in 1902 when a group of Charlottesville area physicians lead by Dr. D.M. Trice[1] purchased 106 acres of land in the Blue Ridge foothills including farm structures, a spring, and the Lyman Mansion from Mrs. J.E. Lyman.[2]  The company soon acquired a charter from the state allowing them to hold voluntary and legally committed patients for treatment of nervous and mental disorders plus drug and alcohol problems.  Boasting steam heat, gas lighting, and indoor plumbing the Moore's Creek Sanitarium had a twenty-three patient capacity.  Men were housed on the second floor, and women on the first.  Typical of contemporary sanitariums the patients were engaged in outdoor activities on the former farm or in crafts indoors.
Trice's company dissolved in 1914 and the property lay unused until 1919.  In that year the Commonwealth of Virginia was looking for another tuberculosis sanatorium site to complement the original Catawba Sanatorium (for whites) and the Piedmont Sanatorium (for blacks).  Several factors made the former Moore's Creek site attractive to the Commonwealth.  Not only was the University of Virginia Medical School located nearby, but paved road access, mountain scenery plus money and water connections offered by the city made it a hard location to pass up.  The Lyman Mansion became the Administration (Davis) Building, central facility of the sanatorium.  Even as the facility expanded it maintained the connection to the land begun by Moore's Creek.  The Sanatorium largely subsisted on the produce it raised and a surplus of milk produced by the dairy farm on the property was sold in the city.
The first addition to the property were the three pavilions, designed to the then modern concept of providing as much fresh air as possible to help cure patients.  Built to the same plans as the Morton pavilion at the Piedmont Sanatorium they were two story buildings of frame construction with wings off the sides of a central core housing the main facilities.  The porches on the southern faces of the wings were key to the fresh air theory, allowing patients to be outside while being protected from the elements.  Named Addison, Strode, and Thomas they housed forty patients a piece segregated by sex.  Men were housed in Strode, women in Addison, and children in Thomas.  Patients in advanced stages were housed in partitioned off rooms in the rear of the building until construction of the Trinkle Infirmary in 1922.  As a state project the cottages were constructed of the cheapest materials, plainly furnished, and not expected to be in use for more then ten or twenty years at max.  As early as their first months of service problems in the hastily built structures became apparent.  The end began in 1939 with the opening of the WPA funded infirmary building; in 1950 the patients living in the rotted Addison and Thomas pavilions were finally moved to the west wing of the 1939 infirmary.  In 1951 all patients remaining in Strode were moved to the Trinkle Building.[3]
When prominent Virginia Mason George W. Wright died in 1924, the Masonic lodges of the Commonwealth raised funds for construction of a pavilion in his name at Blue Ridge.  Several conditions were stipulated in their offer to the sanatorium (such as Masons and their families having priority for admission and would approve changes; the Masons would also provide the equipment for the treatment of patients).  On July 14, 1926 the cornerstone was lain for George W. Wright Building to great fanfare, with Masons and other dignitaries coming from all over the state.  Consisting of two floors, a basement, and a roof garden to provide patients with sun the brand new fireproof building held sixty patients.  Built to the same principle as the earlier wooden pavilions each floor had a single corridor with rooms and southern facing porches.  It also held a brand new treatment room, called the Alpine lamp, to expose patients to ultra-violet rays in hopes of curing the Tuberculosis in their body.  On the first floor was also an operating room where artificial pneuomothorax surgical procedures were performed.  Consisting of the lungs being deflated and allowed to rest it was considered the second best treatment after the open air treatment.  Completed in 1927 the Mason Relief Fund continued to support the building until the institution closed.[4]
Another 1926 addition was the Children's Preventorium, also known as the Garrett Building, which replaced the Thomas pavilion as the primary facility for care of children.  Located some distance away from the main campus in an open field, it embodied the importance of separating the children from those adults suffering from advance stages of the disease.  Serving as a home, hospital, and school the patients were kept away from any potential further exposure.  Young patients received the same treatment as their seniors; open air sleeping on porches, exposure to the sun, and physical activity.  The hope was that if caught at a young age, rigorous treatment could prevent development of full on Tuberculosis.  Thanks to the agricultural activities of the Sanatorium, the preventorium was entirely self-sufficient.  Every effort was made to make the children feel at home with holiday parties and regular activities.  As a result of the 1944 Lymanhurst study which revealed no positive benefit to the preventorium plans began being made to close the Garrett Building, culminating in the final shut down June 1, 1950.  The building was last used to house male staff members before it was torn down in the late 1950s.[5]
In 1939 the Sanatorium secured $167,726 in funding from the Works Progress Administration plus funding from the Commonwealth to construct the one hundred bed art-deco Infirmary-Culinary building, commonly referred to as the East Wing.  While it contained a larger interior infirmary wards, it still possessed southern facing porches to provide patients with fresh air and a view much like the pavilions it replaced.  After the discovery of the Tuberculosis antibiotic in 1944 the open air porches were converted to private rooms.[6]  Later construction included the Prisoner Barracks and Stafford Hall staff housing.
By the 1950s the increased use of the Tuberculosis antibiotic meant fewer patients were committed to the sanatorium, with the first lasting vacancies opening in 1954.  The average age of committed patients also increased the challenges faced in providing care, as the decade wore on.  In 1965 Blue Ridge opened its doors to African American patients as the Piedmont Sanatorium was closed.  Treatment programs were expanded in the early 1970s, and outpatient alcoholic treatment programs opened at the Sanatorium.  By 1978 the sanatorium facilities were transferred to the University of Virginia, who renamed it Blue Ridge Hospital.  While it continued to treat Tuberculosis patients, many other UVA medical and outpatient services were moved to the campus in the 1980s.[7]  Blue Ridge Hospital was finally closed for good in 1996, bringing to an end almost a hundred years of medical use of the Lyman Farm.[8]
The property was transferred to the UVA Foundation in 2001. The Foundation stabilized eleven buildings on the property for potential future use at the University’s direction, including a barn, various silos, Wright Hall, the Chapel, Lyman Mansion, and the Bradbury houses.

Virginia,Catawba Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Catawba_Sanatorium,,,1908 (state owned),Active,Cottage Plan,,Catawba Hospital,"The land on which Catawba Hospital stands has a history of healing dating back to 1857. That was the year several businessmen from Salem, VA discovered the potential of sulphur and limestone springs on Catawba mountain.  In June of 1858, they opened Roanoke Red Sulphur Springs Resort.  The 700 acre resort extended up the mountain from the Catawba Valley.  It lies ten miles north of Salem on the northern border of Roanoke County, VA.  Joe Chapman later bought the Roanoke Red Sulphur Springs resort.
Chapman catered to people who wanted to escape to the mountains for the good, clean, healthful air and the peace and quiet that this remote resort offered. Chapman advertised his water as being valuable in the treatment of lung diseases.  He shipped the spring water around the country and dubbed it, ""Catawba Iron or All Healing"". At the height of its popularity, the main hotel accommodated 300 guests. Residents of Roanoke were repeat guests at the resorts which  continued to operate until 1908.
By the early 1900s, the resort attracted many tuberculosis victims. In 1908, the Commonwealth of Virginia purchased the property from the Chapman family.  The Commonwealth appropriated $40,000 to establish the first Tuberculosis Sanatorium. Initially wooden pavilions housed TB patients.  Patients in 1909 were treated to fresh air (cold or hot), plenty of sunshine, rest and as much food as they could handle. These were the only known treatments for Tuberculosis until the advent of thoracic surgery around 1920. Tuberculosis was eventually brought under control with the invention of Streptomycin and Isonicotinic Hydrazide (INH) in the late 1940s and 1950s.
In 1972, Catawba Hospital became part of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (in 2009, renamed to Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services) as a treatment and rehabilitation center for the psychiatric needs of geriatric patients.  In 1981, a unit for acute, short-term psychiatric treatment of patients ages 18-64 was opened.  In 1985, Catawba Hospital received accreditation from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  Part of the Commonwealth of Virginia public behavioral health system, Catawba Hospital specializes in serving adults including geriatric individuals who are in need of mental health care.",,"Catawba, VA",,
Virginia,DeJarnette Sanitarium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=DeJarnette_Sanitarium,,,1932,Closed,Single Building,,DeJarnette Center for Human Development | DeJarnette Center,"The DeJarnette Sanitarium was founded in 1932 by Dr. Joseph DeJarnette, who was also the director of the nearby Western State Hospital (the sanitarium was a private unit for middle-income patients that operated separately from the government-supported state hospital). DeJarnette was a respected doctor among the white Virginia elite at the time, but his career would ultimately be defined by his strong support for eugenics, specifically the forced sterilization of the mentally ill and others he deemed “defective.” DeJarnette drew fresh inspiration from Nazi Germany’s 1933 Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring, Hitler’s opening bid to purge the Reich of its genetically and racially “inferior” stock. In 1934 DeJarnette calculated that 56,244 defectives had already been sterilized under the new regime.
The institution maintained financial independence from its foundation in 1932 until it was re-formatted in 1975, and at that time, was absorbed into the state-managed health-care system as it existed in the 1970s. At the time of the conversion, patients above the age of 21 were transferred to the relatively new campus of Western State Hospital, which had moved from downtown Staunton to its current location (parallel to the DeJarnette Center, on the opposite side of Richmond Road) during the early 1960s.
In 1996, the DeJarnette Center relocated to a new 48-bed facility, adjacent to the grounds of Western State Hospital. In 2004, plans were made to demolish the original DeJarnette complex, and to replace it with a shopping mall and parking lot. However, plans for the project fell through when not enough tenants were secured for the proposed mall. As of 2011, the campus of the former DeJarnette Center for Human Development still exists, though in a considerable state of disrepair.",1996,"Staunton, VA",,

Virginia,Piedmont Sanatorium,https://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Piedmont_Sanatorium,1918,,,Active,Cottage Plan,,Piedmont Geriatric Hospital,"The first location considered for Piedmont Sanatorium was in Ivor, Virginia. Ivor's citizens detested the idea of building a sanatorium for blacks in their town. After rejecting the location in Ivor, the Piedmont Sanatorium committee visited a site in Lynchburg, Virginia. Here again, the committee met opposition from the citizens of Lynchburg and ""any idea of such purchase was immediately abandoned."" By 1917, a real estate agent named Mr. Barnes was hired to negotiate the purchase of a site in Burkeville. To avoid a situation similar to what had taken place in Ivor and Lynchburg, the committee asked a group of citizens from the Burkeville area to sign a statement which said the sanatorium could be built there. Despite the signed statement, complaints emerged for the third time. The State Board of Health received a letter from an attorney named Mr. H.H. Watson who wrote on behalf of a group of citizens who did not want the sanatorium to be located in Burkeville. This time, the State Board of Health ignored the opposition and continued making plans for the erection of the new Piedmont Sanatorium.
The experimental nature of Piedmont Sanatorium is evident in the pavilion architecture at that facility. Initially, only one pavilion was planned for Piedmont Sanatorium. This building, named for Miss Agnes Randolph, was a one-story frame structure that was left open on one side and ""screened with heavy curtains."" The pavilion cost $8,041, When construction began at Blue Ridge Sanatorium, this facility received three wood frame pavilions complete with sleeping porches which have been described as simple and unassuming. Nevertheless, they were covered in stucco giving Blue Ridge a more permanent and appealing nature than the modest and experimental Piedmont. Also, the Piedmont pavilion provided space for 25 patients, whereas the Blue Ridge pavilions provided space for 120 patients. It seems that the State Board of Health did not want to invest a great deal of capital at Piedmont until they were certain that the facility would succeed.
The Administration building cost $14,286.00, a good deal more than the cost of the first pavilion. The structure is made of solid brick laid in five-course American bond. It has decorative fenestration with segmental arches supporting the weight of the wall above each window. It also has a two story porch with a decorative railing which somewhat resembles Chinese Chippendale and four square columns with simple capitals at the top. The interior is spacious with relatively high ceilings. The staff dined in an upstairs room that has an elaborately coffered plaster ceiling. Overall, the building resembles the elements found in colonial revival buildings. In looking at the relationship between the administration building and the patient pavilions at Piedmont, a hierarchy is established which orders not only the built environment but also the regimen of daily life at Piedmont. Brick is normally considered to be more substantial than wood and, in this case, the brick of the administration building communicates that the power of the institution lies with the administration and not in the patient occupied space. Further supporting this message was the administration building's location between the first two patient pavilions. The two-story structure towered above the small pavilions and created a point from which the patient pavilions could be kept under watch.
Everything at Piedmont was hierarchically ordered and routine. Patients were expected to follow a specific regimen as part of their treatment. A pamphlet given out to all new patients sheds light on what this routine consisted of. Every morning, patients were awakened at 7:15 a.m. They had breakfast and then rest followed by lunch, and more rest. From 1:45 until 4:00 p.m., the quiet hour demanded that noone should speak. Some patients who were further advanced in their treatment exercised at certain times of the day. At 6:00 p.m. the patients ate supper and at 9:30 p.m., they went to bed. This routine is very similar if not identical to the one at Blue Ridge sanatorium.
An important goal of the treatment of tubercular blacks was their eventual re-entry into productive society. In 1919, Miss Helen Morris was hired as the sanatorium's first occupational therapist. She led the patients in handicraft activities. Some patients were taught skills that they would be able to use once returning to the real world. Piedmont patients were also expected to serve as role models for tubercular blacks who could not come to Piedmont. The Piedmont staff taught their patients the proper ways to dispose of sputum and other ways to handle the ills of tuberculosis in hopes that their patients would return to their home communities and teach other African-Americans about tuberculosis.
Educating the black population about tuberculosis took place both on and off the Piedmont site. Patients at the sanatorium were required to attend weekly lectures to learn more about tuberculosis. Field clinics were established to diagnose blacks in other areas of Virginia and to give advice on dealing with the disease. By focusing on the black population as a whole, rather than merely the patients who received treatment at the sanatorium, Piedmont provided widespread benefits to society.
Shortly after the sanatorium opened, a nursing school for black women was established on the Piedmont site. The Nursing School at Piedmont Sanatorium offered a tuberculosis specific curriculum. The program was only for two years and allowed black women to become certified specifically in tuberculosis nursing. If these women wanted to become registered nurses, they had to complete a third year of training at St. Phillips Hospital in Richmond. The ultimate goal of establishing the nursing school for tuberculosis, it may be assumed, was to have these nurses work with the black population at large to fight tuberculosis.
The architectural landscape of Piedmont Sanatorium in the middle decades of the twentieth century looked remarkably different than it had at the beginning. In addition to the Carter Building, the Works Progress Administration building, and the new Nurses' Dormitory, a wooden chapel with a south-facing tower had been constructed in 1923. Blue Ridge Sanatorium also had a chapel which was completed in 1925. This Gothic style building was made of stone and closely resembled the chapel at Catawba Sanatorium in southwestern Virginia. Once again, Blue Ridge's superiority to Piedmont is asserted in the differences in building materials. Furthermore, the inclusion of a polygonal apse at the Blue Ridge chapel makes this building's plan architecturally more significant than the simple rectilinear form used for the Piedmont chapel.
The modern building at Piedmont Sanatorium, which was constructed in 1940, added 79 beds for adults and space for children. It was a modern streamlined building made of concrete with large windows in the central portion of the façade. Blue Ridge Sanatorium also received a similar building with help from the Works Progress Administration. A conscious effort was made to have the design of Blue Ridge's modern building compliment the other architecture at the site. No such allowance seems to have been made at Piedmont. The Blue Ridge building is brick and has elaborate art-deco ornamentation around the windows and entranceway. An examination of the plans for these two buildings shows that the sleeping porch was still used at the time of construction for the Blue Ridge building, but sleeping porches were omitted from the Piedmont building.
By 1965, Piedmont Sanatorium closed and black patients were admitted to Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the first time. An anonymous history of Blue Ridge Sanatorium provides an account of the integration, The staff in general received the new arrivals as people who were sick and needed care.
In 2004, the state Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse proposed building a facility to house 150 of Virginia's most dangerous sex offenders on PGH grounds. The facility would be self-contained and not occupy the same buildings as PGH. Reasons for selecting the Burkeville site included its proximity to Nottoway Correctional Center, which could provide backup security help, and the nearby temporary sex offenders unit in Dinwiddie, whose workers could easily transition to the new facility. The offenders in question fall under the control of the DMHMRS, rather than the prison system, because they have completed their prison sentences but still meet the criteria for civil commitment as sexually violent .
